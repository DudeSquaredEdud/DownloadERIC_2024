        "description":"This unit for grade 12 is concerned with both the methods and purposes of the historical study of phonology, morphology, and syntax in the English language. The introduction to the unit illustrates language change in Old, Middle, and Modern English versions of &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; and examines the causes of current language changes as preparation for understanding that the same causes operated in the past. A study of phonological changes leads the students to investigate vowel changes from the time of Chaucer to the present; to understand assimilation, metathesis, and dissimilation; and to comprehend reasons for the changes. Morphological differences are examined in two dialects of Middle English, in Old, Middle, and Modern English versions of &quot;The Lord's Prayer,&quot; and in different  versions of &quot;The Canterbury Tales.&quot; In addition, past and present cultural subgroups are shown to have affected morphology; and morphological change and contact with other cultures are shown to have contributed to syntactic change. Suggested lectures, discussion questions, and worksheets are included, and appendices contain an outline of unit 905 (see TE 001 273) which deals with lexical change. (JS)",

        "description":"The purposes of this unit are to help the 12th-grade student understand that language can be used to evoke an experience, to enrich his perception of the evocative language of literature, and to demonstrate that evocation is not limited to either language or literature. The unit begins with a study of the evocative language in a radio announcer's description of President Kennedy's funeral cortege, of the role of ritual in suggesting the significance of an act, and of poetry in attempting to evoke experience. For an understanding of how evocation is related to motive, Kenneth Burke's dramatistic point of view is applied to motivation as seen in life and as re-created in literature. Next, the classification of writing (as descriptive-referential, pure-referential, and  pragmatic-referential), the human tendency to create symbols, the use of figurative language, and T.S. Eliot's concept of the &quot;objective correlative&quot; are examined and related to selected works. Study questions for the use of evocative language in William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; discussion questions, and sample lectures are included. (See TE 001 328, TE 001 329, TE 001 332 for 10th- and 11th-grade units on discourse.) (JS)",

        "description":"Designed as a synthesis of concepts familiar to students having studied the earlier Minnesota Project English units or as an introduction for other students, this unit for grade 12 treats the role of language in the social and psychological development of man. Alternative introductions to the unit are provided: one concentrating on definitions of language, man's unique symbol-making ability, and the importance of language; the other dealing with what is meant by &quot;knowing&quot; a language. The unit then develops concepts related to the role of language in social interaction, language as a reflection of culture, the relationship between language and reality, the process of communication, interferences based on a person's language or dialect, levels of usage, and stereotyping by  language. The concepts are presented through sample lectures, discussion questions, and suggested readings; additional readings for gifted students and a bibliography on the role of language are included.

After a brief discussion of the definition of criticism, the unit proceeds to the establishment of standards for evaluating persuasive discourse, standards involving Kenneth Burke's pentad: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. The unit then deals with three categories of discourse which can be evaluated--the single speech or article, the persuasive discourse of a person, and the persuasive discourse of a movement. To aid in the process of criticism itself, a format of questions is set up to require the students to place the speech in a meaningful context, to analyze the speech itself, and to assess the effects of the speech. Finally, this format is used in a sample analysis  of Douglas MacArthur's &quot;Address to Congress.&quot; Procedural notes for the teacher, lectures, and discussion questions are included. (JS)",

        "description":"Although many factors lead students, particularly the culturally disadvantaged, to avoid reading, among the most significant reasons are an abhorrence of the kinds of readings contained in their English anthologies, and the physical characteristics of these books. If the schools are to encourage reading as a broadening experience, they must furnish students with interest-provoking materials which are easy to read at those places where their reading is normally done--on buses or at lunch counters, for example. One technique for improving the teaching of literature would be for the school to give each student, every year, 10 inexpensive paper back books of literary quality, yet of interest to them. These paperbacks are easily read in the student's natural reading situations, are  comfortable to hold and transport, and could be marked by the student without fear of recrimination from the school. In addition, the student would begin to feel a pride in the ownership of books, and these books might become the first step in making reading a vital part of the life in culturally-disadvantaged homes.

        "description":"A research program on teaching instrumental music tested the value of concept learning for beginning band pupils for the first 12 weeks of their instruction. Eighteen randomly selected schools from Montana, Colorado, and Wyoming provided fifth-grade students (9 control classes and 9 experimental classes) who met in classes of 18 pupils for two 50-minute periods per week for 12 weeks. Seven basic music concepts (e.g., physical design of the instrument, ideal tone quality, correct note length, rhythm) were developed and taught. Students were evaluated by the \"Watkins-Farnum Performance Scale\" and the Colwell \"Elementary Music Achievement Test.\" An analysis of the data indicated that the concept approach to teaching beginning band pupils was (1) superior to traditional methods for  teaching students to perform on woodwinds, upper brass, and drums, (2) especially effective in teaching students with high or average music ability and students with low or average IQ's, (3) as effective as traditional teaching methods for developing aural-discrimination skills, (4) equally effective with boys and girls, and (5) superior to present teaching methods in developing performance skills for all pupils.

The unit begins with evidence of the Court's deciding different ways at different times in similar cases, and proceeds to an investigation of the Court Packing fight of the 1930's, in which the Court emerges as a distinctly political institution. In subsequent sections, the student investigates the origins of the Court, the principle of judicial review, and the views of those who believe that the Court acts \"unconstitutionally\" and/or \"undemocratically.\" Final sections raise the question of how American liberties are protected in a majoritarian \"government of laws.\"  (Author)",

The major finding from 2 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance comparisons of teacher descriptions for IQ equivalent subgroups was that the effect of race tended to be contingent on scholastic aptitude and was clearly not dependent on sex. Teachers described higher IQ Negro students as favorably as they described higher IQ Other students but the lower IQ Negro pupil was more likely than the lower IQ Other child to be seen as maladjusted, verbally aggressive, and low  in task orientation. A second finding was that boys were described as more maladjusted, more verbally aggressive, more introverted, and less task oriented than were girls. (Authors)",

Employability depends on a number of factors other than school completion--for example race, caste, socioeconomic status, health, and emotional stability. The extreme valuation which society places on the diploma \"may also reflect widespread faith and vested interest in universal, free, compulsory education.\" Moreover, the high school diploma by itself  cannot guarantee freedom from poverty and alienation.

WE KNOW THAT A WORD'S MEANING MAY VARY ACCORDING TO SPEAKER, WRITER, LISTENER, READER, OR SITUATION, BUT FEW OF US WERE TRAINED TO DETECT FACT FROM FICTION AND TO ADVISE OTHERS ABOUT THIS DISTINCTION. NEVERTHELESS, WE, AS ENGLISH TEACHERS, MUST BE OUR STUDENTS' INTERPRETERS OF THE WORLD THAT WORDS STAND FOR, AND, THEREFORE, TEACHING ONLY GRAMMAR AND RHETORIC IS INSUFFICIENT. SINCE TOMORROW'S CRITICS ARE IN OUR CLASSROOMS TODAY, LET US TEACH THEM ABOUT SEMANTICS AND THE SYMBOLIC PROCESS, AND SO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE LINGUISTIC  INSIGHT TO HANDLE THE PROBLEMS COMMON TO ALL MEDIA.

DATA WERE COLLECTED ON ALL STUDENTS IN THREE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS (N-2327) AND 12 DANISH SECONDARY SCHOOLS (N-1552) USING A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE. DATA ALSO WERE OBTAINED FROM 68 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS' MOTHERS IN AMERICA AND 75 PERCENT IN DENMARK. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ADOLESCENT SUBCULTURES IN BOTH CULTURES ARE NOT SEPARATE OR ISOLATED SUBSOCIETIES BUT RATHER REFLECT THE ORIENTATION OF THE LARGER SOCIETIES SURROUNDING THEM. THE DATA, IN CONTRAST TO EARLIER THEORIES, SUGGEST THAT  IN IMPORTANT AREAS OF BEHAVIOR AND ATTITUDE, ADOLESCENTS DISPLAY HIGH CONCORDANCE WITH BOTH PARENTS AND PEERS, OR LOW CONCORDANCE WITH BOTH. ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS IN AMERICA ARE MORE CONCERNED THAN THE DANES WITH WINNING THE REGARD OF OTHERS. (AUTHOR)",

SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF THE COMPARISON OF THE DROPOUTS AND NONDROPOUTS SHOWED  THAT--(1) THERE WAS MORE FAMILY INSTABILITY AMONG DROPOUTS IN GENERAL, AND MORE AMONG NEGROES IN PARTICULAR, (2) THERE WERE MORE DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS AND MORE ABSENTEEISM AMONG DROPOUTS, (3) THE COURSE OF STUDY OF THE DROPOUTS TENDED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN GENERAL OR INDUSTRIAL ARTS FOR THE BOYS AND GENERAL OR COMMERCIAL COURSES FOR THE GIRLS, AND (4) IQ SCORES WERE LOWER FOR DROPOUTS AND LOWER FOR NEGROES THAN WHITES. ALSO, SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AS FAMILY STABILITY, LONG RESIDENCE IN THE STATE, AND HIGHER FAMILY INCOME SEEMED TO BE RELATED TO HIGHER ACADEMIC AVERAGES AMONG THE NEGRO RESPONDENTS. (JL)",

THE REVIEW DESCRIBES THE PROTEST MOVEMENT AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE INTEGRATION ATTEMPTS IN EACH CITY. ALL THE NEGRO PROTEST MOVEMENTS WERE CONSERVATIVE ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE EXISTING INTEGRATED EDUCATION AS SANCTIONED BY LAW. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH IN THE TWO STATES WHERE THE ISSUE WAS BROUGHT TO COURT, THE HIGHEST JUDICIAL AUTHORITY SUSTAINED THE NEGROES' CASE, THE SCHOOLS IN THESE CITIES REMAINED SEGREGATED. AMONG THE SUGGESTED REASONS FOR THE FAILURE OF THE INTEGRATION EFFORTS WERE THE EFFECTS OF CLEAVAGES WITHIN THE NEGRO COMMUNITY DUE TO CONFLICTING  SELF-INTERESTS.

HOWEVER, FEELINGS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND POSSIBILITY OF ATTENDING COLLEGE DECREASED DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR. NO SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CHANGE WAS FOUND IN STUDENTS' ORIENTATION TOWARDS THE FUTURE DURING EITHER PHASE OF THE PROGRAM. STUDENTS RANKED OUTSTANDING PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS  AS--SENSITIVITY TO INDIVIDUALS, ENCOURAGEMENT OF STUDENT AUTONOMY, SUPPORT OF SELF-CONCEPT, GROUP HARMONY, AND FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH PROGRAM PROBLEMS. THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF THE STUDENTS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR FOLLOWING THEIR SUMMER EXPERIENCE WAS POSITIVE AND GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL PATTERN FOR UB STUDENTS. THE PROGRAM WAS CONSIDERED &quot;APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE&quot; FOR ITS STUDENTS. THE STUDENTS' BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS ARE EXAMINED IN THE REPORT. (AF)",

MANY OF THE CHILDREN HAD NOT ATTENDED SCHOOLS FOR 4 YEARS FOLLOWING THE CLOSURE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND, THEREFORE, THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WAS FELT TO BE INADEQUATE FOR THESE STUDENTS. THE FREE SCHOOLS INITIATED UNGRADED CLASSES, TEAM TEACHING, AN EXPANDED AUDIOVISUAL PROGRAM, AND INCREASED SCHOOL TIME.

THE LANGUAGE MASTER, A DEVICE WHICH COMBINES WRITTEN AND AURAL PRESENTATIONS, WAS CONSIDERED TO BE VERY VALUABLE FOR TEACHING STANDARD ENGLISH TO THE MANY CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS SPEECH PROBLEMS. INSERVICE TRAINING IN THE USE OF AUDIOVISUAL MEDIA WAS PROVIDED. OTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE  FREE SCHOOLS PROGRAM WERE FIELD TRIPS, A SUMMER SCHOOL, AND FILMS AND CULTURAL EVENTS FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

A HAWTHORNE EFFECT IS CREATED IN THE GHETTO SCHOOL BY THE VERY PROCESS OF INITIATING AN  INNOVATIVE PROGRAM, AND THUS THE SELF-IMAGE OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL IS IMPROVED. IT IS ALSO NOW BECOMING RECOGNIZED THAT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LEVEL TO BEGIN EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION. AND BECAUSE INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES MAY HAVE WIDESPREAD APPLICABILITY, MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS OF INFORMATION DIFFUSION ARE NEEDED.

PHASE A WAS A SCHOOL LEADERSHIP PROGRAM PROVIDING INSERVICE TRAINING FOR PRINCIPALS, GUIDANCE COUNSELORS, CURRICULUM ASSISTANTS, AND TEACHERS. EVALUATION OF THIS PHASE WAS BASED ON THE FLORIDA SCALE OF CIVIC BELIEFS, ASSESSMENTS OF EIGHT INSERVICE CONFERENCE SESSIONS, AND RESPONSES TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE. PHASE B WAS AN EDUCATIONAL TEAM PROGRAM IN CERTAIN PILOT SCHOOLS IN WHICH SERVICES OF GUIDANCE AND READING SPECIALISTS AND SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS WERE PROVIDED. THIS ASPECT OF THE PROJECT WAS EVALUATED BY ANOTHER CIVIL RIGHTS QUESTIONNAIRE, BY MINORITY GROUP ATTENDANCE PATTERNS, AND BY TEACHER  RATINGS OF SPECIAL WORKSHOPS IN COMMUNICATION SKILLS FOR NEGRO STUDENTS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ONLY INDIRECT EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE AS TO THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF PHASE A IN ACHIEVING ITS GOALS.

WHEN NEGROES WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD THE FREE-CHOICE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION SYSTEM IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE ISSUE WAS NOT OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO PARENTS. MANY OF THEM DID NOT FEEL THEY REALLY HAD AN OPTION. MOREOVER, 96 PERCENT OF THE PARENTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE  SCHOOLS THEIR CHILDREN WERE CURRENTLY ATTENDING AND DID NOT HAVE ANY STRONG MOTIVATION TO TRANSFER THEM TO A WHITE SCHOOL.

THUS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POOR ARISE FROM THE EXIGENCIES OF BEING RELATIVELY WITHOUT RESOURCES AND OF BEING NEGATIVELY EVALUATED BY THE LARGER SOCIETY. THE POOR MAINTAIN THEIR CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCES BECAUSE THEY EXIST AT THE BOTTOM OF AN \"IMMUTABLE\" SOCIAL STRATIFICATION SYSTEM CREATED BY A SOCIETY WHICH STIGMATIZES ITS MEMBERS TO THE DEGREE THEY FAIL TO ACHIEVE. POLICY MAKERS SHOULD CONSIDER WAYS TO REMOVE STIGMATIZING  PROCESSES IN THE OCCUPATIONAL SYSTEM AND IN THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES OF MAJOR INSTITUTIONS, AND TO PROVIDE A GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME AND SELF-RESPECT FOR EVERYONE IN THE SOCIETY.

        "description":"THIS STUDY SOUGHT (1) TO CLARIFY THE TERM &quot;LANGUAGE APTITUDE,&quot; (2) TO BETTER DEFINE ITS RELATIONSHIP TO INTELLIGENCE, AND (3) TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF SOCIOECONOMIC LEVEL IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. SUBJECTS WERE SIXTH-GRADE PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS, 93 OF WHOM WERE MIDDLE CLASS AND 39 LOWER CLASS. SOCIAL CLASS WAS DETERMINED BY THE OTIS DUDLEY DUNCAN SOCIOECONOMIC INDEX. LANGUAGE APTITUDE WAS MEASURED BY THE MODERN LANGUAGE APTITUDE TEST (LONG FORM), AND INTELLIGENCE WAS ASSESSED BY THE COOPERATIVE SCHOOL AND COLLEGE ABILITY TESTS. FINDINGS SHOW THAT LANGUAGE APTITUDE &quot;IS NOT A UNIFIED DIMENSION OF THE COGNITIVE DOMAIN AS IS INTELLIGENCE.&quot; HOWEVER, SUBJECTS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS USE DIFFERENT PROCESSES IN THINKING ABOUT LANGUAGE. MIDDLE-CLASS CHILDREN TEND TO APPROACH ALL  TASKS INVOLVING INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG MEANING, SOUND, AND SYMBOLS IN THE SAME WAY BUT TO USE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SENTENCE STRUCTURE. LOWER-CLASS CHILDREN APPEAR TO USE DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR TASKS INVOLVING STRUCTURAL RELATIONS, SOUND-SYMBOL MEANING RELATIONS, AND SYMBOL RECOGNITION. THE EXPLANATION FOR THESE DIVERGENT APPROACHES LIES IN THE FACT THAT LOWER-CLASS CHILDREN USUALLY USE TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES--&quot;PUBLIC&quot; FOR HOME AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND &quot;FORMAL&quot; FOR SCHOOL. SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN THE TWO LANGUAGES MAY DEVELOP, OR DIFFERENT SETS OF REFERENTIAL MEANINGS MAY BE USED FOR THE LANGUAGE LEARNED AT SCHOOL.

THE HIGH SES SUBJECTS ATTENDED A UNIVERSITY SCHOOL IN AN UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS SUBURB, AND AT LEAST ONE OF THEIR PARENTS HAD ATTENDED COLLEGE. THE LOW SES SUBJECTS WERE IN A COMPLETELY NEGRO SUBURBAN PUBLIC SCHOOL AND THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THEIR FATHERS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE NO MORE THAN HIGH SCHOOL. THE SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO PERFORM TEST TASKS WHICH MEASURED AUDITORY MEMORY AT FOUR LEVELS OF VERBAL STRUCTURE--NONSENSE SYLLABLES, NOUNS, NONSENSE SENTENCES, AND MEANINGFUL SENTENCES. RESPONSES WERE RECORDED ON TAPE AND SCORED AS AN IMMEDIATE MEMORY SPAN TASK. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SHOWED THAT AUDITORY MEMORY IS GREATER AS LANGUAGE  SKILL SUPPLEMENTS MEMORY CAPACITY, AND THAT OLDER CHILDREN REMEMBER MORE UNITS THAN DO YOUNGER ONES. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN TASK LEVEL AND GRADE LEVEL, NOR BETWEEN SES AND TASK LEVEL. FINALLY, NO CUMULATIVE DEFICIT WAS FOUND WHEN THE INTERACTION OF AGE, TASK LEVEL, AND SES WAS ANALYZED.

A REVIEW OF THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN THE PROJECT SHOWS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS--A PRE-TRAINING REMEDIAL READING PROGRAM, AND A POST-TRAINING SUPERVISED SETTING IN WHICH GRADUATES MAY RECEIVE GUIDANCE IN PRACTICING DESIRABLE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO  PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES AND TO HAVE STAFF MEMBERS RECEIVE INSERVICE TRAINING IN GROUP DYNAMICS AND GROUP COUNSELING TO BETTER GUIDE TRAINEES IN PERSONAL-SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

A SAMPLE OF 500 PERSONS, CLASSIFIED INTO EIGHT CATEGORIES ON THE BASIS OF A PREVIOUS MANPOWER AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING ACT (MDTA) STUDY (VT 002 654), WAS INTERVIEWED BY USE OF SIX INSTRUMENTS DEVELOPED FOR THIS STUDY WHICH MEASURED (1) MOTIVE TO WORK, (2) EXPECTANCY TO WORK, (3) INCENTIVE TO WORK, (4) MOTIVE TO AVOID WORK, (5) EXPECTANCY TO AVOID WORK, AND (6) INCENTIVE TO AVOID WORK. SCORES FROM THE FIRST THREE INSTRUMENTS WERE MULTIPLIED TO FORM A MATHEMATICAL PRODUCT, &quot;MOTIVATION TO WORK,&quot; AND SCORES FROM THE SECOND THREE  INSTRUMENTS WERE MULTIPLIED TO FORM A MATHEMATICAL PRODUCT, &quot;MOTIVATION TO AVOID WORK.&quot; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE MATHEMATICAL PRODUCTS WAS &quot;RESIDUAL BEHAVIOR-POTENTIAL TO WORK.&quot; SOME FINDINGS WERE--(1) AMONG THOSE WHO HAD COMPLETED MDTA TRAINING, THERE WERE LOWER PROPORTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH MOTIVE TO WORK AND HIGHER PROPORTIONS WITH HIGH MOTIVE TO AVOID WORK, (2) THE EMPLOYED TENDED TO SCORE RELATIVELY HIGH ON MOTIVE TO WORK AND EXPECTANCY TO WORK, AND LOW ON MOTIVE TO AVOID WORK, EXPECTANCY TO AVOID WORK, AND INCENTIVE TO AVOID WORK, AND RELATIVELY LOW ON INCENTIVE TO WORK. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE BEHAVIOR-POTENTIAL TO WORK MEASURE DID SHOW SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS, THOUGH OF SMALL SIZE, WITH THOSE VARIABLES WHICH COMMON SENSE SUGGESTS ARE RELATED TO MOTIVATION TO WORK,  AND THAT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS RAN IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION.

Survey questionnaires to be used with students, dropouts, employees, employers, secondary school vocational programs, community college vocational  programs, and proprietary schools were developed, field tested, analyzed, and modified. A two-dimensional clustering system which combined worker functions and processes was developed, jobs in occupational areas representing mechanical, electrical, and symbolic skills were used as samples in developing task descriptions and numerical loadings from which clusters were formed. Guidelines were prepared for administering data gathering instruments and employing the clustering system. Included are: (1) detailed descriptions of instrument development, (2) a bibliography, and (3) extensive appendixes containing related information, an instrument analysis, the guide for administering instruments, the instruments, a supplement to instrument utilization, task descriptions, and classification  loadings.

NEW PURPOSES WERE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE FOR BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THE ORGANIZATION TO INCLUDE ACTIVITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE CLASSES. SOME  CONCLUSIONS WERE--(1) THERE SHOULD BE ONLY ONE ORGANIZATION FOR VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE STUDENTS, (2) THE SCOPE OF THE FFA SHOULD BE BROADENED BY ADDING ACTIVITIES APPROPRIATE FOR STUDENTS ENGAGED IN OFF-FARM INSTRUCTION, (3) THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED AT THE TIME BUT A CHANGING PROGRAM SUGGESTS CONTINUED STUDY OF THE MATTER, (4) GIRLS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR MEMBERSHIP, (5) THE TERM &quot;FARMING&quot; SHOULD BE BROADENED BY THE USE OF THE TERM AGRICULTURE, (6) LEADERSHIP ACTIVITIES AND PUBLIC SPEAKING SHOULD BE CONTINUED AT ALL LEVELS, AND (7) GENERAL LIVESTOCK AND DAIRY CATTLE JUDGING SHOULD BE RETAINED BUT CONTINUED JUDGING OF MEAT, POULTRY, EGGS, AND DAIRY PRODUCTS IS QUESTIONABLE.

DIFFERENCES IN PERCEPTIONS WERE CATEGORIZED BY RACE, SEX, INTELLIGENCE, AND RESIDENCE. VARIABLES INCLUDED SOURCES OF INFLUENCE UPON OCCUPATIONAL OR EDUCATIONAL DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY THE ATTITUDE OF THE MOTHER, ATTITUDE OF THE FATHER, AND INFLUENCE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. THOUGH MOST STUDENTS PERCEIVED OCCUPATIONAL CHOICE AS THEIR OWN, PARENTS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT EXTERNAL SOURCE OF INFLUENCE, ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE OF LOWER INTELLIGENCE. THE MOST FREQUENTLY  MENTIONED EXTRA-FAMILIAL SOURCE OF INFLUENCE UPON OCCUPATIONAL DECISIONS WAS THE TEACHER. NEGROES WERE INFLUENCED MORE BY THE MOTHER, AS WERE FEMALES OF BOTH RACES. RESIDENTIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WERE SLIGHT. HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION WAS PERCEIVED AS HAVING AN IMPORTANT EFFECT IN OCCUPATIONAL DECISIONS WITH THE DEGREE OF INFLUENCE VARYING AMONG THE CATEGORIES. STUDENTS ALSO PERCEIVED EDUCATIONAL DECISIONS TO BE THEIR OWN WITH THE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED EXTERNAL INFLUENCE BEING THE MOTHER.

THE 32 STUDIES REPORTED ANALYSES OF THE RECORDS OF MORE THAN 17,800 STUDENTS IN 20 STATES. ALTHOUGH THE CRITERIA FOR COLLEGE SUCCESS VARIED AMONG THE STUDIES, 53.8 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE GROUP DID BETTER THAN THE NONVOCATIONAL GROUP, 36.6 PERCENT SHOWED THAT THEY DID AS WELL, AND ONLY 9.6  PERCENT SHOWED THAT THEY DID POORER THAN THE NONVOCATIONAL GROUP. AS A GROUP, VOCATIONAL STUDENTS APPEARED TO DO EITHER AS WELL AS OR BETTER THAN DID NONVOCATIONAL STUDENTS IN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES. VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE APPEARED TO BE EQUAL TO OTHER HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS AS PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE WITH LITTLE BASIS FOR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE.

THE MIGRATION OF MALES WAS MORE CLEARLY CONNECTED TO VARIOUS DIFFERENTIAL FACTORS THAN THAT OF FEMALES. FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO A RESPONDENT'S MIGRATION WERE FAMILY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, FATHER'S  EDUCATION, AND WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER RESPONDENTS, A HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM INCLUDING FEWER VOCATIONAL MAJORS, A HIGHER APTITUDE, AND A LESSER IDENTIFICATION WITH THE COMMUNITY. THE EDUCATION OF THE MOTHER, RESIDENTIAL BACKGROUND, AND SCHOOL SIZE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO MIGRATION.

A REVIEW OF SELECTED \"STRUCTURAL\" ASPECTS OF EMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS GAVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON EMPLOYMENT WHEN CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN, NOT TO THE AMOUNT OF LABOR DEMANDED, BUT TO THE QUALITY OF LABOR THAT MUST BE SUPPLIED. SO LONG AS PARITY IS PRESERVED BETWEEN THE TOTAL OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND THE NUMBER IN THE LABOR FORCE, UNEMPLOYMENT REFLECTS THE PROBLEM OF MATCHING THE SPECIFIC QUALITIES OF LABOR DEMAND WITH THE SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF LABOR SUPPLY. THIS MATCHING PROCESS IS IMPEDED BY AN ACCELERATION IN THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGY AND A \"GESTATION\" BARRIER, REPRESENTED BY THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED TO  DEVELOP SKILLS DEMANDED. A SECOND MAJOR POINT OF THE STUDY WAS THAT AUTOMATION INVOLVES NOT ONLY SKILL-UPGRADING BUT SKILL-DOWNGRADING AS WELL, SINCE MANY JOB FUNCTIONS ARE \"DILUTED\" TO ADJUST TO CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. THE SKILL IMPACT OF AUTOMATION IS TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF A SMALL NUMBER OF SKILLED WORKERS WHILE DECREASING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF A LARGER NUMBER OF LESS-SKILLED WORKERS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE SUGGESTED FINDINGS WERE RELATED TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMING, WAGE POLICIES, RECRUITMENT, TURNOVER, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF MANPOWER POLICY.

TECHNICAL SCHOOLS INCLUDE TRADE- AND TECHNICIAN-ORIENTED PROGRAMS UNDER THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION. A NEW UNIVERSITY OF MALAWI INCLUDES NO COURSES OF A TECHNICAL NATURE, BUT A POLYTECHNIC AT BLANTYRE INCLUDES COURSES IN BUILDING AND ENGINEERING, MOTOR VEHICLE MECHANICS, ELECTRICAL TECHNICIAN WORK, PRINTING, CARPENTRY, JOINERY, BRICKWORK, FITTING, TURNING, AND DAY RELEASE CITY AND GUILDS COURSES. THERE ARE TWO GOVERNMENT TRADE SCHOOLS. SECONDARY TECHNICAL TEACHERS ARE BEING TRAINED IN A PILOT PROGRAM, BUT A LACK OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS FOR TEACHER EDUCATION IS A MAJOR DIFFICULTY. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN  INTRODUCED TO PROVIDE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH PLANS TO TRAIN IN 22 TRADES. GRADUAL ON-THE-JOB UPGRADING IS COMMON, BUT NO DELIBERATE GOVERNMENT EFFORT HAS YET BEEN MADE TO PROMOTE THIS ACTIVITY. PLANNING FOR VOCATIONAL TRAINING TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE THE SUPPLY OF TRAINED PERSONNEL INCLUDE DEVELOPING THE MALAWI POLYTECHNIC, GOVERNMENT TRADE SCHOOLS, AND AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. (JM)",

AN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE ADJUSTMENT DEMANDS IMPOSED BY TECHNOLOGY CANNOT BE DELAYED UNTIL SUFFICIENT REFINEMENT OF RESEARCH TECHNIQUES ENABLES THE CONSEQUENCES OF AUTOMATION TO BE CLEARLY AND PRECISELY DEFINED. SINCE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A TECHNICAL CHANGE IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY ITS \"SPAN\" OF APPLICATION, THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS ONE LIKELY TO AFFECT THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. TECHNICAL CHANGE MUST BE ANALYZED IN TERMS OF THE FACTOR SAVINGS INVOLVED, THAT IS, IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT  ON UNIT CAPITAL AND LABOR REQUIREMENTS. THIS APPROACH WOULD REQUIRE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUANTITY, FORM DISTRIBUTION, AND COST OF CAPITAL. ALTHOUGH MEASURES OF MANPOWER, STATISTICALLY SPEAKING, ARE MORE ADEQUATE, MORE ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO DIRECT LABOR-SAVING INDIRECT LABOR-USING IMPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY. ATTENTION MUST ALSO BE GIVEN TO THE RESPONSES OF THE MARKET TO AUTOMATION'S SPEED OF PENETRATION. THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF AUTOMATION WHICH CAN BE ANALYZED ARE CAPITAL AND LABOR SAVINGS, ALTERATIONS IN THE RATIO OF LABOR AND CAPITAL, RATE OF CHANGE OVER TIME FOR PER-UNIT CAPITAL AND LABOR REQUIREMENTS, AND THE CHANGES OF THE DEGREE OF SUBSTITUTABILITY OF LABOR AND CAPITAL INVOLVED WITH THE TECHNOLOGY.

COMPREHENSIVE STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 600 YOUNG HOMEMAKERS SELECTED BY STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING FROM PROTOTYPE COMMUNITIES. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS COMPLETED BY THE HOMEMAKER AT TIME OF THE INTERVIEW, AND ONE WAS LEFT FOR THE HUSBAND TO FILL OUT. FINAL DATA WERE BASED ON 594 USABLE INTERVIEW RECORDS AND QUESTIONNAIRES RETURNED BY 70 PERCENT OF THE HUSBANDS. THE CLASS DIVISIONS WERE BASED ON THOSE DEVELOPED IN A PRIOR STUDY. DEMOGRAPHICALLY, A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN SOCIAL CLASS AND MARITAL  STABILITY, LIMITATION OF FAMILY SIZE, EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF SPOUSES, FAMILY INCOME AND HOME OWNERSHIP, THE HUSBAND'S HOURS OF WORK, THE ACHIEVEMENT OF UPWARD MOBILITY, CAUCASIAN ETHNIC BACKGROUND, AND PROTESTANT RELIGIOUS PREFERENCES. ETHNIC BACKGROUND WAS RELATED TO FAMILY STRUCTURE--NEGRO FAMILIES WERE LARGE AND HIGHLY UNSTABLE, BUT THE ORIENTAL FAMILY WAS SMALL AND HIGHLY STABLE. A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN SOCIAL CLASS AND ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF FAMILY TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF THE FAMILY WERE RELATED TO SOCIAL CLASS. HIGHER CLASS FAMILIES COMMUNICATED, EMPATHIZED, AND ENCOUNTERED LESS CONFLICT THAN LOWER CLASS FAMILIES. VALUES AND ATTITUDES WERE RELATED TO SOCIAL CLASS. THE HIGHER THE SOCIAL CLASS THE MORE LIKELY IT WAS TO BE  NONAUTHORITARIAN, NONTRADITIONAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND EQUALITARIAN.

THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING ACT OF 1964 GIVES THE MINISTER OF LABOR POWER TO ESTABLISH INDUSTRIAL TRAINING BOARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE AS HE THINKS NECESSARY. THE INCORPORATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL APPROACH INTO THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING ACT INDICATED THAT WHILE THE GOVERNMENT PLANNED TO ACCEPT FAR MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRAINING, IT DID NOT INTEND TO REMOVE THE FOCAL POINT OF TRAINING FROM INDUSTRY. THE DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING BOARDS ARE (1) TO PROVIDE OR SECURE THE PROVISION OF SUFFICIENT  TRAINING FACILITIES FOR EMPLOYEES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDUSTRY, (2) TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE NATURE, LENGTH, STANDARD, CONTENT, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF TRAINING, (3) TO PAY GRANTS TO EMPLOYERS PROVIDING TRAINING OF AN APPROVED STANDARD, AND (4) TO IMPOSE A LEVY ON EMPLOYERS IN THEIR INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE TRAINING PROGRAM. THE JOB OF IMPLEMENTING THE ACT HAS PROVEN TO BE A DIFFICULT AND LENGTHY ONE. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THE ACT ACCEPTS THE HISTORICAL DICHOTOMY BETWEEN EDUCATION AND TRAINING, THERE IS A DANGER THAT IT MAY PERPETUATE OR EVEN SHARPEN THE DISTINCTION AT A TIME WHEN THAT DISTINCTION IS BECOMING LESS MEANINGFUL.

AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPOSED OF 392 ENROLLEES WHOSE NYC EXPERIENCE WAS A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AND A CONTROL GROUP COMPOSED OF 205 SIMILAR YOUTHS WHO HAD NOT ENROLLED IN NYC WERE INTERVIEWED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON NYC RECRUITMENT, WORK ASSIGNMENTS AND THEIR VALUE, LENGTH OF EXPERIENCE, SUPERVISION, FRIENDLINESS OF FELLOW-WORKERS, COUNSELORS, USEFUL AND DISLIKED ASPECTS OF EXPERIENCE, AND JOB PLACEMENT. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS WERE--(1) THE PROGRAM IS REACHING SERIOUSLY DISADVANTAGED YOUTH, (2) ENROLLEES REPORTED A HIGH LEVEL OF SATISFACTION WITH THEIR  NYC EXPERIENCE, (3) THE COMMUNITY AND WORK ADJUSTMENT OF ENROLLEES WAS IMPROVED ON SEVERAL MEASURES, AND (4) FEMALE ENROLLEES MADE GREATER GAINS THAN MALES. SOME PROBLEM AREAS CONCERNED THE PROGRAMS' LESSER EFFECTIVENESS WITH MALES AND WHITE FEMALES THAN WITH NEGRO FEMALES AND THE CONTINUING HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF EX-ENROLLEES WHICH WAS PROBABLY RELATED TO THE CHARACTER OF NYC WORK ASSIGNMENTS. ISSUES NEEDING FURTHER EXPLORATION INCLUDED JOB DEVELOPMENT, RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER MANPOWER PROGRAMS, REMEDIAL EDUCATION, FOLLOWUP COUNSELING, AND DIFFERENTIAL ENROLLEE NEEDS.

THE PRINCIPAL INFLUENCES UPON EMPLOYMENT SUCCESS WERE HIGH SCHOOL WORK AND EDUCATORS. VOCATIONAL GRADUATES AND NONVOCATIONAL GRADUATES WHO HAD TAKEN JOB-RELATED COURSES WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL. SOCIOECONOMIC CLASS DID NOT AFFECT  SUCCESS LEVEL. NEGRO FEMALES WERE LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHER FEMALES BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN SUCCESS LEVEL AMONG SPANISH, NEGRO, AND CAUCASIAN MALES.

VOCATIONAL GRADUATES OBTAINED JOBS MORE QUICKLY THAN NONCOLLEGE-BOUND ACADEMIC GRADUATES. THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE WELL-PREPARED FOR THEIR CHOSEN OCCUPATION, AND THEIR STARTING SALARIES SURPASSED THOSE OF ACADEMIC GRADUATES. THE GRADUATES WHO ENTERED THE SAME OR A HIGHLY RELATED JOB FOR WHICH THEY RECEIVED TRAINING WERE MORE SATISFIED WITH THEIR JOBS THAN GRADUATES IN SLIGHTLY RELATED OR UNRELATED JOBS.

TRAINEES ARE EMPLOYED ON A PART-TIME BASIS DURING THE TRAINING PERIOD BY THE POLICE, HEALTH AND WELFARE, INSPECTION, AND HOUSING AND RELOCATION DEPARTMENTS. IN PHASE 1, THE TRAINEES ARE TRAINED TO PERFORM USEFUL ELEMENTARY TASKS ON THE JOB FOR A 4-WEEK PRESERVICE PERIOD. THEY ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO LEARN THE NECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS RELATED TO THEIR JOB AND TO ACQUIRE A BROAD PICTURE OF THE AGENCY, ITS TRADITIONS, REGULATIONS, AND STRUCTURE. PHASE 2 CONSISTS OF A 4-WEEK TRANSITION PERIOD DURING WHICH THE TRAINEE WORKS  ONE-HALF OF EACH DAY AND DEVOTES THE OTHER HALF TO DISCUSSING HIS ON-THE-JOB EXPERIENCES AND PROBLEMS. IN PHASE 3, THE TRAINEE RECEIVES SPECIAL TRAINING 1 DAY PER WEEK IN ADDITION TO DAILY SUPERVISION ON THE JOB FOR THE BALANCE OF THE 2-YEAR PROGRAM TO ACQUIRE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR HIS UPGRADING--SUCH AS LITERACY, RECORD KEEPING OR HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR COLLEGE COURSES. THIS APPROACH WILL ALLOW FOR GENUINE CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TRAINEE WHILE EMPLOYED AT NO LESS THAN $3600 PER YEAR. STAFFING INCLUDES ONE TRAINING DIRECTOR, ONE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, ONE SENIOR TRAINER RECRUITED FROM EACH AGENCY, AND FOUR TO EIGHT ASSISTANT TRAINERS FROM OUTSIDE THE AGENCIES. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROGRAM DESIGN BE SIMPLE AND TASK ORIENTED, THAT A MAJORITY OF THE BASIC STAFF BE COMPOSED OF ASSISTANT  TRAINERS, AND THAT CLOSE CONTACT BE DEVELOPED WITH THE AGENCIES EMPLOYING THE TRAINEES.

TECHNOLOGY IS A MAJOR AMERICAN SOCIETAL BASE INVOLVING PRACTICALLY ALL CITIZENS AND SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AS A DISCIPLINE TO ELIMINATE CONFUSION AND LACK OF DIRECTION IN THE CURRICULUM. A MACROTECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS IDENTIFYING A UNIVERSE OF CONTENT WHICH IS IN KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF DISCIPLINE STRUCTURES AND GENERAL EDUCATION IS OFFERED AS A MEANS OF DEFINING A TAXONOMY TO SERVE CURRICULUM PLANNING. A TAXONOMY OF TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS OF BOTH TECHNICAL AND CULTURAL-SOCIAL ELEMENTS WITH THE MAJOR TECHNICAL AREAS BEING PRODUCTION, COMMUNICATION, AND TRANSPORTATION WHICH MEET TAXONOMETRIC SELECTION CRITERIA INCLUDING THAT OF UNIVERSALISM. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES INDICATE  10 LEVELS OF SPECIFICITY IN THE PROPOSED TAXONOMY. MAJOR STEPS IN CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, UTILIZING THE TAXONOMY AS A CONTEXT RESERVOIR, ARE TO ESTABLISH THE TAXONOMY, THE BASIC CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES, UNITS OF CONTENT INSTRUCTION BASED ON ANALYSES OF CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES, AND COURSES OF STUDY BY GROUPING LOGICAL COMBINATIONS OF INSTRUCTIONAL UNITS. SOME ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH ARE THAT (1) CONTENT SELECTION CRITERIA ARE PROVIDED, (2) FLEXIBILITY, ADATABILITY, AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY ARE INTRINSIC, (3) PROGRAMS RATHER THAN ISOLATED COURSES ARE POSSIBLE, (4) TEACHER COMPETENCY CAN BE INCREASED THROUGH SPECIALIZATION, AND (5) A BASE IS PROVIDED FOR LIFETIME STUDY AND PROFESSIONAL CONTRIBUTION BY TEACHERS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROFESSION, THROUGH THE AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL ARTS  ASSOCIATION, ESTABLISH A PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR DERIVING A TAXONOMETRIC STRUCTURE FOR THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS.

EDUCATIONAL NEEDS WERE DETERMINED THROUGH A REVIEW OF LITERATURE, A SURVEY OF EXISTING SPECIALIZED SECRETARIAL TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND OBSERVATIONS, INTERVIEWS AND A QUESTIONNAIRE STUDY OF PERSONNEL IN 118 SCIENCE-RELATED ORGANIZATIONS IN 25 DIFFERENT STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. A PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM FOR 46  TRAINEES, CONSISTING OF 320 CLOCK-HOURS OF INSTRUCTION, BASED ON CRUCIAL TASKS IDENTIFIED IN THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AND EVALUATED. IT WAS FOUND THAT SCIENTIFIC SECRETARIES HAVE SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS FOR DEVELOPING KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN BASIC GENERAL SCIENCE, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY, MATHEMATICS, TECHNICAL TYPING (EQUATIONS, SYMBOLS, AND FORMULAS), AND TECHNICAL SHORTHAND. THE TRAINEES ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL ON 16 OF 20 PRE- AND POST-TEST MEASURES (.05 LEVEL) AS A RESULT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE IN THE PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM.

DATA FROM VARIOUS SOURCES INDICATE THAT ERIC HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ATTAINING ITS FOUR MAJOR OBJECTIVES--(1) TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT, BUT PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE R/D REPORTS EASILY AND READILY AVAILABLE TO EDUCATORS, (2) TO INTERPRET AND SUMMARIZE RESULTS IN WAYS THAT EDUCATIONAL PRACTITIONERS AND DECISION-MAKERS CAN USE THEM, (3) TO HELP STRENGTHEN EXISTING COMMUNICATION CHANNELS IN EDUCATION, AND (4) TO BECOME AN IMPORTANT BASE FOR DEVELOPING A NATIONAL EDUCATION INFORMATION NETWORK. ERIC IS A VIGOROUS PROGRAM, EVEN THOUGH IN ITS INFANCY. SALES DATA FOR RIE AND FOR DOCUMENTS FROM EDRS INDICATE  THAT THE RESPONSE FROM THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY IS ONLY AT THE TAKE-OFF POINT. ADDITIONAL DATA ARE NEEDED ON THE COST- EFFECTIVENESS OR TRADE-OFF VALUES OF DIFFERENT CLEARINGHOUSE ACTIVITIES. THIS AVENUE IS BEING PURSUED AND MORE REFINED EVALUATION DATA ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ERIC OPERATIONS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 1968. APPENDIXES GIVE DATA ON RIE SUBSCRIBERS AND CLEARINGHOUSE PUBLICATIONS. ED 020 450 IS A RELATED DOCUMENT, AN OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF ERIC AND SOME OF ITS MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO DATE.

IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE VALUES OF THE DECENTRALIZED PLAN OF OPERATION ARE DEMONSTRATED IN THE GROWING TIES AMONG CLEARINGHOUSE AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND BY THE INCREASING NUMBER OF INFORMATION ANALYSIS PRODUCTS GENERATED BY THE CLEARINGHOUSES. THE HISTORY OF ERIC FALLS IN THREE STAGES, WITH THE FIRST STAGE INVOLVING ESTABLISHMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF THE INTERNAL ERIC SYSTEM. DURING THE PAST YEAR THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE BECOME ROUTINIZED AND THE CLEARINGHOUSES HAVE BEGUN TO INCREASE INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND RELATED DISSEMINATION PROGRAMS.  THIS STAGE IS ALSO WELL ESTABLISHED AND THE ERIC SYSTEM IS NOW REACHING ITS MATURE LEVEL OF OPERATION, WITH MORE ATTENTION BEING DEVOTED TO LINKING ERIC TO OTHER DISSEMINATION CHANNELS AND TO ENCOURAGING LOCAL, STATE, COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ORGANIZATIONS TO USE ERIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

USING THE SAUSSUREAN MODEL OF THE LINGUISTIC SIGN, A DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN \"COORDINATE\" AND \"COMPOUND\" BILINGUALS. COMPOUND BILINGUALISM TENDS TO RESULT WHEN THE TWO LANGUAGES ARE ACQUIRED IN A SPEECH COMMUNITY OFFERING THE CHILD EQUAL AND SIMULTANEOUS EXPOSURE TO THE TWO LANGUAGES AND WHERE THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE TWO LANGUAGES ARE MINIMALLY DIFFERENTIATED. THE MORE TYPICAL BILINGUAL SITUATION IS ONE IN WHICH ONE OF THE LANGUAGES IS SOCIOLOGICALLY DOMINANT AND IN WHICH THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE TWO LANGUAGES ARE DIFFERENT. WHEN BILINGUALS ARE  STUDIED IN CONTEXTS WHERE THEIR BILINGUAL OR BICULTURAL BACKGROUND DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN THEM LOWER STATUS WITHIN A MONOLINGUAL COMMUNITY, IT CAN BE SHOWN \"THAT BILINGUALISM IS ASSOCIATED WITH AND MAY IN FACT BE FACILITATIVE OF SIGNIFICANTLY SUPERIOR PERFORMANCES ON BOTH VERBAL AND NON-VERBAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS.\" CASES OF BILINGUAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY CAN BE TRACED TO A \"CRISIS IN SOCIAL AND PERSONAL IDENTITY ENGENDERED BY ANTAGONISTIC ACCULTURATIVE PRESSURES DIRECTED ON A BICULTURAL COMMUNITY BY A SOCIOLOGICALLY DOMINANT MONOLINGUAL SOCIETY.\" APPENDED TO THIS PAPER IS A SIX-PAGE BIBLIOGRAPHY ON BILINGUALISM.

THESE 144 SYLLABLES WERE GROUPED INTO CONTRASTING PAIRS DIFFERING ONLY IN THE INITIAL CONSONANT PHONEME. THESE CONTRASTS WERE THEN CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO EXPECTED DIFFICULTY OF DISCRIMINATION AND PRODUCTION FOR AN AMERICAN WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF RUSSIAN.

EXPERIMENT II WAS BASICALLY THE SAME AS I, WITH SLIGHT CHANGES IN THE  SELECTION OF SUBJECTS AND STIMULUS MATERIAL. A LINGUISTIC INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS INDICATES THAT--(1) AN ADDITIONAL PRESENTATION OF THE VOICED-VOICELESS CONTRASTS MIGHT RESULT IN NEARLY PERFECT IDENTIFICATION, AND THAT PEDAGOGICALLY, REPEATED TRIALS ON THE SAME CONCEPT COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN RANDOM PRESENTATION, (2) GENERALLY, FRICATIVES ARE MORE EASILY DISTINGUISHED THAN STOPS, (3) SUBJECTS HAD DIFFICULTY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN VOICED AND VOICELESS STOPS IN RUSSIAN, AND (4) MOST OF THE FINDINGS FULFILL THE EXPECTATIONS RESULTING FROM A CONTRASTING PHONEMIC ANALYSIS OF RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH.

THE CURRENT DEBATE IS BETWEEN LINGUISTS WHO SET UP SEVERAL SYNTACTIC LEVELS AND THOSE WHO SEE UNDERLYING (DEEP) STRUCTURE AS SEMANTIC. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE STRATEGY BEING USED IN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS AS BEING OF TWO TYPES. IN THE FIRST APPROACH, A SELECTED THEORY OF LANGUAGE IS ASSUMED TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND USEFUL, AND EFFORTS ARE MADE TO SIMULATE IT. IF THE THEORY SELECTED REGARDS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SURFACE AND DEEP STRUCTURE AS  TRANSFORMATIONAL, EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROGRAM SIMULATED TRANSFORMS ON THE COMPUTER.

        "description":"THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE LANGUAGE LABORATORY AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF TRUJILLO AS IT IS USED IN THE FIVE-YEAR ENGLISH TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM. THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS COURSE ARE INTENSIVE, BASED ON A STUDY OF ENGLISH USING LADO-FRIES MATERIALS (FOR LATIN AMERICAN LEARNERS) WHICH REQUIRE FIVE HOURS OF CLASSWORK A WEEK SUPPLEMENTED BY FIVE HOURS IN THE LANGUAGE LAB. CLASSES ARE SCHEDULED BY THE HOUR WITH DIFFERENT MONITORS FOR THE VARIOUS GROUPS. A REGULAR 50-MINUTE SESSION BEGINS WITH A FREE CONVERSATION WARM-UP, AFTER WHICH BOOKS AND OTHER STUDENT PARAPHERNALIA ARE REMOVED BEFORE DRILLS BEGIN. A SHORT BREAK AFTER THE FIRST 25 MINUTES (FOR ROLL CALL) IS FOLLOWED BY A SHORT LANGUAGE GAME AND FURTHER DRILLS. THE FOUR-PHASE DRILLS (WHICH ACCOMPANY THE LADO-FRIES  MATERIALS) OFFER A VARIETY OF ORAL WORK AND RANGE OF VOICES. STUDENTS ARE STRICTLY MONITORED BY A TEACHER LISTENING IN AND STRUCTURAL ERRORS AND CARELESS PRONUNCIATION ARE CORRECTED ON THE SPOT. MORE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ARE NOTED ON SLIPS AND SENT TO THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS. A PRACTICAL DISCUSSION OF THE CARE AND CATALOGING OF THE TAPES CONCLUDES THE PAPER.

SHE MAKES THE FOLLOWING CRITICISMS OF TRANSFORMATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CHILD LANGUAGE--(1) NOTHING CAN BE DIRECTLY INFERRED WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESS OF LANGUAGE ACQUISITION FROM TENTATIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE MECHANISM OF NATURAL LANGUAGE, (2) THE HUMAN BRAIN DOES NOT WORK LIKE A COMPUTER, AND (3) CONCENTRATING ON SYNTAX (THE CORNERSTONE OF TRANSFORMATIONAL RESEARCH) IN CHILD LANGUAGE ANALYSIS IS \"TOTALLY MISLEADING.\" FURTHERMORE, THE CHILD'S FIRST VERBAL EXPRESSIONS ARE DESIDERATIVES, WITH INTERROGATIVES APPEARING VERY EARLY. ACCORDING TO GENERATIVE THEORY, THE PRODUCTION  OF THESE FORMS REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE TRANSFORMATION. THE AUTHOR ALSO POINTS OUT THE CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE OF THE GENERATIVE APPROACH--(1) IT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A MORE PRECISE FORMULATION OF THE MANIFOLD PROBLEMS OF FIRST LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, (2) BY BRINGING TO LIGHT THE FRUITLESSNESS OF USING MODELS BEFORE STRUCTURING DATA, IT HAS LEFT LINGUISTS FREE TO TRY OTHER ROUTES, AND (3) IT HAS GIVEN IMPETUS TO NEW RESEARCH ON CHILD LANGUAGE.

THE AUTHOR FEELS, HOWEVER, THAT THE EFFECTS OF THIS THEORY ON LANGUAGE TEACHING HAVE BEEN NEGLIGIBLE AND THAT THE INNOVATIONS AND ADVANCES IN LANGUAGE TEACHING DURING THE PAST DECADE HAVE BEEN PEDAGOGICAL RATHER THAN LINGUISTIC. THE CONTENT OF THE TEACHING IS STILL THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AS SHAPED BY THE LINGUISTIC THEORY OF THE 1930'S AND 40'S. THE FEW APPEALS TO LANGUAGE TEACHERS HAVE HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE PREPARATION OF TEACHING MATERIALS OR ON ACTUAL CLASSROOM PRACTICE. SEVERAL REASONS ARE SUGGESTED. (1) FEW OF THE GENERATIVE  THEORETICIANS ARE ALSO LANGUAGE TEACHERS, AND ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH THEORY. (2) UNTIL NOW, THE GENERATIVE GRAMMAR OF ENGLISH HAS BEEN RELATIVELY INACCESSIBLE TO LANGUAGE TEACHERS. (3) IT HASN'T BEEN TRIED BY LANGUAGE TEACHERS SIMPLY OUT OF INERTIA.

ITS MOST IMPORTANT RAMIFICATIONS HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH INSTRUCTIONAL MEDIA OR METHODS, BUT MORE WITH DETERMINATION OF COURSE OBJECTIVES AND WITH EVALUATION OF WHETHER THE STUDENTS HAVE ACHIEVED THOSE OBJECTIVES. AN OUTSTANDING FEATURE OF THE PROCEDURE SUGGESTED HERE IS THAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGIST STARTS BUILDING HIS CURRICULUM BY PREPARING THE FINAL EXAMINATION, AND THEN BUILDS A COURSE THAT TEACHES THE STUDENT TO PASS THE  EXAMINATION. THE TEST DOES NOT MERELY SAMPLE PARTS OF THE COURSE, BUT COVERS EVERYTHING THE STUDENT MUST LEARN TO DO, AND EVERY STUDENT IS EXPECT TO GET EVERY ITEM RIGHT.

THIRTY-SIX STUDENTS FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF LATIN AMERICA WHO WERE COMPLETING A TEN-WEEK COLLEGE PREPARATORY \"ENGLISH ORIENTATION\" COURSE AT LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY SERVED AS SUBJECTS. THERE WERE THREE PARTS TO THE TEST--(1) AN ENGLISH AND A SPANISH VERSION OF A NINE-ITEM SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL TO INDEX TYPE OF BILINGUALISM, (2) A PRONUNCIATION TEST TO MEASURE THE SUBJECTS' FREEDOM FROM SPANISH PHONETIC INFLUENCES ON ENGLISH, AND (3) A LISTENING TEST TO MEASURE THE SUBJECTS' ABILITY TO PERCEIVE ENGLISH PHONES. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE HIGHER THE SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL D (DISTANCE)  SCORE, OR THE CLOSER TO COORDINATE BILINGUALISM, THE GREATER IS THE NUMBER OF BOTH PRONUNCIATION AND LISTENING ERRORS A SUBJECT IS LIKELY TO MAKE.

IN GENERAL, THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF TWO PROCESSES--(1) FORMAL, QUANTITATIVE RECORDING OF THE RATE OF BEHAVIOR UNDER STUDY AND ITS CURRENT CONTINGENCIES WITH TEACHER SUPPLIED SOCIAL STIMULATION, AND (2) EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION OF THOSE CONTINGENCIES. NOT ONLY DID BEHAVIOR CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO REINFORCEMENT, BUT IF THE TEACHER INTRODUCED A SUBJECT TO THE COMMUNITY OF MUTUAL REINFORCEMENT CONTINGENCIES AND LEFT HIM IN IT TOO LONG, THE TEACHER WAS UNABLE TO EXTRACT HIM AGAIN. THIS PROCESS WAS  DEFINED AS TRAPPING A CHILD WITHIN THE PEER GROUP. THE ESSENCE OF THE TRAP WAS THAT ONLY A RELATIVELY SIMPLE RESPONSE IS NECESSARY TO ENTER THE TRAP. ONCE ENTERED, THE TRAP CANNOT BE RESISTED IN CREATING GENERAL BEHAVIOR CHANGE. A CHILD BECOMES TRAPPED BY PROMPTING SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WHICH REINFORCES HIM EACH TIME HE DISPLAYS IT, UNTIL HE ENTERS THE SOCIAL TRAP OF THE PEER GROUP.

A RESEARCH PARADIGM IS PRESENTED FOR STUDYING THE PROCESSES BY WHICH ANXIETY INTERRUPTS INTELLECTIVE ACTIVITY AND FOR EXAMINING WAYS IN WHICH ENVIRONMENTS MAY BE RECONSTRUCTED SO THAT DISRUPTION DOES NOT OCCUR. THIS  PARADIGM CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION ON WAYS IN WHICH LEARNING ENVIORNMENTS CAN BE MODIFIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACILITATING EFFECTS OF ANXIETY AND TO ELIMINATE ITS DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS.

        "description":"WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL IS VIEWED AS A SOCIAL SYSTEM, PUPIL CONTROL IS THE THREAD RUNNING THROUGHOUT SCHOOL CULTURE. THE PART OF THIS SOCIAL SYSTEM MOST CONCERNED WITH CONTROL AND EMPHASIZED IN THIS STUDY IS THE TEACHER SUBCULTURE. SINCE STATUS IN THE TEACHER SUBCULTURE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO CLASS CONTROL, PERSONNEL WHO FIND THEIR STATUS MOST THREATENED WILL PROBABLY BE MOST CONTROL-ORIENTED. A STUDY OF 1,306 EDUCATORS (468 ELEMENTARY AND 477 SECONDARY TEACHERS, 84 ELEMENTARY AND 97 SECONDARY PRINCIPALS, AND 180 COUNSELORS) SUBSTANTIATES THIS HYPOTHESIS. ELEMENTARY TEACHERS ARE LESS CONCERNED WITH CONTROL THAN SECONDARY TEACHERS (SMALLER CHILDREN PRESENT LESS THREAT TO STATUS), PRINCIPALS ARE LESS CONTROL-ORIENTED THAN TEACHERS (THEIR STATUS IS LESS THREATENED), AND COUNSELORS  ARE LESS RIGID CONCERNING CONTROL THAN TEACHERS (THEIR STATUS IS NOT THREATENED). RELATED FINDINGS SHOW THAT EDUCATORS WITH MORE DOGMATIC ATTITUDES EMPHASIZE CONTROL WHILE LONG TIME TEACHERS ARE MORE CONTROL-ORIENTED THAN TEACHERS RECENTLY FINISHING PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION. THE CONTROL ORIENTATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARISES BECAUSE THEY SERVE UNSELECTED CLIENTS WHO ARE OFTEN UNWILLING AND UNRESPONSIVE. IF SCHOOLS ARE TO BE LESS CONTROL ORIENTED, THEY WILL HAVE TO BECOME INCREASINGLY ATTRACTIVE TO STUDENTS.

        "description":"A STUDY WAS MADE IN 18 ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY DELAWARE SCHOOLS TO INVESTIGATE THE SEPARATE AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF ROLES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND PERSONALITIES ON THE ALIENATION OF TEACHERS. PERSONALITY WAS DESIGNATED AS ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE. ROLES WERE DESIGNATED AS AUTHORITARIAN-RITUALISTIC, INSTRUMENTAL, RITUALISTIC-GRATIFICATORY, AND GUIDANCE. ORGANIZATIONS WERE CLASSIFIED AS THREE R'S, OCCUPATIONAL, GROUP LOCOMOTION, AND INDIVIDUAL-DEVELOPMENT. ALL DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH QUESTIONNAIRES ADMINISTERED TO ADMINISTRATORS, STAFF, AND STUDENTS. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT NO SPECIFIC TYPE OF PERSONALITY, ROLE, OR ORGANIZATION WAS CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ALIENATION. AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IS LIKELY TO INCREASE ALIENATION, AND AN INDIVIDUAL-DEVELOPMENT SCHOOL IS LIKELY TO  DECREASE ALIENATION IN INTERACTION WITH OTHER FACETS. CERTAIN INTERACTION PATTERNS EMERGE AS MOST PREDICTIVE OF ALIENATION EFFECTS. AT TIMES, ONE TYPE OF ROLE CAN HAVE LITTLE ASSOCIATION WITH ALIENATION, BUT GIVEN AN INTERACTION WITH A CERTAIN TYPE OF SCHOOL, AN EFFECT BEGINS TO APPEAR. THE MAJOR FINDING OF THE STUDY IS THAT ROLES, PERSONALITIES, AND ORGANIZATIONS WHICH LEAN TOWARD A STUDENT FOCUS ARE LESS ALIENATION-RELATED THAN SCHOOLS WHICH CONTAIN PERSONALITY, ROLE, AND ORGANIZATION DEMANDS FOR EMPHASIS ON CONTENT.

TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY FEATURES OF THE TEACHER SUBCULTURE, A 14-MONTH FIELD STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, AND OBSERVATIONS OF TEACHER SOCIALIZATION AND PUPIL CONTROL WERE COMPARED FOR SCHOOLS FOLLOWING CUSTODIAL AND HUMANISTIC PUPIL CONTROL IDEOLOGIES. SUPPORTED PREDICTIONS INCLUDE--(1) TEACHERS ARE MORE CUSTODIAL IN PUPIL CONTROL THAN PRINCIPALS OR COUNSELORS, (2) SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS ARE MORE CUSTODIAL THAN THEIR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COUNTERPARTS, AND (3) INCREASED CUSTODIALISM ACCOMPANIES TEACHER SOCIALIZATION. IN ITS WIDER SOCIAL SETTING THE SCHOOL IS CONCERNED WITH COMMUNITY SUPPORT, A REPUTATION FOR INNOVATION, AND SPECIALIZATION  TO MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICT LESS BURDENSOME. WHILE CURRICULUM CHANGE IS TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS A RESPONSIBILITY OF A TEACHERS' CURRICULUM COMMITTEE, RESULTS ARE USUALLY MINIMAL BECAUSE OF THE NORMATIVE ASPECTS OF THE SCHOOL AS A SOCIAL SYSTEM. EFFECTIVE CURRICULUM CHANGE EMANATES MORE CLEARLY FROM PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SOURCES OPERATING OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM OF CONSTRAINTS THAT DETER SCHOOL PERSONNEL.

INTERVIEWS USING AN 18-ITEM BEHAVIOR RATING FORM WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE PATIENTS' FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS. CONTROL SUBJECTS WERE ALSO RATED. ADDITIONAL DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM HIGH SCHOOL RECORDS. THREE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS USED THE DATA TO EVALUATE THE EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT OF SUBJECTS AND TO RANK THE SUBJECTS BY LIKELIHOOD OF LATER NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION. THE PRESCHIZOPHRENIC AND CONTROL GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN IN HIGH SCHOOL ON CONFORMITY TO RULES, MAINTENANCE OF PERSONAL APPEARANCE, OVERT EXPRESSIONS OF HOSTILITY, OR TENDENCY TO COMPLAIN. THE PRESCHIZOPHRENIC GROUP  DIFFERED FROM THE CONTROL GROUP ON SELECTED ITEMS IN THEIR SCHOOL RECORDS--FEWER GRADUATED (.01 LEVEL), MORE ENROLLED IN THE GENERAL COURSE OF STUDY RATHER THAN THE COLLEGE PREPARATORY (.01), MORE HAD FOREIGN LANGUAGES AS BEST SUBJECTS, PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND MATHEMATICS AS POOREST (.001), FAILED ENGLISH, SOCIAL STUDIES, AND MATHEMATICS (.02), HAD AN OVERALL DECLINING GRADE PATTERN (.02), HAD A GRADE POINT AVERAGE ONE POINT LOWER (.001), HAD POORER ATTENDANCE (.02), SHOWED LESS INTEREST IN SPORTS AND DRAMATICS (.05), AND HAD LOWER IQ SCORES (.05) . THE JUDGES WERE CORRECT IN THEIR OVERALL PREDICTIONS OF LATER HOSPITALIZATION OR SATISFACTORY ADJUSTMENT IN THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR CHOICES.

        "description":"NOTING THAT RECENT RESEARCH POINTS TO LINGUISTIC CODE DIFFERENCES AS AN IMPORTANT FACET OF CULTURAL DEPRIVATION AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF EDUCABLE MENTALLY RETARDED (EMR) CHILDREN COME FROM LOW SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS, IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT ONE OF THE KEYS TO LEARNING FOR EMR CHILDREN IS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TEACHER'S LANGUAGE IN RELATION TO THAT OF THE CHILDREN AND THAT THE LINGUISTIC CODE MAY BE RELATED TO THE FAILURE OF SPECIAL CLASSES TO SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR THE STUDENT. A SYSTEM OF ANALYZING AND CODING TEACHER-PUPIL VERBAL INTERACTION WAS DEVELOPED BY USING TAPESCRIPTS FROM TWO EMR CLASSES WITH A TOTAL OF 19 CHILDREN (MEAN IQ = 117 MONTHS). TEACHERS OF BOTH CLASSES HAD BEEN SPECIAL EDUCATION MAJORS IN COLLEGE AND HAD 7 YEARS EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THEM WITH THE EMR.  DIFFERENT METHODS OF WORD ANALYSIS WERE ASSESSED. THE SYSTEM DEVELOPED HAS THREE PARTS--THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY INDEX (LCI), THE SENTENCE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, AND A CONTENT ANALYSIS. THE LCI IS A SCORING SYSTEM WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY WEIGHTS THE LENGTH OF A SENTENCE AND THE COMPLEXITY OF ITS NOUN AND VERB PHRASES. SENTENCES ARE CLASSIFIED INTO ONE OF FIVE CLASSES--SIMPLE, SIMPLE WITH A PHRASE, ELABORATED SIMPLE, COMPOUND AND COMPLEX, AND ELABORATED COMPOUND AND COMPLEX SENTENCES. THESE FIVE CLASSES FORM A LOGICAL HIERARCHY OF COMPLEXITY AND ARE DIFFERENTIALLY WEIGHTED. A SENTENCE COMPLEXITY SCORE (SCE) IS OBTAINED BY ADDING THE LCI AND THE WEIGHTED VALUE FOR THE CLASS OF SENTENCE. THE CONTENT OF A SENTENCE IS CODED ACCORDING TO THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMUNICATION INTO EIGHT CATEGORIES  GROUPED INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES (STRUCTURING, RESPONSES REQUESTED, AND REACTING) USED AS PARAMETERS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SCS. ONE FIGURE AND A 26-ITEM BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE INCLUDED. APPENDIXES PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LINGUISTIC CODING SYSTEM AND A STUDY OF THE VERBAL OUTPUT IN A SPECIAL CLASS FOR RETARDED CHILDREN.

        "description":"THE MAJOR PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS A TRIAL AND EVALUATION OF AN EXPERIMENTAL CURRICULUM UNIT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A STRUCTURAL PROGRAM IN SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND BEHAVIOR FOR EDUCABLE MENTALLY RETARDED ADOLESCENTS. THE PROGRAM WAS DEVISED IN THE FORM OF SEQUENTIAL SIMULATION OR ILLUSTRATIONS LEADING TO SKILLS IN PERCEIVING WHICH CUES ARE RELEVANT, INFERRING FROM THESE WHAT IS OCCURRING, AND DETERMINING WHAT SOCIAL RESPONSES WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE. THE 56 SUBJECTS WERE SELECTED FROM YOUNG ADOLESCENTS (AGED 13 TO 16) ENROLLED IN SIX SPECIAL CLASSES FROM THREE SCHOOLS AND WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED EITHER TO AN EXPERIMENTAL OR TO A PLACEBO GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP'S TREATMENT CONSISTED OF 48 1-HOUR LESSONS FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL CURRICULUM (PERCEPTUAL TRAINING FOR COMMUNITY  LIVING--A PREVOCATIONAL UNIT FOR RETARDED YOUTHS, THE 1965 REVISION BY EDMONDSON, LEACH, AND LELAND). THE CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED A CONVENTIONAL SPECIAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM WITH SELECTED ELEMENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT MANIPULATED. PRETEST AND POSTTEST MEASURES WERE TAKEN ON THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS--VINELAND SOCIAL MATURITY SCALE, FUDELL TEST OF OCCUPATIONAL READINESS, TEST OF SOCIAL INFERENCE, BOWN SELF-REPORT INVENTORY, AND BEHAVIOR RATING SCALE. RESULTS WERE ALSO OBTAINED ON TEACHER AND PUPIL EVALUATIONS, AND WEEKLY UNIT TESTS. THE EXPERIMENTAL VARIABLES OF CURRICULA, SCHOOLS, AND TIME WERE ANALYZED IN TERMS OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES (MEASURES OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR). ANALYSIS INDICATED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND THE PLACEBO GROUPS FOLLOWING THE TREATMENT  PERIOD. IT WAS FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT FEMALE PUPILS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER (BEYOND .025 LEVEL) THAN MALE PUPILS ON FOUR OF THE SEVEN MEASURES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACHIEVEMENT ON WEEKLY UNIT TESTS AND SCORES ON TWO POSTTEST MEASURES WAS SIGNIFICANT BEYOND THE .05 LEVEL. TEACHER AND PUPIL EVALUATIONS INDICATED GENERAL APPROVAL.

AFTER LISTING 12 MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS OF 1961, THE OUTLINE RAISES POLICY QUESTIONS AND REPORTS ON A PROPOSAL TO APPLY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY TO THESE PROBLEMS. THE DISCUSSION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IS BROKEN DOWN INTO (1) TECHNICAL ASPECTS, (2) THE PROGRAM OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION, AND (3) THE PROGRAM OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS INCLUDE PROVIDING A MULTIPLE-CHANNEL TELEVISION BROADCASTING SYSTEM AND A PRODUCTION CENTER TO FEED THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. THE OUTLINE THEN PROCEEDS TO OBJECTIVES, TECHNIQUES, MATERIALS, AND RATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION PROGRAM, AS WELL AS THE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM. THIS IS FOLLOWED  BY A DISCUSSION OF THE TRANSITION, BASIC CHANGES, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND LESSON CONSTRUCTION, TESTING PROBLEMS, AND PRODUCTION OF LOCAL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS IN THE SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

TWO ADDITIONAL VARIABLES INTENDED TO INFLUENCE RESPONSES TO THE PICTORIAL ITEMS WERE PRESENCE OF A MAN OR WOMAN AND AMOUNT OF MONEY IMPLIED IN THE DECISION SITUATION DEPICTED IN THE PICTURE. DUE TO COMPLICATIONS IN ADMINISTERING THE WRITTEN AND CINEMATIC FORMS OF THE TEST TO FRESHMEN, AND BECAUSE THE &quot;UNDECIDED&quot; RESPONSES WERE OMITTED, THE BASE FOR CORRELATIONS VARIED.

IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THE RETHINKING OF TEACHING METHODS IN THE LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITIES AFFORDED BY TELEVISION, BOTH EXPERTS AND INEXPERIENCED PERSONS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER TO EXCHANGE IDEAS AND FINDINGS. EXPERIMENTERS POINTED OUT THE DISADVANTAGES OF A PASSIVE LEARNING SITUATION FOR THE STUDENTS AND A NATURAL RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF TEACHERS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF TELEVISED INSTRUCTION. ADVANTAGES CITED, HOWEVER, ARE NUMEROUS--ALL THE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO SEE THE MONITORS WHICH IN TURN ENABLE THE DETAILS OF DEMONSTRATIONS AND GRAPHICS TO BE  SEEN EASILY, OVERFLOW CLASSES CAN BE ACCOMMODATED BY ADDITIONAL MONITORS IN SEPARATE ROOMS, AND LESSONS, WHEN CAREFULLY PREPARED WITH AN EMPHASIS ON VISUAL MATERIAL, ARE AT LEAST AS EFFECTIVE IN THEIR TEACHING AS ORDINARY CLASSROOM PROCEDURES.

MORE THAN HALF OF THE TEACHERS HAD VIEWED MORE THAN HALF OF THE PROGRAMS. TEST PERFORMANCE AND VIEWING OF THE COURSE WERE FOUND TO BE CLEARLY AND POSITIVELY RELATED. SUPERVISION OF VIEWING SESSIONS BY PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO AMOUNT OF VIEWING, AND THUS CONSTITUTED ONE MEANS OF INCREASING THE AUDIENCE. REGULAR AND FREQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER TEACHERS AFTER EACH PROGRAM RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER TEST SCORES COMPARED TO NO SUCH DISCUSSIONS. THE MOST WANTED  INSTRUCTIONAL AIDS TO ACCOMPANY TELEVISED INSTRUCTION WERE OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK QUESTIONS OF AN EXPERT OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CONFERENCE LED BY AN EXPERT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE GREATEST DEMAND IN TELEVISED INSTRUCTION TO TEACHERS IS FOR FEEDBACK. (OH)",

ANOTHER VARIABLE, NUMBER OF STEPS (NSTEPS) REQUIRED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS, WAS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO TRANSFORMATION (STEPS REQUIRED TO PUT THE EQUATION INTO CANONICAL FORM), OPERATION (NUMBER OF OPERATIONS  PERFORMED), AND MEMORY (NUMBER OF DIGITS THAT MUST BE HELD IN MEMORY). TERMINALS WERE INSTALLED IN EIGHT CLASSROOMS, AND 270 THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH GRADERS PARTICIPATED FOR ONE ACADEMIC YEAR IN COMPUTER-ASSISTED MATHEMATICS INSTRUCTION.

CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT THE NEED FOR LIBRARIANS IN THE STATE, THE RAPID EXPANSION OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND THE PROFESSIONAL CURRICULUM, AND THE URGENT NEED FOR RESEARCH RESULT IN A MAJOR NEW RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EXISTING SCHOOLS AT BERKELEY AND LOS ANGELES. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE SCHOOLS AT U.C.L.A. AND BERKELEY INCREASE THEIR ENROLLMENT QUOTAS, ENLARGE AND DIVERSIFY THEIR FACULTY, AND EXPAND THEIR PROVISION OF SPACE, WITH THE DEANS AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS ACHIEVING A CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO  THESE OBJECTIVES. IT IS ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THESE EXISTING GRADUATE SCHOOLS CANNOT MEET THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS IN CALIFORNIA, THAT OTHER UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES OFFER ACCESS TO NEW SOURCES OF GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND THAT NEW NON-CONVENTIONAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES. THEREFORE, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO NEW LIBRARY SCHOOLS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WITHIN FIVE YEARS IS RECOMMENDED.

THE DATA WERE THE CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR RESPONSES DURING THE PROGRAM SESSIONS, AS COLLECTED FROM TAPE-RECORDINGS, FILMS, RECORDED OBSERVATIONS, ARTWORK, AND WRITINGS. THE  FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE CHILDREN ALL RESPONDED WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT AND GAINED IN ORIGINALITY WHILE REDUCING THEIR SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS. EACH CHILD DISPLAYED AN AREA OF PARTICULAR SENSITIVITY WHICH DEVELOPED TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN OTHER AREAS. THE STRONGEST AREA OF AESTHETIC COMPONENT RESPONSE BY THE CHILDREN WAS TO THE ACTIVITIES DEALING WITH RHYTHM.

IQ SCORES AND CULTURAL-SOCIOLOGICAL-ECONOMICAL STATUS INFLUENCE UPON SCHOOL READINESS WERE STUDIED. ALL CHILDREN INVOLVED WERE GIVEN THE PRIMARY MENTAL ABILITIES TEST (PMA), WHICH MEASURES VERBAL MEANING, NUMBER FACILITY, PERCEPTUAL SPEED, AND SPATIAL RELATIONS. PRETESTS AND POSTTESTS WERE GIVEN TO HEAD START CHILDREN. BOTH HEAD START AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE TESTED AT THE BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND END OF THE FIRST SCHOOL YEAR. CONTROL GROUP I (28 MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASS WHITE AND NEGRO CHILDREN, MATCHED WITH THE HEAD START GROUP BY AGE AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCALE)  WAS USED TO SEE HOW WELL HEAD START CHILDREN COULD APPROXIMATE THE SCHOOL CAPACITY OR IQ OF THE NONCULTURALLY DEPRIVED. CONTROL GROUP II WAS MADE UP OF 126 CLASSROOM PEERS. HEAD START CHILDREN SHOWED AN INCREASE IN IQ MEAN SCORES (86.56 TO 99.53) FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM TO THE END OF THE FIRST SCHOOL YEAR. THE GREATEST GAINS, AS MEASURED BY PMA SUBTESTS, WERE IN THE AREAS OF PERCEPTUAL SPEED AND NUMBER FACILITY. DURING THEIR FIRST TERM IN SCHOOL, GAINS WERE IN THESE SAME AREAS. THEREFORE, HEAD START HAD A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON SCHOOL READINESS, ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT ENABLE THE CULTURALLY DEPRIVED CHILDREN TO REACH THE SCHOOL READINESS LEVEL OF THE NONCULTURALLY DEPRIVED.

THESE TWO TESTS AND AN EXPERIMENTAL MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE, THE JOHNS HOPKINS PERCEPTUAL TEST (JHPT), HAD BEEN GIVEN TO 28 KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN. A SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RETARDATION INCIDENCE WAS FOUND WITH THE JHPT. ACTUAL PERCENTAGES WERE 69.56 ON THE PPVT, 17.86 ON THE CMMS, AND 3.57 ON THE JHPT. THEREFORE, AS A CRITERION MEASURE, THE STANFORD-BINET WAS ADMINISTERED TO EACH CHILD. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CHILDREN TESTED ON A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE THAN REPORTED ON THE PPVT AND CMMS, ALTHOUGH THE CMMS EXAGGERATED  LESS THE DEGREE OF RETARDATION. IN THE SAME SCHOOL, A SAMPLE OF FIRST GRADE CHILDREN REPRESENTING AN ENTIRE KINDERGARTEN CLASS OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR WAS GIVEN THE PPVT, CCMS, AND THE STANDFORD-BINET.

THE MEAN IQ SCORE INCREASED 18.86 POINTS ON PPVT PERFORMANCE, INDICATING THE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH THE STANFORD-BINET STILL PLACED ALL CHILDREN IN THE NONRETARDED CATEGORY, THE PPVT RATED 24.14 PER CENT AND THE CMMS SCALE, 10.34 PER CENT AS RETARDED.

THE CHILD POINTS TO ONE OF TWO, THREE, OR FIVE FORMS MATCHING A STIMULUS FORM. INITIAL TESTING WITH 44 CHILDREN RANGING IN AGE FROM 3 YEARS TO 5 YEARS 10 MONTHS SHOWED GOOD CORRELATION OF THE TEST SCORES WITH AGE AND THE RAW SCORES OF THE PEABODY PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST (PPVT). A SHORTENED TEST HAVING 30 CHOICES WAS DEVELOPED AND GIVEN TO TWENTY-TWO 4- TO 5-YEAR-OLD NURSERY SCHOOL CHILDREN. AGAIN, GOOD CORRELATIONS WITH AGE, THE PPVT, AND THE DRAW-A-PICTURE (DAP) TEST WERE OBTAINED. VALIDITY STUDIES OF THIS TEST, DESIGNATED THE JOHNS HOPKINS PERCEPTION TEST (JHPT),  HAVE SO FAR INVOLVED SOME 340 CHILDREN. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS OF THE SCORES ON THE JHPT WITH SCORES ON THE PPVT, THE DAP, AND THE COLUMBIA MENTAL MATURITY SCALE (CMMS) HAVE BEEN OBTAINED. A COMPARISON WAS MADE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF 37 UPPER AND 52 LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS CHILDREN ON THE JHPT, THE PPVT, AND THE DAP. THE DIFFERENCES IN MEAN SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS WAS HIGHEST FOR THE PPVT, LESS MARKED FOR THE DAP, AND STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE JHPT, SUGGESTING THAT IT MAY BE A CULTURE-FREE INSTRUMENT.

THROUGH ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMER, THE SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES OF TWENTY 5-YEAR-OLD CULTURALLY DEPRIVED NEGRO CHILDREN IN BALTIMORE WERE COMPARED TO THOSE OF A GROUP OF MIDDLE CLASS WHITE NURSERY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN BOSTON WHO WERE SUBJECTS OF A STUDY BY PAULA MENYUK. DIALECT DIFFERENCES WERE MINIMIZED BY A CONCEPT OF FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE WHICH EQUATED STATEMENTS HAVING DIFFERENT WORDS BUT THE SAME MEANING. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SENTENCES WHICH THE CHILDREN PRODUCED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SESSION, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES USED, AND AN AVERAGE SENTENCE COMPLEXITY SCORE WERE TAKEN AS INDICES OF LINGUISTIC  PERFORMANCE. A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN STRUCTURE USE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, WITH THE BOSTON GROUP USING MANY MORE SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES. THE NEGRO GROUP WAS NOT HOMOGENEOUS IN PERFORMANCE BUT HAD A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENCE IN COMPLEXITY AND NUMBER OF SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES USED. LARGE DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE NEGRO GROUP WOULD SUGGEST THAT ENVIRONMENT PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. IF LANGUAGE IS IMPLICATED IN THINKING BEHAVIOR, THEN IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DEGREE OF IMMATURITY IN LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD IS SIGNIFICANT IN THE CHILD'S GENERAL COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. EXPLORATION IN THIS AREA IS CONTINUING. THE NEGRO SPEECH SAMPLE IS BEING INCREASED, AND A TABLE OF STRUCTURAL EQUIVALENTS BETWEEN STANDARD ENGLISH AND THE NONSTANDARD ENGLISH OF NEGRO  CHILDREN IS BEING DEVELOPED. (MS)",

THE CHILDREN WERE ASKED TO ANSWER A QUESTION, TO DESCRIBE A SERIES OF PICTURES, AND TO RETELL A STORY. THE FREE SPEECH OF THE CHILDREN IN RESPONSE TO THESE SUB-TASKS WAS ANALYZED IN TERMS OF THE RANGE AND FREQUENCY OF SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES USED, THE NUMBER OF KERNEL AND TRANSFORMED SENTENCES USED, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYNTAX. THE DATA FROM THIS TASK IS NOT YET AVAILABLE. (2) AN IMITATION TASK REQUIRED THE CHILDREN TO REPEAT 20 SENTENCES USING 10 DIFFERENT SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES. EACH STRUCTURE WAS USED IN TWO SENTENCES. OF A POSSIBLE 400 CORRECT RESPONSES, 281 CORRECT RESPONSES WERE MADE. THE  LENGTH OF THE SENTENCE WAS FOUND TO BE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO NUMBER OF CORRECT RESPONSES FOR ONE SET OF THE STRUCTURES. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF MODIFICATION OF SENTENCES BY THE CHILDREN TO CONFORM THEM TO THEIR OWN LINGUISTIC SYSTEM. (3) THE SAME SENTENCES USED IN TASK NUMBER 2 WERE USED IN A COMPREHENSION TASK THAT REQUIRED THE CHILDREN, AFTER HEARING A SENTENCE, TO POINT TO THE PICTURE CORRESPONDING TO THAT SENTENCE FROM A THREE-PICTURE DISPLAY. CORRECT RESPONSES NUMBERED 266 OUT OF A POSSIBLE 400. LENGTH OF SENTENCE WAS NOT FOUND TO BE RELATED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THIS TASK. A RECOGNIZED PROBLEM IN INTERPRETING THE DATA FROM THESE TASKS IS CHOOSING CRITERIA THAT WILL RELIABLY INDICATE WHEN THE CHILD REALLY HAS CONTROL OF A PARTICULAR SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE.

THE REMAINING FOUR CONDITIONS WERE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS CONDITION ONE EXCEPT FOR VARIATIONS IN SCORING INSTRUCTION GIVEN (CONDITION TWO), USE OF REWARD (CONDITIONS THREE AND FIVE), AND TYPE OF WARM-UP (CONDITION FOUR). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT NEITHER VARIATION OF LETTER SIZE NOR SCORING INSTRUCTIONS HAD AN EFFECT ON PUPIL PERFORMANCE.

        "description":"THIS INVESTIGATION WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF AGE OF ENTRANCE INTO THE FIRST GRADE ON ARITHMETIC ACHIEVEMENT. THE SCORES ON ARITHMETIC ACHIEVEMENT TESTS WERE COMPARED FOR 378 LATE AND EARLY ENTRANT BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE FIRST TO SIXTH GRADES. THE LATE ENTRANTS WERE BETWEEN 8 AND 9 MONTHS OLDER THAN THE EARLY ENTRANTS. THEORETICALLY, AN EARLY START SHOULD NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OF LONG TERM DURATION. IN TESTING THIS CONCLUSION, THE ARITHMETIC ACHIEVEMENT SCORES WERE COMPARED ON THE BASIS OF BOTH GRADE AND AGE. FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT, MEASURED ON THE BASIS OF GRADE, THE ARITHMETIC ACHIEVEMENT SCORES WERE HIGHER FOR THE LATE ENTRANTS, BUT, MEASURED ON THE BASIS OF EQUATED AGE, THE EARLY ENTRANTS SCORED HIGHER. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT  OTHER FINDINGS IN THE AREA AND LEAD TO THE CONCLUSIONS THAT (1) PUPILS IN THE AMERICAN GRADE SCHOOLS CAN LEARN EARLIER IN LIFE THAN NOW THOUGHT, (2) THEY CAN LEARN MORE COMPLEX ARITHMETIC, AND (3) SUCH LEARNING MAY HAVE AN ENDURING CUMULATIVE EFFECT AT AGE 11. PERHAPS, AS A SUGGESTION, THE PRESENT ARITHMETIC CURRICULUM SHOULD BE REEVALUATED, FOR IT HAS TOO FREQUENTLY BEEN FOUND INSUFFICIENTLY STIMULATING TO THE PUPILS.

IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, 207 CHILDREN WITH A MEDIAN AGE OF 6.0 WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPONSIVENESS TO A HIERARCHY OF REWARDS. AFTER TWO SESSIONS INVOLVING TWO-CHOICE INSTRUMENTAL CONDITIONING TASKS, 60 PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN WERE CLASSIFIED AS RESPONSIVE TO TANGIBLE REWARDS, 30 PERCENT AS RESPONSIVE TO SOCIAL APPROVAL (HALF OF WHICH WERE ALSO RESPONSIVE TO CONFIRMATION OF CORRECT RESPONSE), AND 10 PERCENT AS UNRESPONSIVE TO ANY OF THE THREE REWARDS. IN A THIRD SESSION, STIMULI WERE PAIRED TO CONDITION THE CHILDREN TO BECOME RESPONSIVE TO PREVIOUSLY NONREWARDING STIMULI. A FINAL SESSION WAS DEVOTED TO EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED  REWARDS. DATA FROM THIS EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT TANGIBLE REWARDS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE FOR KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN THAN WERE APPROVAL REWARDS AND THAT APPROVAL REWARDS AND CONFIRMATION OF CORRECT RESPONSES WERE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED. IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT, INVOLVING 90 KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN, IT WAS FOUND THAT A NEUTRAL WORD CAN BE CONDITIONED TO BECOME A REWARD STIMULUS AND THAT CONDITIONING IS STRENGTHENED BY A PERIOD OF REWARD DEPRIVATION. EVIDENCE WAS ALSO OBTAINED SHOWING THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE UNDERACHIEVERS TEND TO BE LOWER IN APPROVAL RESPONSIVENESS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST CERTAIN PROCEDURES TO BE EMPLOYED IN ESTABLISHING ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION AMONG KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN. DETAILED STATISTICS ARE REPORTED IN 24 TABLES. (JS)",

AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SCHOOL YEAR,  POSTTESTING WAS ADMINISTERED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM ON MUSIC SKILLS AND ATTITUDES. COMPARISON OF PRETEST AND POSTTEST SCORES INDICATED GAINS IN TWO OF THE FOUR BASIC MUSIC SKILLS WHICH WERE TESTED. POSITIVE GROWTH IN ATTITUDES TOWARD MUSIC DID NOT OCCUR.

ALL WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN INDEPENDENT ACTIVITY, BUT WIDE DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY WERE OBSERVED. IN THE SECOND STUDY, 177 ADDITIONAL STUDENTS IN THE THIRD THROUGH SEVENTH GRADES WERE GIVEN ONE UNIT OF WORK. COMBINING THEIR SCORES WITH THE FIRST UNIT SCORES OF THE PREVIOUS STUDY, IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WAS A GENERAL TENDENCY FOR INQUIRY ACTIVITY TO INCREASE WITH  GRADE LEVEL, BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEX, INTELLIGENCE, OR READING LEVEL. IN THE THIRD STUDY, TWO EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO SEE IF INQUIRY BEHAVIOR COULD BE TAUGHT. THREE MEANS OF TEACHING WERE TRIED WITH 20 FIFTH GRADE CHILDREN IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, BUT NO EFFECT ON INQUIRY ACTIVITY WAS NOTED. A SECOND EXPERIMENT, USING A SPECIAL TRAINING CENTER, WAS CONDUCTED WITH 54 FIFTH GRADE CHILDREN, WHO WERE DIVIDED INTO THE CENTER SHOWED INCREASING INQUIRY ACTIVITY, BUT NO DIFFERENCE WAS NOTED BETWEEN TEACHER-DIRECTION OR STUDENT-DIRECTION, LEADING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SPECIAL ENVIRONMENT WAS THE CRITICAL FACTOR.

IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT (1) TEACHER DISAPPROVAL, POOR SELF CONCEPT, AND FAILURE TO GAIN APPROVAL SCHOLASTICALLY CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE REGRESSION OF THE CHILD THROUGH UNDERACHIEVEMENT, SCHOOL DROPOUT, DELINQUENCY, AND EVENTUAL OVERT CRIMINALITY, (2) THE TEACHER MUST MAKE CAREFUL  IDENTIFICATION OF CHILDREN EXHIBITING AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR AND ATTEMPT TO DELINEATE ITS EXACT CAUSE, AND (3) CURRICULAR INNOVATION CAN CONTRIBUTE MARKEDLY TO A DECREASED SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE, BUT MUCH RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON NEW METHODS OF MOTIVATING AND INSTRUCTING THE SOCIALLY DISRUPTIVE STUDENT.

A TREMENDOUS EDUCATIONAL VACUUM EXISTS IN THE AREA OF INTERPERSONAL EDUCATION, IN WHICH THE STUDENT LEARNS TO FUNCTION AS AN EFFECTIVE MEMBER OF A COORDINATED TEAM, RATHER THAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL. UNDER THE EXISTING EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SPORTS, TEAM EFFORT IS USUALLY NOT ENCOURAGED. SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS 4-H CLUB AND FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA DO EMPHASIZE COOPERATION AND TEAM EFFORT, BUT THIS KIND OF PRACTICE MUST BE FURTHER GENERALIZED TO ACADEMIC AREAS. THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR EDUCATIONAL PLANNERS AND PROGRAMS TO TRAIN PERSONNEL IN ANTICIPATION OF THE  FUTURE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHO WILL BE REQUIRED TO WORK ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AS MEMBERS OF A TEAM AS OUR SOCIETY MOVES TOWARD EVER GREATER DEGREES OF SPECIALIZATION.

HETEROGENEOUS NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS SET AND ATTAIN HIGHER EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND ARE MORE FAVORABLE TOWARD SCHOOL PRACTICES REPRESENTING A BREAK FROM TRADITION. HOMOGENEOUS NEIGHBORHOOD  RESIDENTS BELONG TO MORE ORGANIZATIONS, PREDOMINANTLY CHURCH AND SOCIAL, WHILE HETEROGENEOUS NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS ATTEND MORE MEETINGS, HOLD MORE OFFICES, AND SERVE ON MORE COMMITTEES OF ORGANIZATIONS, MAINLY AGRICULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL.

AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CLASSROOM AIDES EMPLOYED, IT BECAME NECESSARY TO DEFINE A CLASSROOM AIDE, AND OUTLINE AN AIDE'S QUALIFICATIONS AND DUTIES. USE OF THE CLASSROOM AIDE ALLOWED THE TEACHER MORE TIME FOR INDIVIDUALIZING INSTRUCTION, DEVELOPING TEACHING MATERIALS, AND TRIAL-TESTING CLASSROOM EXPERIMENTS AND  DEMONSTRATIONS PRIOR TO THEIR USE. TIME FOR SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTION BECAME MORE OF A REALITY BECAUSE THE TEACHER WAS FREED FROM SUCH NON-INSTRUCTIONAL DUTIES AS COLLECTING MONEY, TAKING ATTENDANCE, AND MARKING OBJECTIVE TYPE TESTS AND WORKBOOKS.

IN THE PROGRESSIVE VALUE OF THIS VARIABLE, COLOR, SIZE, PRESENCE OF PROMPTS, AND DURATION OF PRESENTATION WERE PROGRESSIVELY FADED TO THE TERMINAL DISCRIMINATION. THE SECOND VALUE OF THIS VARIABLE WAS THE TERMINAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE PROGRESSIVE STIMULI--THE B AND D CONSTANT IN THE ATTRIBUTES OF COLOR, SIZE, DURATION OF PRESENTATION, AND ABSENCE OF PROMPTS. THE SECOND VARIABLE WAS THE TIME OF INTRODUCTION OF THE  SECOND LETTER. TWO SEPARATE ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR THE TIME VARIABLE, BUT NOT FOR THE PROGRESSIVE-CONSTANT VARIABLE. THE EARLY-PROGRESSIVE COMBINATION RESULTED IN 81 PERCENT OF THE SUBJECTS LEARNING THE DISCRIMINATION WITH UNDER 10 PERCENT ERRORS.

        "description":"THE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE MOBILE SUBURBS (THE MEGALOPOLIS) ARE AS SERIOUS IN MAGNITUDE AND TOTAL EFFECT AS THOSE OF THE MUCH PUBLICIZED CENTER CITY. BECAUSE OF THE MOBILITY AND THE HETEROGENIETY OF THESE AREAS, MANY STUDENTS RECEIVE INADEQUATE EDUCATION AND ENTER SOCIETY AS SEMILITERATES. AN ANALYSIS OF CENTERVILLE, A TYPICAL MAGALOPOLITAN SCHOOL DISTRICT, REVEALED THAT CHILDREN LACKING IN BASIC SKILLS OFTEN ENTERED NEW SCHOOLS. THE SUCCESS OF REMEDIAL WORK VARIED WIDELY, AND, FREQUENTLY, SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND ACADEMIC PROBLEMS RESULTED. MARKED BY TRANSIENCY, INADEQUATE READING, EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, MANY STUDENTS BECAME DROPOUTS. THE MEGALOPOLITAN DROPOUT RATE OFTEN EQUALED THAT OF CENTER CITIES. A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM EMPHASIZES A JUNIOR HIGH  PROGRAM TO DEVELOP LITERACY AND PROPOSES MAJOR EXPENDITURES AT THE PRIMARY LEVEL TO ACHIEVE A TEACHER-PUPIL RATIO CONDUCIVE TO INDIVIDUAL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT.

INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS AND TRAINING IS MANDATORY. A VISUAL DISCRIMINATION PROGRAM OF DIFFERENTIATING AMONG LETTER FORMS AND AN AUDITORY DISCRIMINATION PROGRAM STRESSING LETTER NAMES AND SOUNDS CONSTITUTE THE MOST EFFICIENT READING READINESS PROGRAM. A TACTILE LEARNING SYSTEM REFINES AUDITORY DISCRIMINATION SKILLS. THE EFFECTIVE READING TEACHER IS ONE WHO USES DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE AS A DEVELOPMENTAL METHOD, INDIVIDUALIZING THE USE OF MATERIALS TO IMPROVE SPECIFIC READING SKILL AREAS. SEVEN MAJOR APPROACHES  TO THE TEACHING OF READING ARE LISTED--DEVELOPMENTAL, PHONIC, LINGUISTIC, LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE, ORTHOGRAPHIC STRESS, INDIVIDUALIZED-LIBRARY, AND SPECIAL. THEIR TEACHING SYSTEMS OR PHILOSOPHIES ARE DESCRIBED. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL READING ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE (BOSTON, APRIL 24-27, 1968). (BS)",

        "description":"THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF A HAWTHORNE EFFECT WERE PRESENT IN A 3-YEAR LONGITUDINAL STUDY WHICH COMPARED TWO METHODS OF TEACHING READING IN FIRST GRADE. THE INITIAL SUBJECTS WERE TWO TEACHERS AND FIVE FIRST-GRADE CLASSES OF RANDOMLY ASSIGNED STUDENTS WHO COMPOSED ONE EXPERIMENTAL, ONE CONTROL, AND THREE SUBCONTROL GROUPS. BEGINNING STUDENTS WERE TESTED AT THE END OF EACH OF THE 3 YEARS, AND AN ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND T-TEST WERE USED TO COMPARE PERFORMANCES. RESULTS INDICATED THAT AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR, BOTH THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL CLASSES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE SUBCONTROL GROUPS. THE THIRD YEAR EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POORER THAN THE FIRST YEAR EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, BUT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE FIRST-YEAR SUBCONTROL  GROUP. THE SECOND- AND THIRD-YEAR CONTROL GROUPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE FIRST-YEAR CONTROL AND SUBCONTROL GROUPS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT TWO TYPES OF HAWTHORNE EFFECTS--A NEGATIVE AND A POSITIVE--MAY HAVE BEEN OPERATING. THE EXPERIMENTAL TEACHER'S PERFORMANCE WAS POSSIBLY HEIGHTENED BY THE NEW METHOD AND ACCOMPANYING ACCOLADES. THE CONTROL TEACHER'S PERFORMANCE WAS DEPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF SUCCESS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL CLASS. PERHAPS A HAWTHORNE EFFECT DID NOT OPERATE FOR HER UNTIL THE SECOND AND THIRD YEARS.

HANDWRITING, COMPOSITION, SPELLING, AND GRAMMAR ARE DEALT WITH IN SEPARATE CHAPTERS. THE TOPICS COVERED RANGE FROM MANUSCRIPT AND CURSIVE WRITING TO \"CAN CREATIVE WRITING BE TAUGHT\" AND PHONICS AND WORD RECOGNITION. THE SEVENTH CHAPTER DISCUSSES RESEARCH IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. ONE SECTION DEALS WITH THE POSITION OF LISTENING IN THE LANGUAGE ARTS PROGRAM. DISCUSSIONS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LANGUAGE ARTS TO OTHER CULTURES AND FOREIGN LANGUAGES, MASS MEDIA, AND THE  IMPROVEMENT OF ORAL LANGUAGE COMPLETE THE STUDY.

SUB-PROBLEMS WERE (1) TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING AS INDICATED BY OBJECTIVE TEST SCORES, (2) TO DETERMINE WHETHER SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN PUPILS AT DIFFERENT GRADE LEVELS IN TERMS OF THEIR LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF EACH CONCEPT, AND (3) TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING WITHIN GRADES OF EACH CONCEPT AS INDICATED BY THE RELATIONSHIP OF TEST SCORES TO I.Q. AND AGE. THE GRADES IN WHICH SATISFACTORY MASTERY OF 11 SPECIFIC CONCEPTS ARE ATTAINED AT THE THREE SPECIFIC LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING (KNOWLEDGE, COMPREHENSION, AND APPLICATION) ARE OUTLINED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MANY OF THE  CONCEPTS COULD BE TAUGHT SUCCESSFULLY IN THE LOWER ELEMENTARY GRADES. HOWEVER, IT IS INDICATED THAT THE SELECTION OF CONCEPTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE CURRICULUM SHOULD BE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF MASTERY DESIRED--KNOWLEDGE, COMPREHENSION, OR APPLICATION.

        "description":"IN \"OBSCENITY--SOME PROBLEMS OF VALUES AND THE USE OF EXPERTS,\" JOHN P. FRAN, OUTLINES THE LEGAL BASIS FOR DETERMINING OBSCENITY AND ANALYZES THE FUNCTION OF EXPERTS IN SUCH A DETERMINATION. AN EXPERIMENT IS DESCRIBED IN WHICH FOUR PROFESSORS OF LITERATURE AND TWO PSYCHOLOGISTS WERE ASKED TO READ SELECTED WORKS AND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OBSCENITY OF THE MATERIAL. THE CONCLUSION REACHED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RESPONSES IS THAT, WHILE EXPERTS CAN DETERMINE THE LITERARY MERIT OF A WORK AND POSSIBLY THE INTENTION OF AN AUTHOR, THESE POINTS ARE OF LITTLE RELEVANCE IN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT A WORK IS STRICTLY PORNOGRAPHIC. FRANK CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING AN AREA WHERE EXPERT OPINION CAN BE OF VALUE--THE EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHY ON SOCIETY. ROBERT F. HOGAN, IN \"OBSCENITY AND THE  TEACHER--ANOTHER VIEW,\" TAKES UP THE UNIQUE PROBLEMS FACED BY TEACHERS OF ENGLISH AND PRESENTS THE VIEW THAT, SINCE PRNOGRAPHY CAN NEVER BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED, ITS EFFECTS SHOULD BE MINIMIZED BY DEVELOPING MATURE RESPONSES IN PEOPLE THROUGH EDUCATION.

THE THREE APPROACHES WERE--(1) TRI-COMPONENT, (2) THEMATIC LITERATURE-CENTERED, AND (3) COGNITIVE PROCESSES. THESE CURRICULUMS WERE USED FOR 3 YEARS WITH 1,000 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO WERE THEN TESTED AND COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT DIFFERENCES IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND RESPONSE AMONG THE THREE EXPERIMENTAL CURRICULUMS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT, ALTHOUGH THE TRI-COMPONENT CURRICULUM WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING CERTAIN KINDS OF LANGUAGE SKILLS AND WAS SUPERIOR TO THE MISCELLANEOUS  CONTROL CURRICULUMS. CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY WERE THAT AN ORGANIZED APPROACH TO TEACHING ENGLISH IS IMPORTANT, THAT A STRUCTURED CURRICULUM DOES NOT GUARANTEE EFFECTIVE STUDENT PERFORMANCE, AND THAT TEACHER BEHAVIOR HAS A CRITICAL EFFECT ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE RESEARCH FOCUS ON THE TEACHER AS WELL AS ON SUBJECT MATTER. (THE APPENDICES, CONTAINING PARTS OF THE THREE CURRICULUMS, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.

DISCRIMINATION AND CYNICISM IN AN INCREASINGLY AFFLUENT SOCIETY AND WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAVE UNDERMINED THE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE FACTORS AMONG THE DISADVANTAGED. DISADVANTAGED PUPILS MIGHT LEARN MORE EFFECTIVELY IF THE POSITIVE ASPECTS IN THEIR BACKGROUND WERE STRESSED, AND IF THE WIDE GAP BETWEEN SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY WERE NARROWED. MULTICULTURAL TEXTBOOKS, INCREASED PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE SCHOOL AND IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS, AND NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS WHICH FUNCTION AS IMPORTANT COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS ARE AMONG THE MEASURES WHICH MIGHT BE  EFFECTED. ALSO, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN MIGHT ACHIEVE BETTER IN MULTISOCIAL CLASS SETTINGS.

AN ACHIEVEMENT BATTERY, A SELF-CONCEPT INDEX, AND GRADE POINT AVERAGES WERE USED TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THE TEACHERS' KNOWLEDGE UPON PUPIL PERFORMANCE AFTER FIVE SEMESTERS.

SEGREGATED CLASSROOMS PERPETUATE IN THE NEGRO CHILD A FEELING OF SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP, WHICH IS BOTH UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL. SOUTHERNERS AND SOME NORTHERNERS CONTEND, HOWEVER, THAT \"DISCRIMINATION\" AND \"SEGREGATION\" ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS AND THEREFORE DUAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE PERMISSIBLE. IN THE NORTH SUCH FACTORS AS FEEDER PATTERNS, ZONING, AND FACULTY ASSIGNMENTS CONTRIBUTE TO DE FACTO SCHOOL SEGREGATION. LEGAL REMEDIES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY BECAUSE INTENT TO DISCRIMINATE MUST FIRST BE ESTABLISHED. FEDERAL PROGRAMS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY OF GHETTO AND IMPOVERISHED RURAL SCHOOLS, BUT UNTIL URBAN DE FACTO SEGREGATION CAN BE ATTACKED LEGALLY, LOCAL EFFORTS ARE NEEDED  TO BRING EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE TO EXISTING SEGREGATED SCHOOLS. IN PARTICULAR, THE SCHOOLS MIGHT REVISE DISCRIMINATORY PERSONNEL ASSIGNMENT POLICIES, INTRODUCE SOCIALLY RELEVANT CURRICULUMS AND PROGRAMS WHICH RAISE PUPILS' PERFORMANCE, AND ENCOURAGE FUTURE TEACHERS TO STUDENT TEACH IN SLUM SCHOOLS.

NONVERBAL RESPONSES, AND \"CONVERGENT\" AND \"DIVERGENT\" THINKING. PARENTAL BEHAVIOR IN HELPING THE CHILD WITH THE PROBLEMS WAS MEASURED BY RATING SCALES SCORED INDEPENDENTLY BY EACH OF THE OBSERVERS. ANALYSIS OF DATA ISOLATED A DIFFERENT FACTOR STRUCTURE FOR MOTHERS AND FATHERS AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES IN THE PATTERNING OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COMPARATIVE FACTORS. THE SEX OF THE CHILD  APPEARED TO BE AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOTHER FACTORS BUT NOT BETWEEN FATHER FACTORS. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONDITION OF THE APARTMENT AND FACTOR SCORES WERE CONDITIONED BY THE SEX OF THE PARENT AND THE SEX OF THE CHILD, AND THAT THE LEVEL OR SCORE ON SOME OF THE FACTORS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE CHILD'S SEX.

THE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION WAS CONDUCTED BY ONE VOCATIONAL AND ONE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. ONE CLASS WAS ORIENTED TO HANDICAPPED STUDENTS AND ONE WAS FOR OVERAGED UNDERACHIEVERS WITH NO HANDICAPS. A CURRICULUM WAS DEVELOPED BY THE COORDINATOR AND TEACHERS. THIRTY-THREE OF 35 STUDENTS ORIGINALLY ENROLLED COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. PRE AND POSTTESTS WERE GIVEN TO EVALUATE THE RATE OF GAIN IN  ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND ATTITUDE CHANGE. IMPROVEMENT WAS APPARENT, AND THE UNDERACHIEVING GROUP HAD A HIGHER RATE OF GAIN THAN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION GROUP. THE MAJOR CONCLUSIONS WERE--(1) SIX WEEKS IS TOO SHORT A PERIOD TO EVEN SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF THE MATERIAL REQUIRED BY THE STUDENTS, (2) MATERIALS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION MUST BE DIFFERENT IN FORMAT, READING LEVEL, AND RATE OF PRESENTATION, AND (3) A PROGRAM OF THIS TYPE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR USE DURING THE REGULAR ACADEMIC YEAR FOR SLOW LEARNERS AND UNDERACHIEVERS IN THE EARLY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADES.

THE ASSOCIATION'S POSITION ON NURSING EDUCATION HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING EDUCATION, PRACTICE AND SERVICE AND FOR AUXILIARY WORKER TRAINING--(1) THE MOVEMENT OF NURSE TRAINING INTO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REQUIRES THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXPANDING FACILITIES AND FACULTIES TO MEET THE EXPECTED APPLICANT INCREASE, PREPARING BOTH TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL NURSE PRACTITIONERS, AND CARRYING ON CONTINUING EDUCATION, ADVANCED STUDY, AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS, AND (2) THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF PRACTICAL NURSE WORK INDICATES THAT THEIR PRESENT TRAINING PROGRAMS BE REPLACED BY PROGRAMS FOR BEGINNING TECHNICAL NURSING PRACTICE IN JUNIOR AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO ALL NURSERIES AND GOLF COURSES IN THE STATE, AND RESPONSES WERE OBTAINED FROM 64.6 PERCENT OF THE NURSERIES AND 65.3 PERCENT OF THE GOLF COURSES. A SHORTAGE OF WELL-QUALIFIED WORKERS WAS REPORTED BY 92.8 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. MOST NURSERYMEN LEARNED BY BEING SELF-TAUGHT OR BY ON-JOB EXPERIENCE. SEASONAL WORKERS WERE STUDENTS. WAGES RANGED FROM $150 TO $450 PER MONTH. OF 171 PREDICTED JOBS BY 1972, 119 WERE OF A  SEMI-SKILLED CLASSIFICATION OR LESS. NURSERYMEN PROVIDED ON-THE-JOB TRAINING FOR SEASONAL WORKERS AND USED THE EMPLOYMENT CRITERIA OF HONESTY, WILLINGNESS TO WORK, DEPENDABILITY, AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BUSINESS. MOST EMPLOYEES WERE IN THE 16-20 OR 61-65 AGE RANGES. GOLF COURSE PROFESSIONALS DEEMED KNOWLEDGE OF GRASSES, SOILS, AND COURSE CONSTRUCTION AS NECESSARY FOR GOLF COURSE EMPLOYEES. LITTLE JUSTIFICATION WAS FOUND FOR A POST-HIGH SCHOOL ORNAMENTAL HORTICULTURE PROGRAM IN UTAH, BUT ORNAMENTAL HORTICULTURE UNITS IN HIGH SCHOOL VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE WERE NEEDED. (JM)",

        "description":"Growing bodies of research demonstrate that the quality of human perceptions, goals, and relationships depend largely on educational programs that prepare mothers and child care workers to foster children's full intellectual physical, and emotional development. A study was conducted to identify knowledge and competency clusters associated with non-professional child care occupations for use in occupational curriculums, or family life educational programs. A total of 255 persons employed in 96 day care centers, nurseries, Head Start projects, and migrant worker day care centers responded to a questionnaire to determine their major tasks. The tasks were analyzed to ascertain the knowledges necessary for their performance, and these were classified into child development, materials  and equipment, physical arrangements, and management knowledges. No relationship was found between the worker educational level and the tasks performed. Different work categories involve different levels of knowledge. All childcare workers needed knowledge at the lowest level while fewer would be expected to possess knowledge, at the highest level. Child care worker education could be expedited by the development of a knowledge taxonomy as a basis for a spiral curriculum whereby the various levels of knowledge could be taught at their appropriate place to prepare students for entry level jobs and occupational mobility. Basic child care knowledges probably should be taught and desirable personal characteristics developed in high school. A tentative taxonomy of levels derived from Blooms,&quot;Concept of the Cognitive Domain.&quot; A list of personal characteristics required to work effectively with children, references, research data, and the questionnaire are included.

The primary purpose of the program was to improve occupational choice-making of post-high school youth. Three hundred community college students whose verbal and quantitative scores on college entrance examinations fell below the 50th percentile and who had not made firm vocational choices were included in the study. A post-test control group design was implemented which included active and inactive control groups with subjects assigned randomly to five different treatment conditions. Results supported the major hypotheses: (1) reinforcement counseling techniques are effective for improving students' vocational decision-making; (2)  Reinforcement counseling techniques are effective for helping students acquire knowledge of sources of personal data and occupational information; (3) simulation materials are effective in improving students vocational decision-making; and, (4) simulation materials are effective for helping students acquire knowledge of sources of occupational information. The experimental program which incorporated testing, counseling, and occupational information services in a coordinated package was found to be effective for improving occupational choice-making of community college youth. An extensive appendix includes data, a typescript of a counseling session, information-gathering instruments, and occupational information. (ET)",

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PROPERTIES AD PROPOSITIONS OF THE  OPEN SYSTEM THEORY OF ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE INDICATED THAT (1) STEADY STATES OF SYSTEMS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED HIERARCHY, (2) PROGRESSIVE DEPARTMENTALIZATION SEEMS TO ACCOMPANY THE INTERPLAY OF SUBSYSTEMS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INDUCE CHANGE, (3) DISTRICTS ENCOURAGING DYNAMIC INTERPLAY ARE MORE LIKELY TO EMPLOY OUTSIDE SUPERINTENDENTS AND SUPPORT HIS EFFORTS FOR CHANGE, AND (4) SCHOOLS WITH INTERNAL FEEDBACK SYSTEMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO THAN RESIST STRONG OUTSIDE PRESSURES. A CONCLUSION IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE THEORY PREDICTIONS STATED THAT THE MORE HIERARCHICAL THE STRUCTURE OF AN ORGANIZATION AND THE MORE FUNCTIONAL THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY BETWEEN SUBSYSTEMS, THE GREATER THE PROBABILITY OF VOCATIONAL PROGRAM CHANGE.

THE MOTION THAT HIGH SCHOOL IS FOR COLLEGE-BOUND STUDENTS GREATLY LIMITS THE OPPORTUNITIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO NOT ATTEND COLLEGE, AND IF EDUCATION IS THE RIGHT OF ALL YOUTH, SOMETHING IS OUT OF BALANCE. IF THIS IMBALANCE IS TO BE IMPROVED, THE GENERAL IMAGE OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION MUST BE IMPROVED. THIS IMAGE WITHIN ANY INDIVIDUAL HIGH SCHOOL CAN BE CHANGED BY THE PRINCIPAL'S LEADERSHIP AND ATTITUDE IN HIS INSISTENCE THAT VOCATIONAL EDUCATION DEVELOP A RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE COMPLETE ORGANIZATION OF THE SCHOOL. THIS CHANGE WILL CAUSE BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL  CONFLICTS WHICH WILL REQUIRE MORE OF THE PRINCIPAL THAN NOMINAL LEADERSHIP AS HIS ACTUAL LEADERSHIP MAY BE CHALLENGED. THE JOB WILL CONSIST OF CHANGING THE ATTITUDES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR HIMSELF, THE ENTIRE FACULTY, THE COMMUNITY, AND THE STUDENTS. SUGGESTIONS AND GUIDELINES ARE OFFERED TO THE PRINCIPAL FOR CHANGING ATTITUDES AND ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. THE ATTITUDE OF THE PRINCIPAL, HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY, AND ABILITY TO ENLIST HELP FROM ALL AVAILABLE SOURCES ARE REAL AIDS TO THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS.

HOWEVER, A REASONABLE, AND PROBABLY MINIMAL, ESTIMATE OF \"SUBEMPLOYMENT\" (A COMPOSITE MEASURE OF BOTH JOBLESSNESS AND EMPLOYMENT AT SUBSTANDARD WAGES) IN THESE POVERTY AREAS WOULD BE 1.5 MILLION. THE FACTORS WHICH PRODUCE SUBEMPLOYMENT IN BIG CITY POVERTY AREAS ARE AS DIVERSE AS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED. THEY ARE ALSO INTERRELATED, MUTUALLY REINFORCING, AND DIFFICULT TO DISENTANGLE. SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS, LACK OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING, ILL-HEALTH, DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER EMPLOYER PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO SELECTION OF EMPLOYEES, AND DISTANCE FROM AVAILABLE JOBS ARE AMONG THE  MANY BARRIERS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO JOBLESSNESS, UNDEREMPLOYMENT, AND LOW EARNINGS. THE BARRIERS WHICH SEPARATE SUBEMPLOYED SLUM RESIDENTS FROM THE MAINSTREAM OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE HAVE RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF AN IRREGULAR ECONOMY IN POVERTY AREAS, A SEPARATE ECONOMIC WORLD WHICH DIFFERS VITALLY FROM THE MIDDLE-CLASS WORLD SURROUNDING THE SLUMS. THIS WORLD HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL VALUES, ITS OWN STRATEGIES FOR SURVIVAL, ITS OWN MORAL STANDARDS, AND ITS OWN CRITERIA OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE. MOTHERS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM OF AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN ARE USED IN AN ILLUSTRATIVE STUDY OF ONE GROUP OF SUBEMPLOYED IN THE IRREGULAR ECONOMY.

FORMULATION OF STRATEGY FOR A COORDINATED MANPOWER AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY REQUIRES ANSWERS TO SEVERAL QUESTIONS, INCLUDING--(1) HOW CAN THE EMPLOYMENT POTENTIAL OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND THE POTENTIAL RESULTS OF VARIOUS ACTION PROGRAMS BE BETTER EVALUATED, (2) SHOULD PRESENT MEASURES TO STIMULATE PRIVATE BUSINESS AND JOB EXPANSION BE STRENGTHENED AND SUPPLEMENTED, (3) COULD INTERAREA DIFFERENCES IN UNEMPLOYMENT BE REDUCED THROUGH CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT AND TRANSPORTATION POLICIES AND DECISIONS REGARDING THE LOCATION OF FACILITIES, AND (4) WHAT BALANCE SHOULD VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING ACHIEVE BETWEEN PREPARING PEOPLE FOR LOCALLY REQUIRED OCCUPATIONS AND PREPARING  THEM FOR OUT-MIGRATION.

BY THE END OF 1967, THE OVERALL UNEMPLOMENT RATE AND THE RATES FOR MOST (BUT SIGNIFICANTLY NOT ALL) GROUPS IN THE LABOR FORCE WERE THE LOWEST SINCE THE KOREAN WAR. A TYPICALLY MORE-DELAYED RECOVERY CHARACTERIZED THE VULNERABLE GROUPS. LARGE NUMBERS OF THESE WORKERS HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO BENEFIT FROM THE ADDITIONAL JOBS, OCCUPATIONAL UPGRADING, AND RISING INCOMES THAT HAVE ACCOMPANIED HIGH AND SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH.  BUT THE FIRST SIGNS OF ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN 1967 WERE REFLECTED IN LAYOFFS OF BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS AND IN RISING UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG UNSKILLED WORKERS, NEGROES, AND TEENAGERS. RENEWAL OF THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION BROUGHT TO THE FORE THE DANGERS THAT ATTEND RAPID GROWTH, SUCH AS RAPIDLY RISING PRICES, INCREASED COSTS OF PRODUCTION, AND INDUSTRIAL SHIFTS, WHICH COULD RESULTS IN UNBALANCED GROWTH AND THREATEN CONTINUATION OF PRESENT PROGRESS.

This relationship seeking is set in a context of career development theory and a concern for guidance practice. The monograph is a sequel to &quot;Measuring Adolescent Personality&quot; (MAP), which reports the factor analytic research on the TALENT battery. A measurement theory is reviewed for describing adolescent personality in its educationally relevant traits. Some evidence on the etiology and the stability of the traits and some technical aspects of making the measurement of these traits operational are discussed. Predictive validities were  established for the traits against the follow-up studies' criteria in the areas of educational and vocational adjustments and career development. These prediction studies were accomplished by computing the 22 MAP factor scores for each of the individuals included in the study, following the procedures outlined in the original MAP report. The authors also deal with the issue of what career guidance should be, given the career theory developed. (im)",

The Laubach method does not depend on a plot but uses a chart which pictures an English phrase, letter, word, and stylized representation of the first letter of the word. The Gouin Theme Method is Gestalt in approach as the entire sentences are linked to others and form a story. The Community Approach Method structures lessons around daily happenings familiar to adult students. The Basic English Method provides an 850 word basic vocabulary for foreign born illiterates. A four step experience is used in the Direct Method, consisting of (1) filmstrips of whole stories expressed in underlined sentences, (2) duplication of the story through use of flash cards and other teaching  materials, (3) phonetic attack on words, and (4) comprehension. A sixth method adds television teaching in the Laubach Method. Establishment of good rapport and permissive classroom climate are essential to the nondirective approach in the Lark Method.

There is a growing need for a new kind of university that would aggressively approach city problems, such as an urban-grant university. This institution would become directly involved in improving the total urban environment -- architecture, use of space, health, poverty, cultural, educational equality and recreational programs -- and thus bridge the gap between campus and community. It would offer city-oriented curricula and research studies, and set up experiment stations to attack municipal problems. Public high school students would benefit from counseling, cooperation between their teachers and university  faculty to improve the system's curricula, and other aid that would ensure a smooth transition from high school to college. For heterogeneity, the urban-grant university would aim to attract eligible students within and beyond the surrounding community. Faculty and trustees should be selected on a non-political basis, for their concern with the problems and readiness to seek more effective solutions. The federal government could help to provide land and funds for urban-grant universities or for expansion of existing campuses.

Of the total lay and religious faculty selected at both institutions, almost 50% responded. The 59-item questionnaire dealt with the full-time faculty's perception of what academic governance is, what their role should be, and satisfaction with their actual role. It also asked for personal data -- level of education, rank, tenure, professional societies, research and campus activities. Both the men's and women's college faculties felt that they should have the major voice in academic decision making but that joint faculty-administration decisions should govern religious and lay personnel matters, financial, student, public and alumni affairs. In the area  of capital improvements, the men wanted less administrative responsibility than the women. Dissatisfaction with actual decision-making roles was evident, but in the area of faculty-administration relations the women were less satisfied than the men, who were indifferent. The religious held higher degrees and academic ranks than the lay faculty, who were younger and stayed at the college for shorter periods. Both groups often participated in campus activities. A comparison of 33 pairs of mean weights for religious and lay faculty at each college revealed that on all but 7 of the 66, differences between the 2 groups at both colleges were insignificant, i.e., on nearly all variables concerning shared governance, agreement between the faculties was almost unanimous.

Student and parent opinions, as perceived by students, were collected from 3 colleges: (1) a highly selective institution drawing students mainly from the upper socioeconomic levels. Parents were liberal in their political-social outlook and belonged mainly to the Democratic Party. (2) an institution in which students, parental occupations and incomes were typically middle class. Parents were mostly Republicans and Protestants. (3) a public institution drawing students from a metropolitan area. Few parents were  college educated; most were bluecollar workers, Democrats and Catholic. On issues such as: Supreme Court decisions on civil rights, the Vietnam war, aid to minority groups, general welfare programs, the House Un-American Activities Committee, the use of cigarettes, alcohol, LSD and Marijuana, artistic, financial and intellectual interest humanitarian ideals, politics, religion, recreation and vocational pursuits, students faithfully reflected the attitudes of their parents. While many parents may not understand other people's children, there is little support for the popular notion of a generation gap.

        "description":"The most significant development in higher education in the last 20 years is the essentialist-existentialist confrontation--the formal versus the vital. What we decide about this matter will determine what we do with all other developments. Essentialists in education are concerned with what is permanent and rational and contend history is a worthy teacher. Existentialists center attention on man as man and consider the search for meanings crucial. They are concerned with present and personal relevance, with ambiguities, and seek to learn from the full range of human experiences. Their methodology is provisional but operational and their style often improvisational. Modes of learning today, though disputed, are influenced mainly by essentialists although they too are curious about  innovations. Because they are in control, changes most likely to succeed are those that complement existing practices, are reached by consensus, and are suggested by tradition-conscious innovators. Thus the innovative process today is characterized by changes WITHIN rather than OF systems. Existentialists are more likely to favor curriculum variations that free the individual from the dominance of the institution, boredom of a speciality, and force him to face political and social questions. Because much current effort is piecemeal and shortsighted, we need inclusive innovators who have philosophical scope, perspective on options, and appreciation of the dynamics of change in complex organizations to generate inclusive innovations.

        "description":"At a conference on \"Education for Creativity in the American College,\" educators, artists and researchers considered the proposition that: \"Little has been done to provide appropriate academic experiences for highly creative students during the post-adolescent years, and many colleges seem to lose more talented and creative students than they educate.\" Research is made difficult because too often, freshmen who combine high intelligence, interest in intellectual matters and apparent potential for creative work leave campus before follow-up tests and interviews can be held. It was found, however, that students who approach intellectual work in ways characteristic of creative people were less likely than others to graduate, even at MIT and another outstanding institute of science  and engineering. Although students who enjoy independent thinking do tend to leave college earlier, it is not known whether this is related to actual creative productivity in academic and scientific fields. Creative people are made, not born, and research shows the lack of a distinct relationship between intelligence and creativity. The home environments of scientists, mathematicians and architects judged creative by associates were found to be similar and could well serve as models for colleges. If creativity embodies independent thinking, self-awareness, openness to experience and breadth of vision, education for creativity should be possible to develop in college. But there is no single program since the development of creativity seems to call for a balance between tensions in the  educational environment. (JS)",

To measure student values and differences in intellectual dispositions, the Center designed a research instrument, the Omnibus Personality Inventory (OPI). But the question is: in which students and on which campuses is growth most likely to take place? The Trent-Medsker study BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL, which followed 10,000 high school graduates through the next 4 years of their lives as they entered college, the labor market or full time homemaking, indicates that college students become more tolerant, flexible and autonomous in their thinking whereas persons  who embark on jobs or homemaking are uninterested in reflective thought. This is borne out by 3 of the OPI scales. By including youths who did not attend college as a control group, it was shown changes cannot be attributed to maturity alone. Related studies show the movement from occupational to intellectual orientations, from grade to learning consciousness, from extrinsic to intrinsic rewards. Very different students attend a wide variety of institutions and studies are under way to identify what factors in the learning environments of 12 colleges promote or inhibit intellectual changes. In its dedication to understanding the processes of higher education, the Center is measuring the entering student, the graduate, and developing means for assessing what happens in between.  (JS)",

T. R. McConnell believes that problems can be selected which have both theoretical and practical relevance--a combination appealing to government-sponsored research and development centers. College-sponsored offices of institutional research have traditionally been concerned with operational problems although results of such research have limited or no relevance to academic problems and purposes. The fact that colleges fail to adopt policies or practices of verified worth indicates the need for utilizing knowledge  produced by research. Government and private agencies have recognized that development is as important as research in effecting change. Evaluation of development is also necessary although difficult when goals cannot be tangibly measured.

Among 10,000 high school seniors tested, the group intending to go to college differed in ability, socioeconomic background, parental encouragement, academic motivation and attitudes from those going on to jobs or homemaking. Students who spent 4 uninterrupted years in college became more intellectual and developed a critical, flexible, nonjudgmental type of thinking whereas few students in the employed group made such changes. Experiences in college seem to nourish greater growth in intellectuality and autonomy when the potential for such growth exists. And a student's potential for growth is largely determined by parental influence early in life. Thus, because  parental influence is the student's strongest motivation factor to remain in college, ways should be found to help instill this motivation when parental support is missing. A strong case may be made for counseling to begin in the earliest grades and continue throughout the entire educational experience. (CS)",

In the Campus Governance Project investigating the nature of governance, over 3,000 questionnaires were administered and 900 intensive interviews conducted at 19 institutions. The questionnaire was designed to identify problems of governance and determine which individuals were considered knowledgeable and influential in dealing with them and how they became so. It was generally found that today's governance is more complex, more involved with negotiated exchange among many internal and external factions than before. Presidents retain accountability for all that happens on their campus though their ability to control it has declined.  Patterns are hard to change because: most academicians believe that practices adopted by other institutions are inappropriate to their own; most change occurs by accretion; self-interest rather than concern for the institution dominates decision making. Major sources of friction are the budget and distribution of information regarding it, delegation of authority, and the method of announcing decisions (particularly bad news). Extreme resentment was expressed against state education departments, presidents and deans of students. Among a number of suggestions for improving governance, the most widely adopted is that of a campuswide governing body composed of representatives from all factions. Despite complaints, however, changes might provoke even greater dissatisfaction. (JS)",

Since 1945, rapidly changing technology has increased demands for expert manpower and eradicated or considerably decreased the need for unskilled labor. The educational system responds to this challenge by preparing professionally qualified manpower. A growing participation in education is evidenced by a steadily increasing student population. Now viewed as an investment in human resources, education is becoming politically relevant and emerging as a national concern. The Federal Government, private foundations, and national associations directly involved in matters concerning US political economy are including educational programs as part of their activities. Stabilizing efforts  within the educational community include alliances of smaller colleges to compete with larger universities, curricular and other adjustments within single institutions, and educational decision-making arrangements between private concerns and local, state and federal agencies. In order to shift educational control away from the political arena, coordination of autonomous educational institutions is proposed for interorganizational administration of policy and practice.

Some common features that help to analyze the character of an institution were discovered in a study of historical developments which occurred during a 40 to 50-year period at 3 colleges (Antioch, Reed, and Swarthmore). College curricula usually incorporate the educational aims of a college and shed light on what the academic commitments of the institution are. Varying degrees of authority distributed between trustees, faculty, administrators, and sometimes students, may determine what values will be supported and what programs are eventually developed and instituted as part of the formal structure. Faculty members' belief in the college and their ability to  defend and sustain its values link them with the institution's history and self-image. The variety of student interests, personalities, educational and occupational plans, and roles strongly influence campus orientation. Outside the campus, how a college is regarded - and by whom - helps determine the public image component of its character. Institutional viability is positively affected by linkages with certain constituencies that have students from particular social strata, and the nature of relations between the institution and financial donors, including the Federal Government. Guidelines for conducting an organizational analysis of any particular institution are included. (WM)",

Of the graduates who entered college, almost 50% withdrew before obtaining a bachelor's degree, but this dropout rate did not seem to be linked with lack of ability.

Institutional change has usually resulted from pressures for economy and efficiency by state planners. In a 2-year study of statewide planning in 4 states (California, New York, Illinois and Florida), the Center attempted to identify how decisions made outside of institutions affected their missions and roles. Florida is developing 2 state institutions based on the \"senior institution\" concept, one of which - through \"villages\" or residential colleges - also offers a tightly integrated living-learning arrangement for faculty and students. The State of Illinois has approved construction of 2 institutions based on a senior institution-commuter  model. A new challenge for higher education is to develop new teaching-learning processes that would meet the growing demands of an increasingly diverse range of students. University faculty, administrators and students have not usually participated in the development of proposals which eventually alter the basic concepts and purposes of their institutions. Very few statewide plans, therefore, include approaches to more academic effectiveness. It is proposed that educators should, in the interest of future patterns of higher education, demand thorough analyses of state plans before they are implemented and more intensive evaluations once they are operational.

A central college subsidy agency, operating on a limited budget, would be required to allocate funds according to the maximum overall social contributions of the students. Emphasis would be placed on present benefits to society rather than the student's future economic contributions. This policy would reduce present stress on intellectual ability as an important criterion for student subsidy, and include criteria such as family financial status, type of career best suited to student, and overall intellectual ability. The total cost of subsidizing a student would be covered  by the funds paid directly to him as well as to the college where he is trained; colleges would be induced to provide their services at cost. Other considerations in awarding a scholarship would be the appropriateness of the selected college for the student's particular abilities and the amount of money he can contribute toward his education. The college would be selected by the student within limits set by the agency. This system would increase the current subsidy level and encourage an expansion of quality college education to include larger segments of the population. (WM)",

During  the conference, each participant developed an innovative program for his campus that was then evaluated by conference consultants. Subjects covered curriculum and leadership development, student counseling and college activities, and student personnel administration. After further assessment of their proposals, the 83 participants will attempt to establish the new programs at their campuses. A survey will be made in Spring 1969 to determine whether they were instituted; and if so, what the results of actual application were. (WM)",

        "description":"Professional and technical fields are the fastest growing occupational sectors in the US. More than one-third of all professional and technical workers are employed by government, particularly in administrative positions, and exert an increasing influence on public policy. But, with the exception of city managers, many of these employees regard themselves as members of the disciplines in which they were trained rather than primarily as public administrators. The field of public administration has not influenced public policy as much as other fields have, possibly because: it is not a specialized profession; practitioners do not agree on what its core knowledge, skills and orientation should be; and there is little incentive for students to pursue studies in the field since most  administrative positions are held by other specialists. Although more attention in colleges is now being paid to administrative and management fields, courses are usually based on organizational theories of private business models, with little emphasis on the unique problems of government administration. Professional schools suffer from a general bias against teaching the kinds of subjects that might be useful in government jobs. Hence, many professional administrators lack the skills, knowledge or attitudes to deal with increasing social problems. To meet the growing demand and suggest future action for trained public administrators, a research proposal is offered for evaluating the roles of educational institutions, governmental agencies, and assessing the attitudes of professional  public officials.

Tables provide summary data by level of degree, field of specialization, sex of recipient, state, level of institution and institutional control. Publicly controlled institutions accounted for about 60% of degrees earned, an increase of about 11% over the 1965-66 figure. Men received about 62% of all degrees--about 58% of all bachelor's, about 96% of all first-professional degrees, about 65% of all master's and about 88% of all doctorates. At the bachelor's and master's levels, more degrees were awarded in elementary  education than in any other field. Law led the first-professional level and chemistry led in doctorates. The one Table concerned with awards below the bachelor's level summarizes the number of associate degrees awarded by sex, institutional control and type. A copy of the questionnaire used to gether this information and instructions to respondents are reproduced in the appendix.

Of non-partisan detachment? How should an administrator respond to such situations? What guideline for action should he consider? What kinds of situations will he most likely face and what are their most likely consequences for internal and external relations? What may be the future role of higher education as a principal change agent in society? Organized by the Center for Research and Development in Higher  Education and the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, the conference was attended by 20 college presidents and about 80 staff members, deans and faculty representing 60 institutions. Alternative views on the conference topic were presented in major papers by T. R. McConnell, Harris Wofford, Roger Heyns, Algo Henderson, Eldon Johnson and Kenneth Boulding. A colloquium, bringing together a great diversity of viewpoints and experience, gave expression to the several schools of thought presently attempting to redefine the role of higher education in society.

        "description":"With the establishment in 1959 of a small experimental college within a large public city university, a record was kept of the impact of the college's high demand program on the working class students recruited from the university. To document the progress of the new institution and its students, a huge volume and variety of data was collected and social science analyses ranging from demographic studies following different stages of the social history of the student population, to analyses of variables, pattern analyses, sociometric analyses and combinations of all previous approaches were made. A flow chart of the students' career is drawn measuring quality of earlier work, outcome, scholarship level, perseverence, pace. The effect of the students' parents' lack of education on  preparation and performance is measured and patterns of the students' adjustment to high academic demands and personal development are sketched. Researchers examined student reactions to various aspects of different faculty roles (as lecturer, discussion leader, tutor, counselor etc.) as well as to alternative learning situations. The conclusion is that an excellent college can be effective in a \"streetcar\" college setting with unselective admission if students and faculty are highly involved in the educational process. Volume II contains selected research conducted at the college by researchers of different disciplines and interests on many aspects of the college environment and student development. (JS)",

        "description":"To encourage the teaching of British Commonwealth literature to American university students, a broad ranging survey course was designed in which the material was thematically organized. A great body of literature from the 13 countries was scrutinized in order to select 147 representative poems and short stories for an anthology. An effective method was devised for students to participate in the selection and evaluation of the literature. In addition to the new anthology, a &quot;Handbook&quot; of background materials on the authors and countries was compiled and both works will be largely incorporated into a new published college text on World Literature in English. The course that emerged from this research concentrated mainly on the literatures of 4 countries--Canada, Australia, New  Zealand, South Africa--and tended to become not a survey course in British literature but a course in the comparative study of those literatures. Although the project could have been more complete, much was learned about this large but neglected body of writing in English and an effective student-tested teaching tool--the thematic anthology--was developed and used. The appendices include a preliminary anthology selection, proposed thematic organization, course book lists and outlines, and class themes, tests and exams. (JS)",

        "description":"Of the original number of Alaskan natives entering the University of Alaska from rural and urban areas, 50% drop out at the end of their freshman year, and less than 2% are likely to receive a degree at the end of 4 years. This high attrition rate is caused by poor elementary and secondary school preparation, and strong personal feelings of inadequacy that are intensified at a campus that is both integrated and oriented toward Western culture. An educational experiment, College Orientation Program for Alaskan Natives (COPAN), was initiated in 1964 by the University of Alaska in cooperation with USOE and with grant-in-aid support from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It is a special 4-year, 6-week summer program focusing on language development and cultural awareness, and available  on a voluntary basis to all native Alaskan high school seniors who meet the university's entrance criteria (high school GPA 2.0 or better). It offers selected courses on Western cultures, informal seminars and discussions, field trips, and living accommodations in Western homes. Counseling is provided to help students resolve transitional problems and develop confidence and competence. The academic survival rate for COPAN students in 1965-67 was 51%, compared to 38.7% for native non-COPAN students. Within this non-COPAN group, drop-out rates have decreased since 1965, indicating a possible increase in academic survival for the entire native Alaskan group. A University proposal for an expanded version of COPAN is included. (WM)",

        "description":"At the George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee, 50 male students responded to a questionnaire concerning their reactions to individuals having mental or physical disabilities, to persons of another race, and to gifted persons. The 20 questions (scale items) focused on association with 12 types of \"disabled\" persons (disability labels). The test was designed to explore connotative reactions to different disability labels when personal involvement is implied, and was administered under standard and ambiguous testing conditions. In the ambiguous condition, the questionnaire minus the scale items was used and the students were asked to repeat their original responses from memory. Disability labels used were: epileptic, mentally retarded, blind, cerebral palsied,  gifted, Negro, crippled, emotionally disturbed, deaf, amputee, normal, and stutterer. Although not considered disability labels, gifted and Negro were included for separate interpretations of sub-scale and total scale scores. The 20 items ranged from \"How would you feel about talking in public with each of the persons listed?\" to \"How would you feel about marrying each of the persons listed?\" Answers were made along a 5-point comfort-discomfort continuum to which weights (1 through 5 for intensity of feeling) were assigned. The results confirmed the hypothesis that connotative meanings are commonly assigned to mentally and physically handicapped persons by non-disabled groups in our society, and that this attitude is extended to members of racial minorities.

The growing number of potential non-white college students and the militance of those already enrolled present a new challenge to institutions of higher education and raise many issues, 4 of which are of special import: (1) before promising to meet militant student demands concerning the percentage of black students to be enrolled, each college or university needs to reevaluate its educational objectives and financial resources, arrive at an independent and realistic decision, then make a sustained effort to achieve its goals. Results of this examination might vary; black enrollments might not increase from the present 2% at some institutions but they might go up to  20% or 30% at others, such as public colleges in urban settings. (2) The fact that racial issues will continue to be important but difficult aspects of US society must be considered when colleges seek to arrive at conclusions regarding their enrollments of minority group students. (3) Some consensus must be reached within the academic community on how students and institutions will be financed. Massive local, state and federal support would seem to be one solution. (4) Relationships between elementary, secondary and higher education institutions need improvement. Cooperative attitudes among the 3 levels would lead to smoother transition of disadvantaged youth from school to college. (WM)",

Methods of collecting, correlating, and evaluating the data are described. In comparing each group's self-rating  with its rating by each of the other three groups, two consistent differences emerged: (1) each group (by its collective self-image) saw itself more interested in teaching than others did and (2) each group felt that each other group was better liked by students than it was itself. Tables show the importance of the characteristics as ranked by the regular staff, by first-year interns, and by all four groups. Competence, interest in teaching, knowledge of subject matter, and sensitivity to student needs generally ranked highest; sociability came last. Noteworthy irregularities in rating and the characteristics most often perceived differently are pointed out. (HH)",

The hypothesis supported by the findings was that the goals of a 2-year community college will not be adequately served in a 4-year college even where there is a formal commitment by the 4-year college to serve such goals. Variables measured were: (1) background and rationale for upward extension, (2) formal intent of the enabling legislation, (3) goals and philosophy of the college, (4) attitudes of administrators, (5) attitudes of faculty, (6) curriculum, (7) attitudes of trustees, (8) costs to students, (9) admission policy, and (10) probation and retention policies. Among the conclusions: (1) demand was manifested for a 4-year institution to serve students  within commuting distance of the 2-year colleges; (2) before the change, the colleges were unable to institutionalize themselves as 2-year colleges within the community; (3) once a movement for upward extension begins, it automatically increases unless conditions are altered; (4) when statewide planning fails to provide 4-year college facilities in a given area of proven need, the 2-year college will encounter irreconcilable problems in institutionalizing itself; (5) a 2-year college staff generally has a vested interest in promoting upward extension of its college, and (6) expanding existing 2-year college facilities seems more economical than constructing new 4-year facilities.

Problems treated are: (1) definition of a marine technician, (2) how marine technicians should be classified, (3) how great is the demand for them, (4) the type of work they do, (5) what skills and training they need, (6) their pay scale, (7) women as marine technicians, (8) how a junior college educates and trains marine technicians, (9) which junior colleges are already doing so, (10) the amount of financial support for this program, and (11) the type of evaluation program that should be set up. General points and recommendations are: (1) marine technology involves marine oil and mining,  aquaculture, oceanography, fisheries technology, research and hardware; (2) civil service organizations should establish classifications and pay scales for marine technicians; (3) demand for marine technicians in the next five years will be about 38,000; (4) at least 20 junior colleges in America will be involved with marine technology by the early 1970's (half of them in California); (5) financing the programs is very difficult; and (6) in establishing a program, communities should inspect carefully the demand for marine technicians, community attitudes, proximity of marine facilities, ability to finance, and availability of experienced staff.

Projected increases in tourism and hotel construction indicate substantial need for well trained personnel. Courses are listed for 4-year and 2-year degree programs, plus 1-year certification programs, job-entry training, and continuing education courses appropriate to the hotel and restaurant industry needs. Schemes are presented by which local industry, government, and other special publics can become involved and motivated to promote acceptance of the courses offered at the Kauai Community College. Sources of students to fill the demand are  suggested and other public relations and publicity ideas are outlined to attract students to the hotel and restaurant industry courses and curriculum. Specific facilities and equipment are recommended for acquisition and use, including television recording and playback equipment, demonstration kitchens, and full-scale, hotel front-office laboratories. Both general and specific sources of funding are suggested and continuous evaluation of the overall program is recommended. (RM)",

This related to (1) the improving educational level of the general population, (2) the changing and increasingly complex world, (3) increasing leisure, and (4) the rising standard of living. Junior colleges are in a unique position to meet the diverse demands of a rapidly-changing society. As shown by the abundance of federally supported programs in America's 2-year colleges, a major emphasis in the future will be on the training and retraining of adults. Our technological society is going to demand continuing adult education. Greater involvement with local employers is  necessary in planning future adult programs. There is no sound research to suggest that instructors of adults need special attributes or characteristics not common to instructors in other areas. There appears, however, to be a problem relating to \"credits\" for adult education courses and this issue affects the staffing possibilities available to the junior college. If a \"credit course\" requires an instructor with a master's degree, the adult education program is in real jeopardy. Junior colleges are going to enroll more and more adult students in the future. More viable programs are needed to accommodate this increased number of students. (RM)",

        "description":"This report cites the inadequate and chaotic means being used to establish new junior college libraries today. Booklists &quot;borrowed&quot; from other junior colleges are too specifically oriented to the needs of the lending institution, and lists generated by associations are too broadly based to be efficient in specific cases. Furthermore, a strong tendency exists among compilers of library booklists to by-pass non-book materials such as motion pictures, filmstrips, and audiotapes. They also list books that are out of print and do not provide acquisition cost estimates. Librarians proclaim worthy objectives but continue to produce lists with the same shortcomings. Consequently there are no lists that can be relied on to estimate library budgets or assure specific course coverage, such  as vocational technical, an area long neglected on library start-up lists. The author proposes a national committee to develop individual bibliographies for both transfer and terminal programs in junior colleges. Such master curricular resource lists composed of (1) books, (2) periodicals, (3) audiovisuals, and (4) general guidelines would have the advantages of (1) allowing libraries to be tailor-made for each college, (2) stressing quality over quantity of books, (3) focusing on curricular support, (4) allowing maximum use of budget and space, (5) promoting faculty, administrator, and librarian cooperation by allowing areas of mutual interest to develop, and (6) permitting creative cooperation to evolve.

Panel I dealt with foreign students and instructors, the possible use of retired foreign service personnel as lecturers, the difficulties of foreign students and how to help them, the need for education (especially technical) in the developing countries, and the advantages of student and faculty residence in a foreign country. Panel II, on vocational education, covered the advisability of giving it along with general education, its prestige in the professional hierarchy, and the selection of technical faculty. Panel III  looked at continuing education as an updating of the validity of an otherwise obsolete degree, noted the difficulty of articulating it with other programs, and pointed out that true community service is closely involved with the business and professional life of the region. Panel IV noted that interinstitutional cooperation, on both the instructional and community service levels, is financially and educationally economical, since more students can be accommodated with the same facilities and staff, and the various curricula can supplement, rather than supplant, compete with, or duplicate each other. Panel V covered the need for more, though specialized, research and publication by junior college teachers, to keep them both up to date and enthusiastic. (HH)",

Group I contained those enrolled in the remedial program; Group II, those in three or more academic/transfer courses. The groups were compared by GPA for four consecutive semesters, noting the attrition rate, and by seeking a significant difference in the GPA after two years. The validity of the comparison is limited by the fact that some students in the academic courses should probably have been in the remedial program and that the effect of withdrawals (especially of those with low GPAs) was not taken into account. Among the observations were: (1) the dropout rate was about the same  over two years; (2) Group I's GPA dropped between the first and fourth semester, Group II's increased; and (3) Group I students did not outperform those in Group II who should have taken, but did not take, the remedial courses. Although the exp&quot;riment did not show that the remedial program improved the students' basic skills, one possible conclusion is that those directed to the remedial program did no better or worse than those in the academic program who should have been so directed.

The product moment correlation between the Toledo scores and the final semester grades for these students was .42, significant at the .01 level. Regression equations were then used to establish guidelines for using this test in predicting success in chemistry. On the basis of these guidelines it can be said that, if a student receives a score greater than 54 on the Toledo exam, it is likely he will receive a C or better in the chemistry course; if his score is from 46 to 54, his chances of receiving  a C or better are equal to his chances of receiving a D or F; if he scores below 46, it is likely he will receive a D or F. As these are tentative guidelines, it is recommended that the score on the Toledo test be used only for student information until more adequate guidelines are established with continued use of the test.

Site development, equipment, fees, and a reserve fund would bring the total to $27,850,000. The tax rate to liquidate the bond issue over 25 years would average 11.2J (never rising above 11.9J). For two years after passage of the bond issue (1970-72), an average tax rate of 12.2J would have to be levied to lease facilities while the new campus was  being built, with an average rate of 11.8 for bond interest and redemption. Beginning with 1972-73, however, when the college moves to the new campus, the tax rate for such facilities would average 11.2J, an increase over the 1968-69 rate of only 1.3J. This average rate of 11.2J from 1972-73 contrasts with the increasing rate to lease temporary facilities, which will have risen by that year to 13.5J. Tax rate tables are appended. (HH)",

On the basis of their answers to a 37-item questionnaire, it was concluded that: (1) chances of the bond issue passing were excellent if a campaign was well-mounted, (2) stated intentions indicate 75% of those voting favored the issue, (3) an immediate election was not recommended, as those opposed to the issue were more certain of their intention than those in favor, (4) an educational campaign before the election would be beneficial, as  those familiar with the college were much more likely to favor the issue, (5) in light of community support for higher education, the number of pre-college-age children in the area for whom college plans had been made (nearly half for a two-year college), and the high regard for the college held by the community, the college was in an excellent position to wage such a campaign.

The lack of advanced degrees will show up in coming years. In general, the rate of immediate employment has gone up, as has the number going into military service. The demand for new graduates remains strong, 96% of them having definite job plans and most of the others considering offers. Of graduates from the non-accredited schools, even fewer are entering advanced study programs; most go directly into employment, continuing a trend of recent years. Tables show how many are employed (or entering graduate study) in the various engineering specialties. Information is also given for  the graduates of special institutions (industry schools and military and maritime academies) and for technology graduates from 2-year associate-degree programs and 4-year bachelor programs. The author regrets that many schools do not compile these data on their graduates, for such information as published in this Engineering Manpower Commission survey is useful to the engineering community.

Two measures of cognition, School and College Ability Test (SCAT) and Florida 12th Grade Battery, and three measures of the affective domain, Social Reaction Inventory (SRI) by Rotter, How I See Myself (HISM) by Gordon, and Study of Values (AVL) by Allport, Vernon, and Lindzey, were administered to the freshman class. Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations were computed for all variables. Stepwise multiple regression was then applied to determine the optional combination and weighing of predictions, with the increment in predictive efficiency at each step tested by analysis of  variance. The total score of each of the cognitive measures and the HISM teacher-school factor predicted significantly for all white students. For negro males, only the linguistic section of SCAT did as well. The HISM teacher-school factor and the AVL economic and social factors predicted at the .05 level for Negro females. For prediction, the junior college students are a heterogeneous population. The roles of cognitive and affective predictors are functions of race and sex. The relationship between affective factors and academic achievement is of great practical significance for curriculum development. (Author/HH)",

Findings show that although there are distinctive library needs at all levels in this sparsely populated area, institutional and regional self-sufficiency are impossible, and it will continue to be necessary to go outside the region for access to certain kinds of  research materials. Suggestions for library development to meet reference and research needs involve maximizing use of existing and potential regional resources through cooperative endeavors, while also coordinating these efforts with other 3-R systems and with expected statewide development such as centralized cataloging, computer-based union lists, and facsimile transmission.

Its organizational position in the Legislative Branch has not and need not inhibit its further development as a national library, but legislation to recognize its present &quot;de facto&quot; national-library role would be beneficial, as would a permanent commission on libraries and information to point up national needs and to advocate solutions and funding. Fifteen functions which the Library might expand or undertake, if it were recognized as the &quot;de jure&quot; national library and were  supported accordingly, are listed and suggestions regarding necessary action to enable the Library to carry out the expanded services are made. The most important proposals of the last decade for a national &quot;information system&quot; are outlined, and the distinction made in these proposals between libraries and library systems on the one hand and evaluation and retrieval systems on the other is rejected&quot; The Library sees the basic problem in an effective national library and information network as an access problem.

Users of the Annual Review differed from non-users in a number of ways, particularly on measures of professional activity level, where they were uniformly higher than the non-users. They reported a variety of valuable uses. The impact of the  Annual Review is already partially evident from the tendency of users to re-examine cited literature again, to seek new cited literature, and to seek contact with the authors of cited literature. Both the questionnaire and several informal interview sessions sought to elicit suggestions for improvement of the series. This study suggests that annual reviews have great potential for advancing many fields of inquiry and should, where possible, be encouraged and supported, preferably without demanding so precipitous a rate of growth toward self-support that the dilution in quality is ultimately self-defeating to the sponsoring organization.

        "description":"This study was designed to explore the practicality, flexibility, reliability, and sensitivity of the Criterion Group Method of measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of indexing, a method using a criterion group to set the standard for &quot;ideal&quot; indexing. These major variables were examined: (1) size of document sample, (2) size of Criterion Group, (3) instructions to indexers and use of a vocabulary guide, (4) three methods of editing raw indicia to make terms comparable, and (5) two methods of weighting indexers' scores. Scores earned by a set of eight professional indexers, by individual authors of the test documents and, in some cases, scores for title sets or medical students' indexing were compared within selected treatments to measure the extent to which the  detectability of differences was achieved by each treatment. A two-way analysis of variance was used to relate reliability of test scores to document sample size and criterion group size. From the results of these studies of the methodologic variables, it was concluded that the criterion group method of evaluating indexing can be a practical yardstick for a wide variety of managerial, research, and educational uses. Appendixes include the rationale of the method, a literature review, information on materials employed and subjects participating in study trials, and details on manual and computer implementation.

The purpose of this present study was to evaluate the first segment of the cataloging course which was used in three library science programs. The experiment involved four classes in cataloging and classification in which the control groups were taught by regular instructors and conventional lecture-laboratory methods and the experimental groups used the materials developed for independent study. These materials consisted of a programed text, an index, a  number of appendices, resumes of the materials programed, and a group of books assembled for use in the final session. It was concluded that: (1) the learning achievement of students using the independent study materials is sufficiently high to justify their use in teaching the same material now taught by conventional classroom methods, (2) students using the materials reacted favorably to them, and (3) retention of subject matter learned through independent study is not different from the retention of those students who had been taught in classroom situations. The attitude questionnaire showing student responses is appended. (JB)",

Advances in personnel management from the scientific management theory to the application of the \"human side of enterprise\" approach should be reflected in how library managers review personnel and operate their libraries. The work measurement and job description methods for establishing standards and evaluating employees are being discarded in favor of management by objectives. Closely allied to management by objectives is performance appraisal by results, a method of evaluation which involves the employee in a self-motivating and dynamic environment of commitment. Discussion and examples show that this performance appraisal technique is well suited for  both personnel and departmental management in special libraries. (JB)",

The results showed that in language ability, the Head Start children were significantly better able to be understood by their teacher and the examiner, to respond to their peers' questions, although not the teacher's, and to retell a simple story. In school readiness Head Start children were significantly more ready for school as measured by the Metropolitan Readiness Test, and they were significantly better able to give their full name and follow directions. In reaction to  school environment, Head Start children ranked significantly higher in participating in voluntary discussions, showing respect for each other, feeling at ease with their peers, feeling self-confident in school, asking questions about unclear directions, answering the examiner's questions, and telling personal experiences to the examiner. Head Start children showed only a tendency to feel the need to conform to regulations.

It has been assumed that dialectal differences contribute to difficulties in learning to read. Another question is whether a disadvantaged child who speaks a dialect is exposed to a language environment rich enough for him to make normal progress within that dialect. Preschool language programs have been trying to eliminate dialectual pronunciation difference so that children will be better prepared for the first grade. Although it is agreed that a social class prejudice against dialect exists, there is no agreement as to whether dialects reflecting substandard grammar are a hindrance to thinking processes. European children who speak regional dialects use standard  language at school without resulting learning deficits.

Maternal teaching variables examined included language, motivation techniques, ability to interpret child's responses, and success in giving appropriate feedback in return. The effects of teaching styles on children were also analyzed. Once the mothers understood the sorting tasks, they were given unlimited time to teach them to their children, although they were not supplied with methods. Task 1 required children to sort a group of toys by color and kind. Task 2 required block sorting by height, color and marking. Only 10 of the 162 children made perfect scores on the posttest. Results indicated that maternal variables of education, general intelligence, coercive or  encouraging teaching styles, and ability to motivate affected the child's performance, as did his own intelligence, interest in the tasks, and attitude toward the mother. The most successful teaching styles showed specificity of language and organization and sequential presentation of material to be learned.

The model is based on John Carroll's grammatical analysis and involves teaching children the skills of sentence transformation, sequencing, associating and categorizing. Since the children tend to speak in brief, telegraphic language, increased variety and control of verbal expression is a primary aim of the Hughes development model. Interesting curriculum activities, including trips and sensory experiences, are offered to provide stimuli to get children to talk. Verbal expression is elicited and reinforced by the teacher  and her technical assistants. The teacher, herself, gains understanding of language structure and models. The child's own language output, in the form of stories or conversation, is tape recorded and used both for analysis and to provide feedback to the child on his progress. Comparisons of language samples taken in the autumn and in the spring provide some measure of growth. The teacher prescribes for and talks to a child on the basis of his demonstrated individual needs. Specific examples of teaching procedures are given. (MS)",

        "description":"Ten normal 3-year-old children and their parents served as subjects for this longitudinal study of the interaction between parent-child relationships and the child's approach to task situations while attending nursery school. To illustrate the nature of the data gathered and observations made in this study, three of the 10 children were considered in some detail. The emphasis was on comparing the child's task behavior during nursery school to his relationship with his mother. These comparisons were made at the end of the first year of nursery school and again at the end of the second year of nursery school. The results indicated that it was important to look beyond the affection displayed by the mother towards her child to the whole context of the home environment in which the  mother-child relationship took place. That is, mothers who rate about the same in terms of providing adequate affection for their child may, because of other factors of the relationship or of the home context, establish different positive or negative behavioral characteristics in their child that would not be understandable without a more comprehensive awareness of the total mother-child relationship. Where mother to child warmth was adequate, where mother availability was well defined, where new relationships for the child were encouraged, where limits on behavior were set, and where achievement was encouraged, the child demonstrated a more stable personality and a superior approach to task behavior.

Experiments in contingency management and the establishment of requisite antecedent behaviors such as sitting, listening, etc. necessary for preschool activities are being conducted. The Center's operation is based on the theory that verbal behavior as well as other behaviors can be engineered when supportive consequences are contingent upon production of desired behavior. A behavior is introduced to an individual child in a special setting by a teacher. Once the desired behavior has been learned, the child is returned to the\"natural\" playroom setting where it has been demonstrated that he will again repeat the learned behavior without additional instruction.

In interviews, 200 Negro mothers indicated satisfaction with the educational experiences in Head Start, especially socialization of children. Interviewees felt that the mother role was important. They expressed the most common problems at home as either disciplinary or economic. Mothers perceived themselves as the most important influence on their children; teachers were a close second. Formal learning took place in school, and mothers depended on no significant community agencies for help in the education of their children. Although 73 percent aspired to a college education for their children, only 23 percent thought it would be a reality. Choosing  well-known men as models for emulation for their sons, mothers selected civil rights workers of high standards, morals, and courage; and for daughters, mothers selected women of talent, achievement, and positive personality. When asked about models they had actually known, the respondents stressed positive values of economically responsible male roles and maternally responsible female roles.

The disadvantaged preschool children functioned intellectually and verbally below their middle class peers and were 8 months behind them in language development. Longitudinal data indicate that children who have had preschool training scored higher on test batteries in the first grade, that their language development is superior, and that their academic achievement and attitudes toward learning are significantly higher. Early education intervention is valuable to the development of self-confidence and greater trust in their environment.  These children scored higher on dependency on teachers, on aggression, and on achievement striving than did children without preschool training.

The scales were expanded so that 7,551 second graders were randomly assigned to one of six possible test situations . Factor analysis of the original TASC for each sex revealed four factors, three of which were replicated on a factor analysis of the expanded TASC. None of the factors were interpreted as clearly defining response set. The four factors were used as  subscales in a two-way multivariate analysis to test the race and sex effect. All four subscales contributed to the race effect, while the overall sex effect was due to the white sample only. When results were compared to total TASC scores, the effects proved significant. The following conclusions and directions were made: (1) acquiescent response set is not a major source of variance in TASC, (2) multidimensionality of the scale orients researchers to focus on childrens' anxiety responses to school situations, and (3) it would be difficult to use the interdependent subscales as differentiating correlates of TASC.

Forty-eight Head Start children, divided into four groups, were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: echoic prompting (children  listened to and echoed each sentence in every lesson); parallel prompting (children listened to a sentence for the first picture and, using this as a model, produced the sentence for the second picture); listening only (no overt response); and control (pretests and posttests with no special instruction). The results supported only the first hypothesis significantly. Evidence shows, however, that children who listen to, echo or model well formed sentences have a facility to produce appropriate sentences when compared to children who are not so exposed. (JS)",

Their mothers' education consisted of elementary, secondary, or college level achievement. Items from the Merrill-Palmer Scale and the Guilford model were selected and tested for ability to identify thinking activities. A factor analysis identified six specific types of thinking: two convergent, two divergent, one cognitive, and one maturational. For 4- to 5-year-olds, sex differences were relatively insignificant. Age differences were  significantly related to the convergent, cognitive, and maturational abilities, but not to the divergent type. The mothers' education was related to four of the six abilities, and the area of residence was related to three of the six abilities.

A current explanation posits that the shift is an adaptive response by the young child to classroom stimuli, which stresses attention to form. In order to test this hypothesis, 120 children (5- and 6-year-olds) of lower socioeconomic status were given a stimulus preference text. Sixty of these children were enrolled in Head Start classes; the others were eligible but were not enrolled in school. Twenty of the Head Start subjects were Anglo, 20 were Negro, and 20 were Indian. The same was true for the nonschool group. The test was given at several points during the school year, and it was expected that at the first testing of each group  there would be no difference in the number of form responses given. On the final testing, however, it was expected that the school group would respond to form significantly more often than the nonschool group. The results confirmed the hypothesis: school children showed a steady increase in form responses across the school year, while the nonschool children did not. Analysis of race showed that Negro school children shifted from color to form much slower than did Anglo and Indian school children. Twenty-seven tables or graphs and a bibliography are included.

Teachers were grouped according to their years of teaching experience and type of experience; i.e., general or with the culturally deprived. Results by analysis of variance indicated significant differences between groups of teachers on variables measuring teachers' perceptions of the effectiveness and acceptance of Head Start, their awareness of the effects of cultural deprivation, their perceptions of their success as  Head Start teachers, and a comparison of Head Start and non-Head Start children from similar environments. Generally, the more general the experience, the more stable and positive were the teacher attitudes. The same was true with teachers with no experience or six or more years of specific experience. Due to cognitive traces from previous experience, experienced teachers had greater insight into problem areas and could more easily incorporate new experiences with the culturally deprived.

The subjects consist of 240 Negro males from all social levels in Manhattan. Half of them are 2 years old and half are 3 years old. Subjects were assigned to an individual instructor in either a training group (where they were taught concepts) or a discovery group (where they had free play) for 2 hours a week. In addition, a control group of 70 children are being seen for assessment purposes only. All children were pretested and are measured annually. After 2 years of the program, the results indicated that up to age three social class is not a function of performance; from ages  three to eight differences are present but insignificant; the experimental children perform better than the control children; the effect s of the program received at age two last at least 1 year; and both experimental groups produce equally well. The results imply that early training may be beneficial, provided it is systematic, is uninterrupted, and occurs at least 2 hours a week with a one-to-one teacher-pupil ratio. (JS)",

Twenty-five 4- and 5-year-old preschool children participated in a prediction experiment in which a stack of cards (each card alternately having a patch of red or green tape on it) was displayed to the child. The child was presented with a card and asked to predict the color on the next card. Two interval lengths, a long and a short, were used between presentation and prediction. The subject's performance, it was thought, was affected by (1) memory of each trial, (2) effects of the previous response, (3) lagging of attention, (4) guessing, and (5) the variation in interval length. The results from 100 trials indicated that the probability of an error, given a correct response on the previous trial,  is greater following the long interval than following the short. It was also found that the probability of an error, given a correct response, is less than or equal to both the probability of a correct response, given an error, and the probability of an error, given an error. The theoretical basis of this task is being used to develop a recall task similar in form to the prediction task. (WD)",

        "description":"In a 1964 investigation of the effects of age and memory on problem solving, using subjects from age three to age nineteen, it was found that the youngest and oldest subjects performed a three-choice probabilistic task significantly different from the &quot;middle-age&quot; children (7 to 9 years old). The three-choice task was an apparatus with a signal light, three buttons, and a container into which marbles were dispensed for &quot;correct&quot; responses. Only one button was set up to release a marble, and even it was on a partial reinforcement schedule. The younger and older subjects tended to maximize their choice of the &quot;pay-off&quot; button. The middle-age children tended to respond in simple patterns regardless of the fact that such patterns did not increase the pay-off. It was thought that this  result interfered with their memory in regard to which button was paying off. A later study, in which a memory aid was used for half of the subjects, was conducted. It was found that the younger and older subjects performed about the same as before, regardless of the existence of the memory aid. The 7- and 9-year-olds who used the aid performed significantly better than those who did not. A third study, similar to the previous studies except that four different reinforcement schedules were used, indicated that responses become more complex with age. (WD)",

However, a method was needed to analyze the vocalizations of infants. This report describes a method used to analyze the vocal behavior of infants in their prelinguistic stage, from birth to 4 months. The method was based on the \"distinctive features\" concept. Eight distinctive features of infant vocalization were coded by observers. This data yielded information on the quality and frequency of infant vocal behavior and provided a measure of individual differences between prelinguistic infants. Data have been collected on forty 3-day-old  infants. This eight-feature coding scheme has proven to be reliable. (WD)",

This data was then processed by new electro-acoustic techniques. In processing one hundred and eight 95-second vocal behavior samples, the computer determined (1) the number of utterances, (2) the duration of each utterance, and (3) the mean and standard deviation of the fundamental  frequency and amplitude of each utterance.

Russian, for example, is sufficiently different from English to serve as a useful contrast. Early syntactic development is very much the same in both languages. A small class of \"pivot words\" and a larger open class of words are used first. Word order is quite inflexible at each of the early stages of syntactic development. Two-word sentences appear at about 1:8 (1 year, 8 months); three- or four-word sentences appear at about 1:10. Morphological markers enter with the three- and four-word sentences. The learning of morphology goes on longer than the learning of syntactic patterns. A major Russian work on language development  contends that the Russian child does not master his morphology until several years beyond the age at which the American child completes his primary grammatical learning. This factor suggests that it may be more difficult to learn to speak one language natively than another, although in both, basic learning is accomplished rapidly. (WD)",

Each stage was about 4- or 5-months long, starting at the 18th to 28th month, depending upon the child's level of linguistic ability. The interrogative structures of primary interest were (1) intonation patterns, (2) auxiliary inversion, (3) negation, (4) WH word (what, who, why, etc.) placement, and (5) tag questions. At stage one, inflections, auxiliaries, articles, and most pronouns were absent. The child used intonation to mark a question. There were no yes-or-no questions and only a few WH questions. There were no tag questions. The child at this stage did not appear to understand  the interrogatory structure when he heard it. At stage two, articles, pronouns, and negative preverb forms appeared. Auxiliaries were still not present, nor were tag questions. Stage three included the emergence of the use of auxiliaries, auxiliary inversion, and the do transformation. Inversion and transformation were found in yes-or-no questions but were absent in WH questions. Tag questions were still absent, but the children understood and responded well to questions. An appendix of sample questions obtained from the subjects at each stage is included. (WD)",

Therefore, subjects chosen for this research project were people who had been trained in experiential recall. During recall the subjects spontaneously reported what appeared to be auditory components of a complex conditioning situation related to birth or speech and neonatal environment. These auditory components were then correlated with the speech and somatic symptomatology observed in the subjects. It was concluded that prenatal or neonatal trauma may contribute to later neural disorganization and functional psychopathology. This result supports the hypothesis that when the birth experience is traumatic, there is a tendency to establish  potentially pathogenetic responses. If subsequent experiences reinforce the tendency by approximating the traumatic variables, such conditioning may lead to various forms of psychopathology. Also, words heard by an infant before he understands speech may affect his learning later. (WD)",

Hypotheses were formulated and tested with regard to the family functions of social-psychological support, economic support, and communication with relatives in other communities. When family members or relatives performed these functions, planning by youth to migrate was significantly more likely than when no family member performed these functions. Migration planning was also more likely when both family systems, rather than one, performed  the functions. Little confirmation was given to the proposition that the immediate family was more important than other relatives in effecting plans to migrate. It was emphasized that while attachment to the immediate family was a barrier to migration, family support could overcome its effects. (SW)",

Farm boys had higher aspirations than non-farm boys, while aspirations of farm and non-farm girls did not differ significantly. Both findings contradicted prior research findings. The educational aspirations of farm boys appeared to be less realistic than those of non-farm boys.

Results from both studies indicated that relatively deprived farm operator households were: (1) composed of more older people; (2) disproportionately non-white (though the larger proportion was white); (3) educationally disadvantaged; and (4) concentrated in certain regions of the country. Evidence suggested that these disadvantaged families were appropriate recipients of anti-poverty aid, but due to large variations in farm operator households any economic or social development program for farm operator families should be carefully  designed to include only those in need to avoid antagonizing those families above average in their annual incomes.

Questionnaires and interviews supplied the data from a randomly selected representative group of 74 mothers out of almost 300 involved.

The school has 3 possible avenues for action in correcting low school and societal achievement: (1) change the child, (2) change the school, or (3) change the social systems. Responsibility for such changes is passed on to the teachers. However, the teachers' failure to understand the interrelationships between culture, society, personality, and behavior often impedes this change. Thus, teacher improvement, in addition to other institutional changes, can contribute to raised Mexican American group status. Changes must occur in present teacher preparation programs, in teachers, and in schools. Cooperation between schools  and teacher preparation institutions can produce changes which will ultimately trickle down to the real clients--children. (SW)",

Results of several value scales administered to both Mexican American and Anglo junior high, senior high, and college students indicate that Mexican American students agree with authoritarian ideology to a significantly higher degree than do Anglo students. This is attributed to rearing in a family atmosphere emphasizing father domination, strict child rearing practices, submission and obedience to the will of authority figures, strict separation of sex roles, and relationships based on dominance and submission. Evidence indicates that Mexican Americans express attitudes toward education that are  significantly more unfavorable than those of Anglos. Moreover, value orientations developed in the homes of Mexican Americans are contradicted by the value system of the schools. The study concludes that Mexican Americans' adjustment to school is being hindered by their avoidance reaction to school tasks and school personnel. Preparation programs designed to introduce teachers to practical uses of anthropological methods are seen as a beneficial factor toward increasing teacher sensitivity to Mexican American problems.

Understanding what is read is basic to any aspect of learning, but the learner should be prepared to go beyond mere understanding and to use information gained to further enrich his experiences and knowledge through critical analysis, creative interpretation, retention, and functional reading. To help the learner develop these abilities, the following keys are suggested for instructional emphasis: perception, communication, vocabulary, interest, and utility. The learner needs an adequate accumulation of percepts and a rich experiential background from which to draw concepts and understandings. He needs help in bringing meaning to and getting meaning from the reading material. He  needs an expanding vocabulary and reading materials filled with interest-arousing situations which challenge him to discover the more subtle meanings and inferences of the author. He needs to know the importance of reading as a tool of learning in all areas of the curriculum. Then he will be free to read. (NS)",

Maturation, heredity, and experience influences readiness, and most 6-year-olds are ready to learn something about reading. Readiness research should attempt to find what and how a child is ready to learn rather than whether he is ready to learn to read. Recommendations for improved research caution against interpreting the findings of readiness studies when the teaching method and materials are not specified, particularly when the sample is small. Researchers should avoid making misleading retrospective inferences about readiness, especially in the case of inferences of no relationship. Finally, one should not make the following faulty interpretations  of correlational relationships: (1) assuming that correlational differences due to individual test suitability differences or to test reliability differences imply differences in the relationship of the underlying variables; (2) neglecting to analyze the nature of various readiness tasks and to use this information in future research regardless of the names presently given to the tasks; and (3) overlooking the importance of sampling error in multivariate analyses.

        "description":"This research was done to determine whether formal kindergarten training in alphabet and number names would result in a higher reading level for children at the end of grade 1. As part of an earlier research project, two classes of primarily middle-class kindergarten children received 8 weeks of training in alphabet and number names. Two control classes participated in the regular informal kindergarten program. Preliminary analyses at the beginning of grade 1 showed that the experimental group responded to the training with a higher level of number and letter recognition than the control group. The followup study involved an analysis of The Metropolitan Achievement Test subtest scores and the reading subtest scores of the Wide Range Achievement Test which were administered at the  end of grade 1. Statistical analyses measured the differential impact of the experimental procedure separately for boys and girls on scores of the Draw-a-Man Test and the Gates Reading Readiness Test, administered as pretest, post-test-I, and post-test-II. The beneficial effects of kindergarten training were dissipated by the end of grade 1. The use of reading readiness tests for individual prediction of first-grade achievement was concluded to be risky. The complete project proposal and statistical data are appended. (CM)",

Analyzed were (1) the practice teaching experience in these institutions, (2) the methods courses in science education, and (3) the characteristics of the instructors of these methods courses. Some 992 institutions were surveyed and 73 per cent of these returned at least a partial response. The two-part questionnaire was directed both to the person responsible for the overall program and to the instructors of the methods courses in the institution. Over 90 tables present information obtained in the survey. (GR)",

Goals of the conference were to produce action resolutions and recommendations which, when implemented, would (1) be effective in improving the science and mathematics curricula reaching the elementary school pupil, and (2) bring about integration of teaching of mathematics and science in the elementary school classroom.  Specifically considered were the curriculum, the preservice and inservice training of teachers, and the capacity of American public school systems to respond to a changing curriculum. Several recommendations and guidelines for action were developed relating specifically to school administrators, classroom teachers, supervisors, and college and university personnel. (GR)",

An ordered combination of two teaching approaches--the concrete inductive and the abstract deductive--was used for the two sequential topics involving the limit and the derivative concepts. All four possible pairings for the two units were considered and constituted the four experimental treatments. Specifically, the problem in this study was to determine if there were a statistically significant difference in the four treatments. Programed units were used to control the teacher variable. The units were read by advanced high school mathematics students, who were divided into  high and low achievers on the basis of pretest scores. Contrary to the pilot study and related research results, when a difference in teaching methods existed in the derivative and total treatment studies, the deductive method was favored. Further correlation and regression analyses revealed that a student's prior mathematical knowledge, a&quot; measured by the pretest and limit test, was the determining factor in predicting the limit and derivative test scores, even though the deductive treatment was found to be superior.

The evaluation's primary population consisted of teachers of the disadvantaged (in Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico) who had volunteered for Title I training during the 1966-67 school year; the three adjunct populations were teachers who had volunteered for Title I training during the 1965-66 school year, instructional leaders of 1966-67 inservice projects, and  school district consultants who had had Title I training during the 1966-67 school year. Semantic differential was used to measure the evaluative, potency, and activity dimensions of meaning; one projective and four nonprojective instruments were correlate measures. F and t tests were applied to the data. It was found that Title I training of teachers during the 1966-67 school year did effect attitudinal differences, there were no attitudinal differences between teachers who had had Title I training in 1965-66 and those who had had training, and Title I training of consultants was not accompanied by attitudinal change.

Phase 1 is a noncoursed, integrated presentation of academic content. After being pretested, a student and a counselor (one of a team of instructors) select from the syllabus those learning activities which will help the student exhibit terminal performance specified in  each objective. Each student is teamed with one or two others in his subject matter specialty, and together they write behavioral objectives and design and prepare learning activities and pre- and posttest instruments (some of these materials completely programed) to be used when they student teach. During this period they observe in the classroom in which they will student teach as a team (Phase 2 of the program). Students do microteaching to improve needed teaching behaviors and perform interaction analysis of their own and others' teaching sessions.

An introductory chapter delineates the assumptions on which the proposed program is based, generally describes the development of the specifications, and explains their organization. The specifications, each of them concerned with implementing a behavioral objective, are presented in five groups, one for each educational context considered of major importance to the formulation of a teacher education program: instructional organization, educational technology, contemporary  learning-teaching process, societal factors, and research. Each group is then divided into a number of major subject areas which, in turn, are divided into topics. The specifications under each topic include (1) behavioral objectives (and designation of the target population to which it can be applied), (2) the treatment needed to accomplish each objective, (3) materials required (both general types and major published sources), (4) techniques to be used in evaluating the accomplishment of the objective.

        "description":"&quot;Video Processes Are Changing Teacher Education&quot; by Howard Bosley (the first of five papers comprising this document) discusses the Multi-State Teacher Education Project (M-STEP) experimentation with media; it lists various uses of video processes, concentrating specifically on microteaching and the use of simulation and critical incidents materials. A paper by Clark Webb and others of Brigham Young University describes a large-scale microteaching program, depicting a typical session and discussing equipment, facilities, logistics, and evaluation. A companion paper by Clark Webb and Hugh Baird presents the results of &quot;a limited investigation into the potential of a super 8mm cartridge film for brief (3-10 minute) model teaching episodes.&quot; Attached are lists of approximate costs  of selected pieces of equipment and of representative processes and manufacturing companies. &quot;Developing a State's Resources for Television in Teacher Education&quot; by G.W. Hopkins reports the South Carolina M-STEP program's problems, organizational structure, and progress; it includes a list of tapes and accompanying study guides (plus corollary publications) prepared for use in that program and &quot;available for use.&quot; In the final paper Bosley presents &quot;An Appraisal&quot; of various video processes as viewed by participants in the M-STEP experiment.

        "description":"Simulation may be defined as (1) a technique of modeling (physically, iconically, verbally, or mathematically) some aspects of a real or proposed system, process, or environment or (2) the model (physical, iconic, verbal, or mathematical) of some aspects of a real or proposed system, process, or environment. Simulation may be used to generate information (research); generate new objects, processes, or systems (development); or develop knowledge of skills (instruction). When used for instruction, simulation represents certain elements of real life minus task-irrelevant elements. Given the types of representation of the stimulus situation, the response, and the feedback, classification of \"simulations\" or \"simulators\" is possible. Simulation may be used to present information  (referential simulation), elicit responses (contextual response simulation), or assess performance (criterion simulation). Four features characterize contextual response simulation: (1) enacted or lifelike responses are made to (2) nonreal stimulus situations that (3) provide feedback to the student vis-a-vis his behavior in the on-going context that (4) offers control. Transfer and motivation are additional factors to be considered. From simulations it is possible to learn winning strategies, principles and relationships, decision-making skills, identifications, procedural sequences, and skilled perceptual-motor acts.

        "description":"In 1961, Teaching Research Division of Oregon State System of Higher Education began developing a variety of simulated classroom situations through the medium of sound motion pictures and printed materials. It has been testing this technique which permits a supervising teacher to control the stimulus events in the classroom via simulated experience, forcing a teacher trainee to focus on a situation and devise different modes of responding. Instructional simulation offers the trainee an opportunity to build his own strategies of searching for cues that signal a decision-making process on his part, to test hypotheses he has about how to respond to these problems, and to change his behavior in view of the feedback he receives. Findings from the first four years of research suggest  that realism and prompting are not important variables in enhancing transfer of training in comparison with instructor differences and possibly length of training. Initial evidence indicates that there is transfer of learning from simulated to real experience, but much remains to be learned about how simulation best works. A project is under way to produce low-cost simulation packages (original materials required expensive laboratory facilities and equipment) that may be adapted for self-instructional or group use as well as for the tutorial method now used. (Appended is a description of the materials so far developed, the instructional procedures employed in using time, and the facilities required.) (JS)",

In the first phase, to last four weeks, trainees learn basic job skills through such methods as role playing and job simulation and acquire an understanding of their change-agent roles in the particular agencies involved. In Phase 2, a four-week transitional period, trainees work half day on the job and participate in group discussion of work experiences and problems during the other half of the day. In the third phase, which could last up to two years, trainees work on the job four days a week and receive special training on the fifth day. Upgrading of necessary core  skills, high school equivalency work, or advanced educational training might comprise this fifth day, or the time might be used in preparation for a shift to a different job in another agency. A training director, an associate director, four service trainers, and four to eight assistant trainers are trained (partly at a preservice training laboratory and partly inservice) in knowledge of tasks to be performed by nonprofessionals, learning styles of low-income populations, agency structure and tradition, and methodology and training design. Preservice training for trainees must be phased, however, to make optimum use of the number of trainers. (SG)",

        "description":"The Community Apprentice Program, developed by the Howard University Center for Youth and Community Studies, was an exploratory attempt, through combined rehabilitation, vocational education, and supervised work experience, to train disadvantaged youth as human service aides in child care, recreation, and social research. Seven boys and three girls, ranging in age from 16 to 20, who were currently unemployed and lacked education beyond high school were selected. The 12-week program consisted of three related parts: the &quot;core group,&quot; in which members learned to analyze personal, social, and job-related problems, make decisions, and relate more effectively to others; specialty workshops and seminars; and supervised on-the-job experience. Consisting of experimentation with data  gained from observation and tape recordings and attempts to develop instruments for more refined and controlled future studies, evaluation of the project focused on delineation of the characteristics of the youths who volunteered for the program, analysis of reasons for their identification and affiliation with or alienation from the program, and description and evaluation of the group process. (Also included are comments of aides, results, curriculum outlines, sample position descriptions, and a 19-item bibliography.) (SG)",

Eight junior elementary education majors who volunteered for the program work for three or four hours a day with teachers to whom they are assigned as aides or interns. They perform housekeeping and clerical duties and receive special help as they observe and teach those subjects and activities for which they receive college credit: in the fall quarter handwriting and physical education, in the winter quarter reading and science, in the spring  quarter health and arithmetic. Two university professors who direct the program visit each student in the classroom situation and hold weekly seminars with the entire group; specialists in science, reading, mathematics, and health work with them in both observations and seminars. Throughout the same year, students take regularly scheduled courses at the University: foundations in reading, introduction to education, child psychology, music for classroom teachers, educational psychology, and psychology of personality development. They will do fifteen quarter hours of student teaching in their senior year. It is too early to evaluate the program. (JS)",

        "description":"Sensitivity training is one type of experience-based learning in which participants work together in a small group over an extended period of time learning through analysis of their own experiences. The primary setting is the T Group (T for training) in which a staff member sets up an ambiguous situation which allows participants to choose the roles they will play while observing and reacting to the behavior of other members and in turn having an impact on them. The perceptions and reactions are the data for learning. T-Group theory emphasizes each participant's responsibility for his own learning, the staff person's role of facilitating examination and understanding, provision for detailed examination required to draw valid generalizations, creation of authentic interpersonal  relationships which facilitate honest and direct communication, and the development of new skills in working with people. Goals of sensitivity training are to allow participants to gain a picture of the impact that they make on others and to facilitate the study of group dynamics and of larger organizational concepts such as status, influence, division of labor, and styles of managing conflict. Research on sensitivity training is rather scarce and often subject to serious methodological problems, but some generalizations can be supported.

A panel of five judges categorized 1500 &quot;difficult&quot; classroom situations gathered from teachers, and built the 30-item Classroom Situation Questionnaire which was administered to 173 teachers with varying lengths of experience. The judges classified their responses to the situations in terms of the diminishing-interruptive vs. the non-diminishing, non-interruptive dimension of classroom behavior (i.e., the extent to which teaching  behavior was interruptive of the learning process because it diminished the self-concept of students, class, or teacher). Analyses of variances did reveal response differences, with the most productive teacher behaviors occurring at the third and between the sixth and tenth years of service. The experimental course was given to 156 teachers; 30 not enrolled were a control group. Analyses of variance of repeated measures resulted in F ratios indicative of significant differential effects between the two groups beyond the .01 level, with the experimental group changing positively, the control group negatively.

        "description":"The Off Campus Methods Course (OCMC), devised to relate closely the theory of methods courses to actual teaching experience, consists of three episodes (teaching map and globe skills, using a questioning strategy, and individualizing instruction), each comprised of four phases. In the theoretical phase, an education professor teaches the strategy to be used in a particular teaching episode. In the demonstrational phase, preservice teachers observe a demonstration teacher using the same strategy to teach a lesson. In the applicational phase, preservice teachers and cooperating teachers plan a microteaching experience, and the preservice teachers teach the lesson. In the analytical phase, preservice teachers and their professors analyze the microteaching experiences, which have  been recorded on video tape. OCMC offers certain advantages. Preservice teachers can immediately apply the educational theory they learn, and they have earlier opportunities (junior year in college) for contact with children in actual classroom settings. Moreover, using preservice teachers in inner city classrooms provides children with increased opportunities to interact with and respond to adults. After a six-week pilot run of OCMC (35 preservice teachers in six elementary school classes) at Lagrange School in Toledo, Ohio, participants agreed that OCMC had made a worthwhile contribution to their preservice preparation. Future trial of OCMC is planned. (SG)",

Integrated into the system are (1) defined verbal and nonverbal dimensions; (2) categories reflecting the personal, content, and institutional aspects of classroom tasks; (3) categories designed to permit encoding on purely behavioral evidence; and (4) categories which are few in number, symmetrical, and easy to use. Categories were developed from three key concepts about teaching: (1) Both teachers and students have classroom roles; these include, for teachers, an institutional or  control role, a knowledge conveyance role, or a role as developer for student personalities, and for students, a learner role or a role as a developing personality. (2) The interaction process is the sum of verbal and nonverbal events, usually in some combination. (3) Work with Flanders' Interaction Analysis System has demonstrated the desirability of maintaining the direct-indirect teaching concept. Preliminary work with Mini-TIA has demonstrated that the system is functional and effective in focusing the attention of education students on key behaviors. Also, Mini-TIA permits statistical computation of observational data. (SG)",

        "description":"Research into teacher nonverbal behavior is needed. Although teachers are usually aware of their verbal behavior, they may be unaware of many nonverbal cues they express through gesture, facial expression, posture, vocal tone, or similar mechanisms. Such nonverbal expressions convey attitudes and impressions which may affect the teaching-learning process and may be of particular importance in the acculturation of minority group children. A model of communication consists of (1) a sender, (2) a message, (3) a channel, and (4) a receiver. A model of a teacher's nonverbal communication behavior ranges from encouraging to restricting and can be schematized according to six pairs of antithetical characteristics: (1) congruous-incongruous, (2) responsive-unresponsive, (3) positively  affective-negatively affective, (4) attentive-inattentive, (5) facilitative-unreceptive, and (6) supportive-disapproving. The effects of nonverbal communication may be brought about through such events as use of space, teacher travel, use of time, and control maneuvers. Unlike verbal communication, nonverbal communication does not easily provide feedback. Consequently, greater awareness of nonverbal communication plus greater awareness of student behavior is necessary on the part of the teacher. In training teachers, feedback on nonverbal behavior may be provided through awareness of student reaction and response, observational data, or video tape analysis. (SG)",

        "description":"For a one-semester study it was hypotnesized that a team-taught group of students enrolled in an introductory course in education would achieve higher scores than traditionally taught students and that the students' decision to become teachers was independent of the teaching method employed. An experimental group, consisting of 78 students combined into one class, was taught by a team of three teachers. A control group of 55 students was divided into two sections, one taught by a team instructor and one by a regular instructor. The data of the control group was combined to minimize teacher variability. A standard examination was administered with a check list to determine the influence that the course had on the students' decision to become teachers. Statistical analysis of the  data indicated that students taught by the team achieved significantly higher scores than did those in the control group. Also, the check list revealed that the teaching approach used did not influence the students' decision to become teachers. Teacher variability in the control group, the major limitation of the study, might have been reduced by using the team instructors for both control sections. (Author/SM)",

Teacher performance behaviors and a teacher job analysis provided the foundation on which the model was built. System analysis was the technique utilized for the program. The rationale for the development of the model was based on the hypothesis that an effective teacher education program is built upon the job which the teacher performs. The sequential development of goals, objectives, and pupil learning behaviors for the elementary school provided a primary basis for ascertaining teaching behaviors and, consequently, analyzing teacher jobs at four levels: teacher aide, teaching assistant, elementary teacher, and specialist. Finally, teacher  performance specifications were developed that provide the objectives and content for the program. The project produced performance specifications for teacher competencies plus specifications for the selection of candidates, for program evaluation, and for implementation of the program including individualized curriculum guides (proficiency modules), laboratory facilities, orientation program, and extensive administration reorganization.

Factor analytic procedures identified ten television teacher traits: communicative ability, stimulation, control, assertiveness, composure, dynamism, friendliness, wit, profundity, and intimacy. The teacher was rated higher on the factors of intimacy and assertiveness on television than in the classroom. The television presentation eliminated differences in  teacher ratings due to student seating. The teacher achieved identical mood complexes over television and in the classroom. Two professors were rated higher on many factors than their colleagues but these variations occurred independently of other variables. Significant correlations were obtained (1) between student personality characteristics and reports of mood before and after television lessons and (2) between postlesson moods and teacher traits. Major changes in affective behavior occurred during experimental lectures, but the mood changes occurred independently of student personality characteristics.

A questionnaire was used to gather background information about 255 freshmen and sophomores in the teacher education program at Wisconsin State University, Oshkosh, identified as being on academic probation or having been dismissed for academic reasons; 12 volunteers from this group were selected for a summer session pilot study. Through a University-Wide Representative Council, curriculum  revisions based on identified student weaknesses in general education, professional education, and specialization were developed and incorporated into a program including a personal development seminar, individualized activities at a special learning center, and paid work experience. It was found that students developed more positive attitudes and were effective as paraprofessionals after short-term training sessions.

Points of entry into the program differ, depending on an individual's prior training and experience. Guidance permits varied  coursework and varied rate of completion of the necessary 32 learning units. In the clinical setting, guidance procedures call for extending individualization beyond the learning of concepts and skills into the development of competencies in self-direction, inquiry, and personal-social characteristics.

In 1912, Robert Lenz published collections of Chilean stories and stated that they were highly suitable as children's reading matter. Thus, Lenz laid the foundations for a native Chilean children's literature. His collections, and others made by prominent foklorists, inspired numerous publications. The tales of Blanca Santa Cruz, for instance, are written in a clear and pithy style and retain the formulae for openings (&quot;There was once upon a time . . . once upon a time there was&quot;) and the &quot;chacharachas&quot; or &quot;rhyming prattle&quot; of the conclusions. Ernesto Montenegro combines his interest in foklore with his talents as a creative  writer in the production of his superior collections. Looking toward the future, Antonio Acevedo Hernandez indicates that such adventures as the exploration of the Amazon River could also be used as the basis for young people's books. (JS)",

Some of the generalizations in linguistics (e.g., the articulatory description of differences between significant sounds, of the classification of parts of speech by form and function) do not hold true in every instance; nevertheless, the methods used by linguists to investigate problems are valuable and can be used with elementary students. For example, to work with the many problems of classification in language, children can be taught that the criteria for classifying items must be of the same order and tht the resulting classification scheme must be significant in some way.  Examples of criteria which can be used advantageously are (1) numbers of syllables, (2) consonant-vowel groups, (3) spelling and sound relationships, and (4) parts of speech. By making such classifications, the children will learn not only methods of investigating problems and formulating theories but also a great deal about English grammar and the nature of language in general.

For this most \"teachable\" moment to be fully utilized, it should be scheduled early in the school day while out-of-school experiences are still fresh in the children's minds.

This interrelation should be stressed in each grade, with increasing specilization from junior high school through college, at which point a review of basic integrations is particularly necessary for prospective teachers. The teaching of English as a discipline is not accomplished  through curriculums which separate composition and literature, for instance, or classes designed with particular emphases; but rather through concentration on utilitarian, artistic, and imaginative uses of language, composition, and literature, and through the teacher's responsiveness to new materials, new methods, research, and experimentation.

Because they lacked speed and had spelling difficulties, the children were assisted by sixth-grade students acting as secretaries. Both grades benefited from this experience. Having grown more confident, the second-graders began writing on their own, and the sixth-graders became more aware of correct spelling and sentence structure. (SW)",

Two classes were used as control groups, and two as experimental groups. Teachers of both groups participated in the planning sessions to prepare 14 lessons with materials. Instruction in the use of the dictionary and opportunities for written work were equal in both groups; but instruction in the experimental group emphasized proofreading techniques and involved the use of common-sounds spelling charts and a modification of Dolch's \"check-guess\" technique. After completing the 14-lesson program, students in both groups wrote stories from which the percent of spelling error was computed for each  child's paper. For the experimental group, the time allocated for writing the story included the opportunity to proofread before the assignment was collected. Results indicated that boys who were taught the techniques of check-guessing and proofreading in spelling made significantly fewer errors than those who did not receive such instruction (evidence regarding girls was not conclusive), and that instruction in the use of the dictionary must be specifically directed toward the correction of spelling errors in order to be effective.

Censorship of books by both individuals and pressure groups can be avoided or dealt with through a program which has been carefully prepared before any censorship attempt occurs. The first step should be selection of the book by several teachers familiar with the community and the students. Then, the reasons for the book's inclusion in the curriculum should be disseminated through the school system and should be made available to the community through news outlets, PTA meetings, and other avenues of communication. Thus, a general unity of purpose is fostered among teachers, and reasonable discussion is encouraged between  teachers and community leaders. When censorship attempts do occur, the school should first consider whether or not the book is being taught in a sensational manner. If it is not, the school should then present to the censor the questions raised in the NCTE pamphlet, \"Citizen's Request for the Reconsideration of a Book.\" Also, offering a choice of titles to a single class will not only provide for individual reading differences but also discourage the objector who claims that his child is forced to read one particular book.

For the evaluation, 23 randomly selected teachers were interviewed to determine their understanding of program objectives, their actual classroom use of pattern drills, and the effectiveness of inservice training. Analysis of data showed that teachers were unable to identify valid program objectives and that discrepancies existed between  recommended time allotments and actual classroom practice. No appreciable changes in teachers' attitudes or procedures resulted from the inservice training. At the time of this progress report, the Program is faced with two further tasks of evaluation: the development of suitable instruments for measuring student achievement and the reexamination of teachers' attitudes and practices.

As a first step in the project, a 3-week summer class for 38 eighth-grade youngsters was conducted on the campus of Cornell University. Some of the experiments conducted in the class included altering the teacher's role, varying working conditions, and determining factors involved in art appreciation. The second step consisted of the administration of a questionnaire to 551 junior high school art students. The answers were tabulated and an analysis was made of the interrelations between the responses. Results indicated that the character and expressive  qualities of early adolescent art cannot be easily categorized; that students reject the art teacher as an evaluator of their work or as a source of ideas, and consider him as only a provider of materials; that students prefer working in small groups; and that a discrepancy exists between the aesthetic tastes of teachers and students. Such results imply a fairly clear mandate for the reorganization of junior high school art activities. (The appendix includes a copy of the student questionnaire.) (Author/JS)",

        "description":"The child who is unable to reproduce a melody at a given pitch range can begin to \"carry a tune\" by learning to hear and control his singing voice and to match his voice with voices of other singers or with instruments. The \"too low problem singer,\" the child with the most common difficulty, must learn to make successful song responses in his normal speaking voice and then to find his true singing voice. Consistent control of his singing voice depends on the development of singing skills--habits of manipulating tonal images and habits of employing the motor skills required in correlating the singing voice with tonal images. Most important to the solution of all singing problems is a positive attitude on the part of both teacher and pupil. (This manual, a product of the research  reported in TE 499 967, contains examples of specific corrective techniques and materials.) (JS)",

He might come to realize that his chief duty is not to transmit and discuss what has already been known but to train a student to think with increasing independence of a teacher. Other questions which he would have to consider are (1) whether students are actually treated as individuals in any concrete and productive sense, (2) the usefulness of the question-and-answer pattern in examinations and discussions, (3) the value of small classes and a low student-faculty ratio, (4)  the value of covering large amounts of material, and (5) the wisdom of thinking in all-or-nothing terms when developing new approaches to teaching.

Described in particular are the negative implications of segregation and racial prejudices, both for those who discriminate and those who are discriminated against. It is noted that intergroup prejudice may stem from an individual's personal anxieties or childhood conditioning. The stereotyped idea of Negro inferiority, fears of intermarriage, and interracial sexual fears are specifically discussed, and a distinction is drawn between racial problems and the disguising of nonracial problems, such as socioeconomic and educational deprivation, by attributing them to race. To change these attitudes of prejudice within a  community, educators, parents, community leaders and mental health personnel must evince firm leadership and a well-defined policy. (LB)",

It is essential that educators be concerned with the total development of an adaptive system in the community, cooperating with other group leaders outside of education, and not feasible educational changes within an existing system. In the past educators have primarily used persuasive techniques to promote educational change, which though often not effective can become useful parts of planned strategies. After the goals of change are clearly defined, priorities can be assigned to political strategies. The superintendent of schools holds a powerful public position which he can use to influence change. The time taken by the superintendent to talk  to influentials in the community could be a critical factor in the acceptance of school projects in the district. Impact, especially in open power systems, can be produced by a cohesive group of teachers combined with effective political leadership. (JL)",

Independent three-item measures of militant group pride and general group disparagement provide a means of classifying respondents as positive, negative, or ambivalent in their orientation toward the in-group. Group identification is related to a variety of measures of orientation toward non-Negroes (e.g., anti-white prejudice) and the general society (e.g., community identification), and the data consistently reveal a significant  positive relation between ethnic group identification and orientation toward the broader society.

Because it is felt that the degree to which district superintendents are consulting with local school boards is inadequate to achieve administrative decentralization, the Committee recommends that the central Board of Education (1) plan elections to permit communities to elect their own local school governing boards, (2) institute learning programs for governing boards and district superintendents, (3) make the governing boards responsible for visiting schools, and (4)  delegate to the boards the right to hire and fire district superintendents, consult with district superintendents on every tenure appointment, and approve budgets and curriculum. The Committee also presents guidelines for decentralization (number of districts, role of the community, etc.) and suggests a transitional plan. (EF)",

A comparative group of 1,143 similar line poverty youngsters in the same schools, but not in the Neighborhood Youth Corps, were also analyzed in areas where parallelisms occurred. Two-thirds of the enrollees listed retention in school until graduation as the main purpose of the Neighborhood Youth Corps. Most spent their wages on items of school needs and social respect. A fundamental factor in the development of good work attitudes and self-esteem was the enrollee's feeling of job satisfaction. This depended on wage satisfaction, satisfaction with the &quot;boss,&quot; and satisfaction with the work itself.  Attitudes were positive on the last two; the first evoked large scale criticism. White collar jobs were most popular with no discrimination among Negroes and whites in these placements. The fact that one-third of the enrollees were working in unskilled categories represents a problem for the Neighborhood Youth Corps. In general, Neighborhood Youth Corps participants received little more counseling than the comparative group. Project directors recognize the need for greater effort in this area.

Focus was placed on how these elements influenced their adjustment to self and school. Although 84% of both groups indicated graduation as their goal, the Neighborhood Youth Corps enrollees showed better attendance and greater responsiveness to counseling. However, there was little disparity in their study habits and subject interest. Also, in the area of general orientation towards school, there was no strong statistical difference between Neighborhood Youth Corps members and their fellow students. Similarly, the occupational goals of  both groups were virtually identical. Despite careful reservations, however, the overall conclusion of the authors was that the Neighborhood Youth Corps appears to be improving the lot and attitudes of our nation's improverished youth as they go through high school. This is because of the in-built features of the program: work experience, direct contact with supervisors, increased self-respect, and alleviation of poverty.

It was based on responses from 1257 project officials representing an enrollment of 102,468 youths. There were 490 urban projects, 703 rural projects, and 64 &quot;mixed projects.&quot; General project characteristics for the country as a whole, as well as for each region, were analyzed in terms of population type, program size, varieties of employment stations, and enrollees' descriptions. It was found that most differences among projects existed, not because of regional location, but rather due to size and type. In general, large urban programs assigned participants more effectively to &quot;white collar&quot; jobs, provided  more direct and frequent supervision between staff members and enrollees, and offered more counseling service. Also, the larger the project the more adequate was the funding for a variety of activities. However, 72% of all sponsors reported that there were more students eligible for the Neighborhood Youth Corps than their budgets allowed. The most important success factor in the program, according to 86% of the respondents, was the simple placement of a youth in a job for which he received wages. Job satisfaction and counseling also contributed to the enrollee's sense of achievement. (RB)",

He also feels that although it may delay integration, which has a positive effect on the child's school performance, decentralization will improve the ghetto schools, which in turn will help develop individual communities and permit them more power in the larger society. Other articles--&quot;Ghetto Schools Need Black Power&quot;  (Edward Gottlieb), &quot;The Brooklyn Dodgers&quot; (Jason Epstein), and &quot;The Mason-Dixon Line Moves to New York&quot; (I.F.

Some conclusions were: (1) The exodus from agriculture has recently accelerated, (2) The highest rate of decrease was in the United States, (3) The outflow of agricultural labor has contributed to the nonfarm labor supply, (4) There is a decreased percentage of young adults in agriculture, (5) The agricultural exodus can primarily be explained by unfavorable incomes, and (6) Agricultural exodus is a  normal part of economic change leading toward higher levels of living for all groups in a society. It was recommended that: (1) the trend towards fewer agricultural workers be recognized as a normal part of modern economic development, (2) mobility of manpower be recognized as beneficial to economic growth, (3) rural education be similar to that in the urban areas, and (4) economic activity be encouraged in areas threatened with de-population.

The objective of the study was to estimate the functional relationship between 2 years of technical schooling and the incomes of the graduates. Initial interviews were held in the summer and fall of 1963 and a second interview was held in September 1964 to update the data. Regression analysis was used to control the sources of variance related to home and community environment, academic performance in high school, civilian and military experience, and investments in migration. Findings included: (1) The average total cost per technical graduate was  $7,425, foregone income accounted for 70 percent of this amount, (2) Approximately one-third of this cost was paid from public funds, (3) Average adjusted first year earnings were $555 higher for the technical graduates, (4) Average monetary returns increased $161 per year for the first 4 years after technical schooling. (5) An estimated value of technical graduates' additional leisure time was $446 annually, and (6) Constant annual return projections to age 65 indicated a 16.7 percent rate of return for technical graduates, while similar projections based on differential annual returns indicated a 20.1 percent rate of return.

Two groups of 10 aides each were equated for age, sex, formal education, previous inservice training, and performance on a civil service test. The investigator used the case method with one group and lecture-discussion with the other in teaching interpersonal relations in caring for the patient at admission and orientation and in caring for the overactive, underactive, withdrawn, antisocial, adolescent, aged, and convalescent patient. A multiple-choice pretest, a clinical performance evaluation checklist and an opinionnaire were tools for  evaluation. It was concluded that the case method was slightly more effective. Some recommendations were validation of results through similar studies, and study of the application of principles learned through the case method over a period of time.

Questionnaires and permanent college records were obtained for 1,022 recipients of B.S. degrees in Agricultural Education from 1940 to 1964. Their home background, high school and college record, first employment, and employment in 1964, were among the data collected. Throughout the 25-year period, 32.6 percent of the graduates who had entered teaching were  teaching vocational agriculture in 1964. Graduates who had entered vocational agriculture teaching but left for other occupations ranked the following items as having had the greatest influence on their decision: (1) (1) long hours and evening responsibilities, (2) salary and advancement opportunities, (3) community factors, and (4) failure to adjust to the teaching assignments.

Among the developments discussed were: (1) Work life expectancy declined by one-half year between 1950 and 1960, reversing a long-term rise between 1900 and 1950, (2) The decline in work life expectancy resulted from a small increase in life expectancy combined with accelerated trends towards longer schooling and earlier retirement, (3) One of the circumstances most directly associated with the decline in the age of retirement has been the continued liberalization of social security benefits and coverage, (4) Under 1960 conditions a  male worker at age 20 could expect to live almost 50 years and to work almost 43 years, (5) If it is assumed that the 1961 age patterns of job changing remain constant during the next 40 or so years, it can be estimated from the 1960 table of working life that a 20-year-old man will make more than six job changes (defined as a change of employer) during his remaining work life.

A partially matched control group of 925 persons who were unemployed at the time trainees entered training was also interviewed, as well as 136 persons who had been referred to the courses but who failed to enroll and participate. The effects of training were ascertained through comparison of the sample groups, using multiple regression analysis to control for the effects of 10 factors other than  training. A large number of tentative findings were reached, the most general and conclusive of which were: (1) Most trainees gave favorable evaluations of their training, (2) Training apparently did not help get better paying jobs, but it did help former trainees to obtain more full-time employment, and (3) It was estimated that between 13 and 23 percent of the full-time employment experienced during the period after training was attributable to Manpower Development and Training Act for completers, and between 7 and 19 percent for dropouts.

        "description":"The paid annual vacation is now the rule rather than the exception in conditions of employment in the United States. Collective bargaining and unilateral decisions by employers have increased the length of paid annual vacations and reduced qualifying periods of employment for millions of workers. In recent years the 4-week annual vacation has become the ultimate reward of long-service employees and the 3-week vacation has replaced the 2-week vacation. However, there is much reluctance to extend these rewards to other than long-service employees. Statistical data on which to base firm vacation-cost estimates are not available presently. The employer's desire to keep down costs is the most plausible explanation for not expanding vacation benefits to more workers. But universal  3-week annual vacations for full time employees would approximate the increased cost, per employee hour worked, which is regularly negotiated or granted unilaterally with unions. Vacation developments in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Western Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are summarized.

It was believed appropriate to examine, after nearly 3 years and a commitment of 4 billion dollars, the extent to which the Act had been implemented. Job creation and training were to be the principle means through which the three programs would help economically disadvantaged youth and adults achieve economic independence. A variety of published and unpublished materials were used in this assessment. In the process of critical evaluation, separate discussions are devoted to the enabling  legislation, administration, needs and characteristics of clients, and resource utilization of each program. It was generally concluded that it is doubtful whether the programs have achieved the formal goals of the legislation--economic self-support.

It is a formal adjunct, as are the schools themselves, to those social mechanisms which differentiate persons within the community and prescribe the type of status which they are expected to assume; (2) Contemporary Vocational Education in the United States. The vocational education program should be designed to prepare youth for a continuing program of  adult education throughout life; (3) A Conceptual Approach to the Sociological Analysis of Vocational Education.

Part of a continuing research program on local government finances, the report was designed to fill some important gaps and provide the basis for future research efforts in this area. Development of a consistent data system required selection of a manageable number of the most relevant areas from among the current total of 231 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and adaptation of an extensive system of basic data for each of these by means of classification and coverage which permit  internal comparison and, at the same time, provide historic continuity. The data include information, sometimes as current as 1967, covering the general topics: (1) location and types of major metropolitan areas, (2) population, (3) land, (4) population densities and housing, (5) employment size, composition, and trends, and (6) income and wages.

        "description":"In presenting a complete program of occupational education for the Denver metropolitan area, this proposal offers 12 criteria for consideration in conjunction with a particular occupational need. The purpose of the criteria is to provide guidelines for determining in which level of school a program should be offered. The criteria include factors such as age of the students, length of time required, faculty availability, facilities needed and available, what related programs are available, accessibility, size of school, nature of related training needed, and field experience. Illustrations of clusters or families of occupations covering the spectrum of preparation from high school through 4 years of college are provided. The recommendations include the need for vertical  articulation--that is, the planning of a sequence of programs from high school through junior college and 4-year programs. (CH)",

It is the result of a 4-day workshop of leaders in local government and school systems, held in late 1967 at the University of Maryland, and involving 42 persons from 15 cities that had submitted Model Cities planning grant applications. Fifteen papers (included in this report) were delivered by some of the 28 expert practitioners, academicians, and federal administrators in the fields of education and manpower who served as the workshop faculty. The workshop focused on new strategies and programs, innovative approaches to a cooperative action by all agencies, and  comprehensive manpower and education development operations, but no single strategy for success was uncovered. Experimentation, collaboration, and compromise were recognized as essential and certain guidelines for cities were developed, including: (1) Citizen participation in the planning and implementation of programs should be encouraged, (2) Cooperation and coordination between city hall, the schools, and others must be achieved, and (3) the Model Cities approach embodies the necessary elements and is the best current example of the paths to be followed to solve the urban dilemma.

Answers to two questions were sought: \"What is an educational development project?\" and \"How should one go about planning or conducting educational development projects?\" These papers were presented. \"The Economic Evaluation of Development Projects in Education\" by Ernst W. Stromsdorfer discusses basic principles of design which allow economic evaluation of development projects. \"Some Decision Points and Alternatives in Developmental Curricula\" by Hulda Grobman suggests 18 considerations on this topic. \"A Perspective of Developmental Projects\" by John D. McNeil reviews guidelines for the organization and operation of  developmental projects. \"The Relationship of R&D to Educational Improvement: An Output-Oriented Model\" by Hendrik D. Gideonse contrasts research and development projects to educational development projects and presents a graphic model of the differences. A model of the developmental project process is included.

The study focused on 108 contiguous, rural-oriented, low-income counties in the states of Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, an area with income growth lagging behind that of the nation. Data for the analysis were taken from censuses and other published data. The authors felt the study's contributions to the general body of labor force participation analyses were to be found in its geographic setting and in its methodology focusing on the family as a decision-making unit regarding labor force participation. A crude model was developed in  which the key factors affecting labor force participation were classified as need variables, opportunity variables, and family structure variables. The data were then analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression program which revealed that two variables, precent of personal income from nonwork sources and percent nonwhite account for about 50 percent of the variation in standardized male participation rates. Other findings and specific directions for further research are also discussed. (ET)",

An introductory  section discusses the role of manpower forecasting and its historical development. The concluding section reviews the forecasting techniques in terms of the following dichotomies: (1) short-term versus long-term forecasting, (2) stochastic versus the deterministic approach, (3) point versus interval forecasts, (4) unconditional versus conditional forecasts, and (5) first-order versus higher-order forecasts.

The United States is entering its eighth year of economic expansion, due in part to the &quot;stimulus&quot; economic policies of the federal government. Employment levels, while not full, are aimed at 3.75 percent unemployment for 1968, so that we can conserve the possibilities for greater employment later and not jeopardize the opportunity for maintaining expansion. Accelerating inflation is not acceptable and policy makers will feel pressure to hold the economy down and to adopt the main objective of stopping inflation. Consumer's savings have kept our economy from going through the roof and the President has appealed for voluntary restraint with a three-pronged program  including stabilizing the growth of demand, voluntary cooperation, and an attack on structural impediments to efficiency and cost reduction. The latter includes the establishment of a Cabinet Committee on Price Stability which will deal with inflationary bias built into our economy. If wage-price spiral disturbances can be lessened and continued manpower training can help smooth the path our program should work. The text of a question-answer session is included. (EM)",

On the first day of the institute, participants compiled a questionnaire regarding their needs and objectives. Some indicated they would have administrative responsibilities, others primarily teaching responsibilities, and others a combination of both. The objectives stated were in keeping with the objectives previously  developed for the institute. Teaching methods included practice teaching of institute members, lecture, discussion, and small group activity. Written evaluations at the end of the third and fourth weeks and four months after the institute indicated general satisfaction with the outcomes. Both administrators and classroom teachers indicated utilization of learnings in the post institute evaluation.

Phase II involved 3 weeks in which academic teachers, occupational teachers, and occupational counselors modified or developed new courses in mathematics, English, Social Studies, and Science. This was done so the academic courses could support and reinforce occupational subject matter. A job analysis-subject matter area matrix was developed which allowed decisions concerning which courses should include particular competencies. Following this, subject area  curriculum guides and suggested classroom activities were developed.

The time has come, however, for a change in the continuing pattern of employers engaging in experimental and demonstration projects, each learning anew what others have learned about hiring, training, promoting, and providing compensatory and remedial services for the hard-core unemployed. Assistance and guidance must be provided to employers by government agencies whose staffs have acquired knowledge and competence in this field. Government agencies must begin to view themselves as major employers and to &quot;practice what they preach&quot; to nongovernment employers in terms of seeking out and providing meaningful job  opportunities to the unemployed. A recent ruling by the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Labor allows Manpower Development and Training Act and other federal manpower monies to be used for reimbursing government agencies for hiring and training disadvantaged individuals. Beyond these remedial efforts of government and industry, there must be a massive joint undertaking to eliminate those conditions in the country's elementary, secondary, vocational, and higher education schools which permit an individual to be disadvantaged when he enters the labor market.

Among the questions asked by the investigating committee were: (1) costs involved in such a system for educational purposes? (2) What is the number and locations of the facilities in operation and those planning operation? (3) What are the attitudes of students and faculty towards acceptance and use of the system? Three-hundred questionnaires were sent to institutions and 10 schools and colleges were chosen for onsite interviews. It was concluded by the committee that at the present time maximum advantage cannot be taken of the dial access technology or the instructional materials and  programs available to it. The rapid developments in electronic technology for the retrieval and transfer of stored audio, visual, and printed information and the possible instructional patterns for utilizing this technology, do not present the kind of stability that an institution can confidently expect for finding and adopting tried and true instrumentation and technology.

Current provisions (1966-67) for the training of correctional, probation, and parole personnel were highly inadequate. Accordingly, a systematic plan of education has been proposed for meeting the technical on-the-job training needs of such personnel, and providing them with skills and conceptual knowledge, through training institutes and formal higher education. It is also proposed that the extensive university,  governmental, and other training resources of the state be mobilized for the benefit of these persons. Phases of program implementation and coordination are expected to include content and instructional methods development, direct training, employee self-improvement, improved salaries and advancement opportunities, an intern program, research and evaluation, joint planning, and several categories of training project personnel.

Long term residential colleges such as Ruskin, Hillcroft, the Cooperative College, Fircroft, Coleg Harlech, and Newbattle Abbey are expanding as centers in which students can be prepared for the university or other forms of  higher education. Teachers colleges are being encouraged to provide more flexible admission procedures and to accept more mature students. Day colleges in metropolitan areas provide convenient teacher training facilities and grants which are sufficient for married women.

Because of the nature of the source models, three categories (events, process, and decision) were used. Interviews were either narrations of specific instances of the processes under study or less formal interviews in which respondents described policies and general procedures. Data suggested the existence of information efforts activated by both supply and demand; the existence of separate processes was neither  proved nor disproved. Supply-activated aspects of research utilization seemed to need better analysis. All narrations are now being flow-charted for study of relationships within the process. Collection of comparable data in other countries is also planned. (Included are appendixes on process and event items, sample item cards, and sample protocols.) (ly)",

Respondents were asked to recall instances of effective and ineffective behavior on their part, to emphasize behavior critical to achieving an effective outcome, and to indicate why they considered a given incident effective or ineffective. Finally, a structure of relevant concepts was identified and linked to behavioral categories. Key behavior was grouped within seven major categories; preconditioned or set behavior; programing; mobilizing resources  and facilitating action; coordinating action to administer agency programs and activities; providing voluntary leadership; influencing clientele evaluation and adoption of innovations; and regulating programs and activities. Concepts were identified and interpreted under the headings of the system and its growth and development, planning change and development, managing change and development, and influencing the evaluation and adoption of innovations.

Data on interaction, sociability, and demographic factors were obtained with the Reciprocal Category System, a scale of social introversion and extraversion, and a brief questionnaire. All types of interaction but one correlated significantly with interaction rate. None of the demographic variables (age, sex, race, administrative experience,  teaching experience, educational background) correlated significantly with interaction. Implications for research were noted. (Included are ten references and four illustrations.) (ly)",

Relationships between APL and agent morale and performance, CEC attributes, and CEC relationships with agents, were assessed. Results were reexamined after adjusting for effects of sex, level of education, tenure, and career satisfaction in reports by observer agents. Major findings were: (1) CEC conformity to an APL role concept appeared significantly related to agent morale and performance; (2) chairmen who considered the APL concept very important had higher APL scores; (3) personal characteristics of agents had essentially no effect on coefficients for measures (managerial support, equality, support in conflict situations) of  CEC-agent relationships. Findings suggest that, where they provide agents with managerial support, minimize status distinctions, and support agents in conflict situations, CEC are more likely to negotiate certain obstacles (agent resistance and limited time) and conform more closely to the APL role concept.

The educational experiences were divided into 4 groups -- low, medium, high, and very high -- depending on the level of the learners' participation and the extent to which the learning was focused on their interests and experiences. These factors were rated on a subjective basis by the author. From a variety of approaches to predicting successful group leaders, a series of short questions that actually discriminated successful from unsuccessful group leaders were selected. Three attitude questionnaires were put together in a leadership inventory and studies of its reliability ranged from .70 to .90 (odd-even and test-retest). Studies of its  validity in eight field situations ranged from .23 to .69 with an average of about .50. These are multiple correlations and were established using the Aitken method with rank order correlations and the Jenkins method with product-moment correlations. The findings revealed that high participation led to a more significant attitude change than low participation. (nl)",

Both programs used a multimedia basic education system developed by a commercial firm.

Fifteen men and 15 women were interviewed with an open ended questionnaire listing 50 possible reasons for selecting a helper and 35 possible ways in which a helper assisted with the problems. Among problem areas were careers, marital difficulties, alcoholism, bereavement, moving, family conflicts, and feelings of inadequacy. Problems had persisted for periods of time varying from six months to more than three years. Respondents selected helpers who were older, married, friends or relatives, same nationality or sex, and of similar educational level and religion. Men tended to choose helpers who were perceived as warm, friendly,  and sincerely interested in them, while women selected helpers who took them seriously, listened, and kept confidences. Natural helpers appeared to share similarities to professionally trained persons described in counseling literature. Objective findings suggest that natural helpers may be identified through the testimony of those whom they have assisted, and subjective findings suggest that natural helpers may be identified by self disclosures in an interview.

The first type, the &quot;new developing nations,&quot; (sub-Saharan and East Africa) have little to draw upon in terms of a useable socio-cultural or political past. The language problems reflect emphasis on political integration, for which purposes Western languages are adopted. Successful language policy in these new nations leads to bilingualism and monolingualism. The second type, the &quot;old developing nations,&quot; (North Africa, the Near East, and South-East Asia) have the problem of creating the new out of the old and the hallowed. Their classical standard languages usually differ substantially from the current vernaculars of the masses. The tendency is to import a Western language in  toto for modernization. A suggested compromise is to use Western loan words or translation loans for lexical expansion. (This is resisted by classicists.) The &quot;intermediate&quot; or third type, (India and Pakistan) have strong links with great traditions and have all of the difficulties of the first two types. Like the &quot;new&quot; nations, they may require the more permanent utilization of a Western language for the purposes of political and economic modernization and national integration. Like the &quot;old&quot; nations, they may require the development and modernization of one or more indigenous traditional languages for local and regional socio-cultural modernization and integration.

At the same time, however, both linguistics and psychology can be extremely useful to the language teacher, not because they furnish principles which can be extrapolated into the language-teaching situation, but because they are tools necessary for a meaningful analysis of the teaching process and of teaching experience. Elaborated upon is a simple example of the use of linguistic and psychological principles as tools of the analysis of the teaching process. A master teacher's performance in teaching contrast in English mass nouns vs. count nouns,  and \"want\" vs. \"hope\" is observed and analyzed according to--(1) frame of reference, (2) reward of correct response, (3) use of a variety of stimuli, (4) gradual withdrawal of control stimuli, and (5) use of concept learning (grammatical explanation). Such analyses may provide a model that can be defined, studied, and replicated in other teaching situations. What is more important, the author feels, is that once the elements of the psycholinguistic model have been identified, the model itself can be made the subject of research; the teacher variable can be eliminated through using the model in programed instruction.

        "description":"The author examines some statistics which indicate entire classrooms of Indian students at the junior high school level are reading at the second or third grade level, and are graduated from high school with perhaps intermediate grade reading ability. Various surveys seem to have established that children are able to achieve at grade level through the primary grades but their level of achievement from that point on is an endless downward spiral. In the intermediate grades, the carefully controlled content and vocabulary breaks down; the children are expected to learn, at a faster rate, more complex materials in various content areas. At this point also, instruction in reading usually stops. That the principles of teaching English as a second language should be observed is  obvious, and lack of facility with English handicaps the child in learning to read English. However, it cannot be said that the ability to speak English will insure ability to read English. Teaching oral English and teaching reading are not identical processes and do not have the same purposes. Further, the processes and aims of initial reading instruction and advanced reading instruction are not the same. At higher levels, the students should equate words not with sounds but with meanings. They should explore, interpret, and extend the concepts represented in writing in order to develop the conceptual basis for abstraction in English. (AMM)",

Markle's &quot;Words: A  Programmed Course in Vocabulary Development,&quot; Science Research Associates, 1963, is part of the present curriculum. The ELI 72 course, meeting three times a week, uses Harris'&quot;Reading Improvement Exercises for Students of English as a Second Language,&quot; Prentice-Hall, 1966. The reading courses are summarized as stressing (1) elimination of poor reading habits, (2) training in reading by structures, (3) timed reading exercises, (4) practice in reading different kinds of material in class, (5) lectures on important cultural concepts, (6) practice in taking tests under timed conditions, and (7) vocabulary development using programed texts.

        "description":"The initial stage of second language learning usually aims to develop the ability to converse. This conversational ability is, however, rarely the ultimate object of second language instruction. The student may want access to the literature of the culture of the second language, or to get an education in it. For these reasons, interest shifts toward reading and writing, two skills which tend to dominate the intermediate and advanced levels of second language instruction; and the student advances toward the time when he will be treated as a native speaker of the second language. The unstructured conversation of six-year-old native speakers does not differ substantially in syntactic complexity from that of adults. The child, however, has much to learn in the areas of organization  and style. The task of a pre-literature text for a native speaker is to (1) teach the organizational patterns which enable an adult to raise conversation to the level of systematic instruction, narration, or coherent exposition; (2) consider the extent to which alternate ways of saying something are equivalent; and (3) prepare the child to recognize the conventional patterns of style. It is suggested that intermediate level language materials be differentiated from elementary level materials in both methodology and content. Emphasis should be less on pattern practice of single sentences and more on close reading and controlled writing of longer units of sentences. (AMM)",

The phases of language theory and methods covered in the training included developing an understanding of the intimate relationship between a culture and its language; a limited contrastive analysis of the sound, structure, and vocabulary systems of English and Spanish; oral drill techniques with practice and suggestions for classroom use; suggestions for adapting texts provided by the State, with emphasis on sound and structure drills from the text selections; and sequencing of the introduction of new structural elements. The author considers the most obvious affirmative  result to be the disappearance of many of the attitudes of complacency and defeatism on the part of the teachers, and stresses the fact that second-language teaching has been carried on effectively overseas for many years.

Their pupils represented 16 Indian tribes, ranging from Navaho, where many children come to school knowing no English, to Salish and Kutenai, where most beginning school children speak English. Estimated enrollment of these schools ranged from 25 percent to 100 percent Indian. In addition to estimating the attendance, the participants were asked to categorize their students according to whether they spoke (1) standard English, (2) nonstandard English, (3) little or no English, or (4) standard English, but with limited vocabulary due to socioeconomic  conditions. Categorization was difficult for some teachers because of their standards of oral speech and &quot;degree of teacher permissiveness,&quot; as well as the fact that many teachers were quite unaware of the speech of their students. Figures arrived at from the teachers' evaluations tend to suggest &quot;the lamentable conclusion that many children who attend our schools to learn English only succeed in learning a nonstandard variety, or in preserving it if they arrive speaking nonstandard English.&quot; (AMM)",

The author feels that if a grammar is stated completely explicitly it can be represented in the form of a relational network of the type proposed by Lamb. He discusses some formal properties of such networks and makes some revisions to Lamb's formulation which allow the formal properties and the structural complexity count to be kept as simple as possible. The notion of &quot;hill climbing&quot; on equivalence spaces defined by the formal properties and the complexity count is introduced as a model of the simplification part of language acquisition. The author suggests that using the complexity count he proposes, the process of simplification in disjunctive form is &quot;non-uphill all the way.&quot; Thus he finds  that the network approach not only gives a simpler overall system, but one which has the added advantage of starting linguists along the path of developing a detailed model of the process of language acquisition.

More than one language is needed as the medium of instruction where the child's mother tongue may not be English. Instruction in a weaker language not only retards reading, but arithmetic and other subjects are not as well learned if the child must cope with unfamiliar subject matter in an unfamiliar tongue. In the past, many tests of language proficiency have not been properly designed, resulting in misleading scores. A committee of educators and administrators has suggested that bilingual schooling can result &quot;in superior educational achievement.&quot; Experimental projects, using the mother tongue as the medium for instruction at early stages, support this proposition. In addition, bilingual  programs tend to improve community involvement in the education process.

These materials must include forms the child uses and hears, and exclude forms he does not hear and use. They must avoid complex constructions and ambiguity and make use of natural redundancy. Further, they must use language appropriate to the context in the experience of the child. Examples of the kinds of materials that can be developed are included in two of  the articles.

Formal correspondence may have a very low translation probability and therefore be of little value in a contrastive analysis. The author feels that the basis for contrastive analysis should be translation rather than formal correspondence. The translation approach has the added advantage of producing a series of low translation probability equivalents as well as one or more high translation probability equivalents. Together they cover the entire  semantic field. As with formal correspondence, translation equivalence will not be of great help to contrastive analysis where the equivalence is practically nonexistent. But one of the advantages of the translation method is that absence of translation equivalence is much less frequent than absence of formal correspondence. (Author/DO)",

Specific program areas are discussed as follows: (1) program-centered administrative consultation, where consultants served as resource people in minor policy making areas; (2) consultee-centered administrative consultation, where consultants helped staff to work as a team; (3)  consultee and client-centered consultation, which helped staff members develop adaptive ways of working with children and parents; (4) direct service to children, with formal and informal evaluation and procedures designed to aid staff to provide a therapeutic classroom environment; (5) the impact of children's aides, 23 of whom worked with the most severely disturbed children; and (6) short-term counseling for parents, individually or in groups. The author concludes that the Caplanian model is ideally suited to community action programs since it provides support for inexperienced staff. (NG)",

        "description":"This paper avaluates research on the characteristics and selection of counselors. It also considers the implications of recent developments in counseling theory and practice for the research on counselor characteristics and selection. There has been almost no research on counselor selection as such. The research on characteristics of counselors has been limited to counselors in training, with many studies simply describing the characteristics of groups of counseling students. Other studies comparing more effective with less effective student counselors have failed to define their criterion of effectiveness or failed to determine whether differences existed prior to training. A mediate criterion has been determined for counselor characteristics in the counseling relationship. This  criterion is applicable in a standardized manner to counseling interviews and demonstratedly related to counseling outcomes. This criterion, consisting of ratings of counselor empathy, congruence, warmth, and concreteness, makes predictive studies possible. It is desirable for predictive studies (1) to be evidently useful, (2) bear a concurrent relationship to the criterion, (3) apply to the applicants' interviews, and (4) be rather easily obtainable. Possible instruments are suggested. (KP)",

Studies find girls markedly superior to boys in language skills, with boys better in analytic thinking and transfer of learning. However, no sex differences in intellect have been found. There are differences in perceptions of self and the school experience, basically more negative for boys than for girls. Teachers respond differently to boys than to girls by differentiating instruction in segregated classes, and by giving higher grades to girls even on comparable achievement. The climate of the classroom effects the maturation of students. Counselors, therefore, can help teachers (1) use individual differences constructively,  both in tests and in the classroom experiences; (2) become better diagnosticians in collecting data on intellectual and nonintellectual factors and in keeping useful records; and (3) deal effectively with children experiencing classroom difficulties. To accomplish their goals, the counselor should be nonevaluative and experimental in attitude. (KP)",

The strength of the relationship between counselor-client diagnoses and perceived outcomes is demonstrated in both multiple counselor-client agreements and in counselor-client argument-disagreement.

This is a report of tentative findings at the Student Life Center, University of Colorado. There were three matched groups, each with nine sophomores. The first (on-going) group met one and one-half hours each week for eight weeks. The second group met 12 hours over a weekend (marathon group). The third group served as a control. The two co-leaders functioned in both encounter groups. Both groups went through similar dynamic phases, and were characterized by honest and satisfying patterns of relating, self-exploration, and self-disclosure. The marathon group was felt by members to be the more  rewarding experience. Data (reflected by a measure of increased feeling of internal control over the pattern of one's reinforcements) suggest that on-going group members became slightly more internalizing, while the marathon group became somewhat less internalizing. Future research, using the marathon in a variety of ways, will build in questions dealing with the individual within the dynamic interpersonal encounter. (KP)",

Data of 353 students were obtained before these students had any classroom training in research. Data on 263 students were obtained after the course was completed. The training plan exploited a number of naturally occurring differences among the five schools that influenced student learning. These included such factors as the relative emphasis on various aspects of content, differences in methods of teaching, and in learning experiences, variations in methods of evaluating learning achieved, the time and place of research in the curriculum, and teacher characteristics. Data on the objectives,  methods of teaching research, course content, and other details were obtained. Student characteristics and biographical data were also obtained. An instrument, the \"Measurement of Attitudes and Research Knowledge\" (MARK), assessed student attitude to, and knowledge of, research prior to the course and subsequent to its completion. Students also evaluated the teaching. The study found that various levels of potential for learning research can be identified, and learning achieved by students can be predicted. (Author/EK)",

The five psychological dimensions of value change which are important in dealing with children are explained.

Guidelines are given for handling controversial issues, and the responsibilities of the teacher are delineated. Effective teachers provide varied experiences and encourage students to develop their  own conclusions. Important emphases in the study of values are (1) building self-appreciation, (2) working with parents and community, (3) finding models, (4) using generalizations to stimulate discussion, (5) examining issues, (6) building on interests, (7) introducing children to life's paradoxes, and (8) determining personal goals and their symbolic representations.

Probabilities of satisfaction would be based on (1) the individual's vocational needs, and (2) information on the reinforcer characteristics of various occupational environments. These four lists of potential jobs would result: those in which the client would be (1) satisfied and satisfactory, (2)  satisfied and unsatisfactory, suggesting training, (3) unsatisfied but satisfactory, and (4) unsatisfied and unsatisfactory. The computer could also be used in individualizing assessment techniques which provide the banks of data on which the probabilities are constructed.

Highly significant differences in diastolic blood pressure may indicate differentiating patterns of autonomic responsitivity to stress. Families of the delinquents were perceived to be less cohesive, more hostile and rejecting, and overly strict, with some deviant or antisocial values. The delinquents' lower achievement motivation may suggest a familial transmission of attitudes toward school.

Relevant social  conditions are concern for the culturally disadvantaged, dropouts and unemployment problems, crime and delinquency, and the mental health movement.

A large body of research has documented the positive relationship between social class and educational attainment. However, research has shown that there is no relationship between graduation from the first college attended and social class. Data to test these arguments is based on interviews with 1,665 freshmen at a sample of 99 American colleges. In the first model, academic achievement is viewed as an important allocation device to occupational roles. Because of their higher occupational aspirations, we hypothesize that students from high socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds will be more adversely affected by low grades than low SES students. The data provide tentative support for this  argument. In the second model, \"ollege quality was seen as important for the allocation of students to occupational roles. Because ability and social class are positively related, students from high SES background are more likely to attend higher quality colleges. They in turn, have lower dropout rates than lower quality institutions, independent of students' individual social class. Data is presented that supports this argument. These arguments are integrated into a single set of propositions that link the effects of class based aspirations and those of differential institutional selection. (Author)",

To point out changes in conceptions, a comparison of collaborative and disengaging responses for each sex and age group was made.

Alan Anderson presents a group dynamics framework in which he discusses what is expected of group members, primary growth influences, composition and duration of groups, and primary group counselor concerns. Ann Abbey relates group counseling to gregariousness and communication needs in human nature, and proposes methods of implementing group work in existing educational situations. Stanley Caplan interprets group counselor style as the  impact of the counselor's behavior on group members. Benjamin Cohn discusses techniques and concerns of counseling with groups of children, primarily from grades four to 10, with the major stress on teaching honest feedback, sensitivity to others, and practicing these in everyday communication. Walter Lifton is concerned both with the question of honesty in eliciting conformity as a result of the counseling process and with openness of communication.

These hypotheses were largely supported. Absences from class had no adverse effects, and trends indicated favorable effects of independent study.

The most important of these, necessary and sufficient for nonverbal creativity, is seen to be a slight dominance of hippocampal or cortical inhibitory activity over reticular, or cortical arousal, activity. Considerable evidence, historical, biographical, and experimental, is brought to support this position. To the extent that the verbal centers in the dominant cerebral hemisphere are highly developed in early childhood, the corresponding interpretive centers in the nondominant hemisphere are undeveloped. These two physiological relationships have observable psychological counterparts in the taciturn, noncommunicative  person demonstrating nondistractable concentration and susceptibility to mental fatigue and temporary memory impairment, all characteristics of the nonverbally creative person as illustrated historically.

A strict absence policy prevailed. In dealing with student-faculty ratios, small discussion groups used student leadership and grading, better students served as teaching apprentices, paid student  assistants supervised labs, seminars, quizzes, and lecture sections.

Introductory remarks and welcoming presentations were given by Robert L. Frank, James Forsyth, and Leroy N. Jensen. The keynote address, \"Elementary School Guidance: An Emerging Dynamic,\" by Dale Nitzschke, discussed growth of the program, counselor preparation, and major issues confronting the field. A second major address, by John Krumboltz, presented elementary counseling as behavior modification in solving learning problems. Small group reports focused on group counseling, testing, play therapy, mental health in the classroom, and administrative procedures. A third major address, again by Dale Nitzschke, considered the role and situation  of the counselor in the elementary school at present and made predictions for the future. (BP)",

        "description":"Based upon selected findings of a case study of an elementary school which attempted to implement a major organizational innovation--the redefinition of the teacher's role in an individualized instructional program--factors were identified that help to explain why implementation efforts fail. The laboratory school, with a positive climate for educational change, contained nearly 200 pupils and 11 teachers in a depressed area with 60% Negro residents. In contrast to previous studies which have identified \"resistance to change\" as the main cause of an innovation's failure, analysis of the case study's findings determined that a number of important variables influence the implementation of directed change. These variables include (1) clarity of an innovation as perceived by  organizational members, (2) capability of members to perform it, (3) availability of necessary tools and equipment, and (4) compatibility of organizational conditions with the innovation. The administrator's role is particularly important in establishing conditions conducive to innovation and in rewarding innovative efforts. Resistance can develop over time as a consequence of frustrations members encounter in attempting to implement an innovation. From the study's findings a number of suggestions are drawn to assist in the implementation of organizational innovations. (JK)",

        "description":"Although complex organizations pursue more than one goal, one goal can be considered paramount. Adopted as a result of administrative disenchantment with the cultural rigidities of the 6-year high school organization, the middle school was established as a special unit for the education of early adolescents in a protective psychological environment which neither the elementary school nor the high school could provide. This differentiated function of the middle school was quickly endorsed by the education profession. The paramount goal of the middle school today is the psychosocial and cognitive development of the adolescent. The primacy of the psychosocial component is the most difficult challenge for middle school administration, requiring the principal to have a sharp  conceptual perspective of the middle school's unique function and to make sure that a functional balance of instrumental and expressive values is attained in the school environment.

Flexibility of programs and self-concept development of adolescents are key middle school responsibilities. In the socialization process for this age group not one educator, but a family of educators in the persons of doctors, social workers, psychologists, guidance counselors, and nurses are needed to perform auxiliary functions. Similarly, the use of &quot;core technology complemented with the humanization of education are important in the middle school's success. Of all public school units the middle school is best equipped to  accommodate built-in flexibility in curriculum design. General designs of school plants for future middle schools already exist; it is important that these designs be considered, for the middle school houses youth at the age where proper guidance could keep them from a life of delinquency.

First, current applications of data processing in education were reviewed to acquire detailed specifications for an educational data processing center's hardware, software, and liveware or personnel. Then, surveys, interviews, and other means were used to determine what the Center should do to establish such a facility. This part of the study had six dimensions: Assessment of need and identification of services, operational considerations, resource requirements, fiscal considerations, time considerations, and a pilot study of a computerized payroll problem. It was concluded that although sizable capital outlays  would be required to establish a data processing center, manual data processing activities carried out by local schools could be eliminated and more services could be provided. The following recommendations were made: (1) A highly competent and capable staff for the data processing division should be developed; (2) a hardware configuration should be based upon the types of services to be provided; (3) operations should be planned on a priority basis, with highest priority going to the least complex services; and (4) primary attention must be focused on completeness and accuracy of output before it is disseminated.

At present there is a great lack of such communication and cooperation, due to a variety of legal, constitutional, structural, financial, philosophical, historical, and psychological barriers, the majority of which are largely emotional in origin. There are two basic kinds of activities which can be used to overcome these barriers: (1) Research on the barriers themselves and development of proper solutions, such as shared time or dual enrollment; and (2) preservice and inservice training programs to improve mutual  understanding and increase contact between officials of public and nonpublic schools. School board members can play a vital role in overcoming the obstacles. Generally, they should be aware of what other related agencies are doing and provide the leadership in procuring available resources external to the public schools which may contribute to the achievement of the public schools' goals.

Strategies to ease the recruitment problems include: (1) Communicate to high school seniors information about the career, (2) encourage talented young people to enter  preparation programs from pools traditionally ignored by current recruitment efforts, (3) recruit persons from other careers in which relevant competencies are developed, and (4) recruit paraprofessionals to serve in supportive administrative roles in big-city school systems. To conduct the recruitment program, a consortium composed of the following kinds of agencies should be created: (1) A nationwide group of selected universities and associated school systems (it is recommended that UCEA serve this need), (2) a firm to produce printed and audiovisual materials, (3) a public relations or advertising firm, and (4) one or more funding establishments.

There is no clear set of rules constructed along do-it-yourself lines associated with the systems approach. There are, however, general procedures which are to be followed. The first step, defining the problem, includes four distinct phases: Defining the system's objectives, obtaining measures of effectiveness, identifying constraints and uncontrollable variables, and identifying controllable variables. After defining the problem, the next three basic steps are to define the subfunctions, to define the alternatives for each subfunction, and to synthesize the subsystems. Next a model should be developed. Although a model is an abstraction,  it is also a highly effective way of coping with reality, and its development calls for and guides data collection. The model must prove itself by predicting results reasonably well. However, in complex situations perfect prediction is rare and the whole system must continually be reexamined and changed as necessary. (HW)",

Approximately 500 students were enrolled in the experimental school, which practiced modular scheduling, and 1300 in the control school. In addition to general problems of the total program, questionnaire items covered practices and problems of large group sessions, small group sections, supervised study, and unscheduled time. Analysis of the study's findings indicated that the experimental school's use of the modular schedule in 1968 was more consistent with expected  practices than in 1965. The modular scheduling program was favorably received by both students and teachers.

Games focus on reality but are combinations of  skill, chance, reality, and fantasy. In designing games one must (1) define overall objectives and scope; (2) identify the key actors, their objectives, and constraints; (3) determine an interaction sequence and decision rules; (4) identify the win criteria; and (5) choose the form of presentation.

        "description":"Although games are not usually thought of as aids to planning, a special type of game can be helpful when problems are complex, factors determining resolution are imperfectly understood, and numerous views coexist. Objectives of the education system planning game are to illuminate major issues of educational planning, to increase the participants' awareness of the costs and benefits of alternative plans, and to stimulate an exchange of ideas concerning diverse approaches to education. The game is played by five teams. Two educator teams represent several levels of the educational establishment ranging from elementary school teachers to the U.S. Commissioner of Education. Their responsibility is to devise two separate plans within a fixed budget. A pair of student teams,  representing advantaged and disadvantaged student populations, must choose one of the plans and estimate its impact on their achievement as measured by increased number of graduates and quality. A \"reality daemons\" team personifies social problems related to educational planning. They eliminate all implausible gains estimated by student teams and deduct for counterproductive side effects. Winners are the educator team with the most productive plan, the student team making the greatest achievement, and the \"daemon\" with the most objections. (TT)",

The product of a university is defined as the intellectual growth of students and staff. Since this product can not be quantified, costs are assigned to class units (meetings of students and teacher) which are proxy variables representing the product. Information requirements for the construction of total cost schedules relating to the degree-granting process are formulated and examples are given. Methods for allocating and distributing direct and indirect expanses and revenues are analyzed within the cost model framework. By introducing the concept of marginal cost functions into the  framework it becomes possible to base predictions of fiscal requirements on each institution's unique policies and practices. Implications of this procedure are examined to show how the data can be transformed into useful studies of (1) factors influencing the cost of classes, (2) estimation of future expenses based upon changing student population, and (3) institutional or interinstitutional per student cost comparisons.

Through use of tape recordings, interviews, notes, minutes, and newspaper clippings, the chronology of events is reported, beginning with the passage of a law requiring consultation over economic matters and culminating in the adoption of the 1967-68 salary schedule. Concepts of industrial relations and bargaining theory as applied to private industry are used to analyze the reported negotiation process. It is concluded that (1) the traditional relationship between the board,  teachers, and superintendent was changing in the city studied, and (2) because it resulted in a harmonious settlement of differences, collective negotiation or consultation seems to be a viable process for use in the public sector.

The model is discussed in terms of (1) its context in the other budgets at Yale, (2) the rationale leading to its development, (3) its mechanism, and (4) the uses to which it has been put. The model is built around 12 simultaneous differential equations. The inputs include (1) initial values of state variables such as market values of the various fund classes, book values, and realized gains, (2) flow variables such as gifts  to endowment and the yearly operating budget, and (3) system parameters such as rate of return, yield rate, and trade rate.

Since much contemporary music literature exists for beginning piano students, it was assumed that the dearth of similar material for stringed instruments was caused by the nature of the instruments or by the way they are taught. To develop the project plan, standard string method books were analyzed to identify the skills that can be reasonably expected from young students and these skills were related to the performance of contemporary music. A Composers Guide (appendix A) was then designed to give composers interested in writing music for elementary  string students recommendations concerning beginners' technical skills and current pedagogical methods, while placing no restrictions on musical style. Six composers were commissioned to use the Composers Guide in writing 24 pieces introducing characteristic contemporary techniques (appendix E). The Composers Guide was found to be useful and was well received by the composers. Success of this approach with beginning students remains to be seen and depends upon gaining the support of music teachers. (TT)",

The major problems of metropolitanism as it affects public education are those associated with the ability of society to utilize not only its economic resources but also its social and cultural resources, which are even more significant in the education of children. Three areas of concern are the proper relations between educational government and other governmental units, the internal sharing of decision making, and the process of educational management. Exclusive exercise of local action with only local resources cannot deal successfully with the emerging problems which are  not local in nature. Potential solutions to the problems require that school districts cooperate and coordinate activities. An example of what has been done in this respect is an educational research and development council, a private nonprofit corporation consisting of 22 school systems established in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Minnesota.

Recently, major advances in the planning-budgeting process have become available to educators in the form of PPBS. Fiduciary budgets, which have been used in most schools since the early 1900's, have the following problems: (1) They are incremental budgets relying heavily on what was done the previous year, (2) they develop meaningless comparative data, (3) they do not reveal the source of funds, and (4) they are written only for the following year. Program budgeting, on the other hand, offers the administrator the opportunity to design a long term plan for creative instruction. PPBS delineates program integration  and highlights alternatives in a new way by aligning objectives and costs. PPBS differs from present budgeting procedures in that it (1) compels administrators to give some thought to alternatives, (2) stresses the significance of minor costs over a long period of time, (3) helps relate the cost of a program to its merits, and (4) links teacher aids, supporting activities, research, and development to subject matter in terms of time and cost.

Without exception, the consultants criticized the effectiveness of PACE evaluation. Their analysis and criticism produced eight general recommendations that are designed to vitalize and improve the  evaluation of PACE projects. These range from suggesting what proportion of project budgets should be devoted to evaluation to recommendations for establishing evaluation workshops. Finally, each of the consultants was asked to study 10 approved PACE proposals that focused upon his area of specialty, to judge the adequacy of evaluation procedures for these projects, and to prepare a report including any special recommendations for evaluation improvement.

Analysis and evaluation seek to determine whether (1) individual project objectives were identified and achieved, (2) PACE participation resulted in educational changes or improvements, (3) school districts were motivated to continue their programs through local funding and initiative, and (4) expenditures, efforts, and activity generated by PACE are justified in terms of outcomes. To accomplish these objectives, an evaluation instrument (appended) is used to investigate project characteristics, project accomplishments, provisions for continuation, project design,  and final appraisals. Major problems mentioned most often in conjunction with the projects include project finance, public relations, lack of clear planning and objectives, lack of qualified personnel, problems of implementation, and lack of official cooperation. The overall appraisal rated 76 projects as outstanding or good while only 61 were rated as average or below. Nine specific recommendations are made to aid the quality and continuation of future PACE projects. (TT)",

        "description":"This report consists of a survey and statistical analysis of Projects to Advance Creativity in Education (PACE) as viewed by the 920 project directors in this ESEA Title III program. Discussion centers about (1) characteristics of existing projects, (2) problems encountered, (3) views toward State, local, and Federal agencies, (4) criteria for evaluating and funding, and (5) ideas for the future development of PACE. The recurring most difficult problems of project operation were continuation after present funding is terminated, evaluation, delay in funding and approving modifications, and budget problems related to unseen needs. Most project directors felt that direct lines of communication and better knowledge of local problems were strengths of the State-local relationship,  while political problems and lack of leadership were the most likely flaws. Significant support was expressed for the Federal-local relationship. The most important factors in approving new projects were felt to be local needs along with innovativeness and creativity of the proposed project. Suggestions for the future most often involved increases in PACE funds, continuation of project funding after 3 years, more budget flexibility, and clearer guidelines and proposal forms. Five recommendations, based on analysis of the data, are designed to enhance future PACE effectiveness. (TT)",

        "description":"In this final report, 17 special consultants view from the perspective of their own specialities the future of the Projects to Advance Creativity in Education (PACE) program funded under ESEA Title III. The 17 individually authored reports approach the problem of whether or not this innovative and creative program has been afflicted with loss of imagination, and evaluate other problems related to the future of PACE. Points of focus include (1) curriculum and subject disciplines, (2) students, (3) school organization, (4) computer technology, (5) supplementary service centers, (6) school community relations, and (7) operation, priorities, and evaluation of PACE. The consultants unanimously conclude that turnover of ESEA Title III to the States and categorization of 15 percent of  PACE funds for the handicapped are examples of waning Federal freshness, dynamism, and dedication brought about by political manipulation and changes in USOE staff responsible for PACE. Politics, lack of imagination, and lack of organization are also plaguing the program at the State level, although its strength does continue at the local level. On the whole, the consultants find that PACE remains healthy, but with signs of premature old age. Recommendations to enrich PACE are made and recommendations of the first five reports are recapitulated. (TT)",

        "description":"Two introductory passages, one regular passage, and one experimental advance organizer passage developed to facilitate initial learning were assigned to normal and retarded children. The subjects were 184 normal 8-year-olds (controls' mean IQ 118.00, organizers' 118.80) and 184 educable mentally retarded 15-year-olds (EMR controls' mean IQ 74.85, organizers' 76.06). No student had a reading level below 3.5 and the means for all groups exceeded 4.0 grade equivalents. All then studied a learning passage and responded to an achievement test which was readministered 2 weeks later. Normal organizer exceeded normal control performances on both immediate and delayed retention measures (p.05) but no significant differences between EMR organizer and control groups were found on either  retention measure. It was speculated that the EMR-normal differences other than reading achievement and mental age were responsible for the differential utility of the advance organizer. Instructional practice in EMR classes, emphasizing concrete to abstract and specific to general subject matter sequencing, was suggested as antagonistic to advance organizer strategy and possibly responsible for the results.

        "description":"A discussion of research in the area of retardation influenced by recent developments in psycholinguistics, the problem of language assessment, and the problem of language training, first considers a review by D.R. Olson on language, the concept of transformational grammar, syntactic structure of sentences, the acquisition of linguistic meaning, and the interaction between innate biological factors and environmental influences. Studies on the language of the retarded are cited which indicate a connection between motor or chronological development and language development and which imply that language development in the retarded is slower rather than qualitatively different from that of normal children. Criticism is directed toward the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities  and the Peabody Language Development Kit on the grounds that neither is based on a viable model of linguistic competence and performance and that neither reflect recent work in the area of developmental psycholinguistics. Minimal requirements for a language assessment device are outlined in transformational terms as are hypotheses for research in language training. (RP)",

One frequency filter system presented frequencies from 425 to 1275 cycles per second (Hz) in one band and 2550 to 6800 Hz in the other; the second system presented frequencies from 637 to 1275 Hz and from 2550 to 5100 Hz. Subjects were asked to repeat 10 words from Thorndike's 1929 word list presented in each of four conditions: high frequencies only, low frequencies only, high and low frequencies to separate ears (integration), and both frequencies to both ears (normal). The integration and binaural  normal conditions were the only two conditions useful for assessing auditory integration. The second system produced higher mean errors under each condition, but no significant differences were found between the retarded and normal groups in mean number of errors. Only one retardate and possibly one normal boy were suspected of even minimal brain injury. Suggestions are made for future research. (RP)",

Comprehension ability was tested by asking each subject to indicate which of two pictures was being described in the sentence spoken by the examiner. Eight stimulus sentences were given for each pair of pictures, simple declarative or kernel, negative, passive, and negative passive. Kernel sentences were comprehended significantly more often than chance expectancy (p .08) but negative sentences less often than chance (p .02). Imitation of kernel sentences (obligatory transformations only) was significantly better than imitation of sentences in which optional transformations had been applied  (p .05). No significant differences in accuracy of imitation were observed among the strings with optional transformations. Competence and performance variables were considered to affect the ability of trainables to deal with verbal stimuli and further studies emphasizing the negative marker are recommended. (Author)",

Two instruments were constructed to evaluate language: a language test and a speech rating scale. Project leaders had no prior knowledge of the language test. The six children in group 1 received five 15- to 40-minute group conditioning sessions daily. Shaping was used to condition object and picture naming, descriptions of action pictures in work combinations, and discrimination of colors and polar opposites. Operant procedures were used to lengthen attention span and increase verbal production. The six children in group 2 spent 7 weeks in the enriched experimental  environment, but received no conditioning; the six in group 3 remained in the institution. Five of six members of group 1 significantly increased their scores on the Stanfore-Binet posttest; one from group 2 and none from group 3 increased significantly. On the speech rating scale, group 1 showed significantly greater improvement than group 2. Major changes were observed in the social behavior of the 12 subjects who resided in the research facility.

Forty nine classes of children (275 educable mentally retarded and 206 minimally brain injured) participated in 20 weeks of instructional programs. Classes were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: two were physical education programs (one individually oriented, the other group oriented); one was an art program (Hawthorne effect); the fourth, a control (usual program). A battery of 32 tests was administered prior to and at the end of the experiment. Children in the special experimental programs elicited greater positive changes in their motor,  intellectual, and emotional behavior than those in the control program. Of the special programs, the physical education programs were superior in modifying motor performance, the art program in altering emotional behavior, and neither was superior in modifying intellectual behavior. The individually oriented physical education program elicited greater gains than the group oriented program in measures of motor, intellectual, and emotional behavior. Positive behavior changes occurred more frequently in the older than younger, more often in the brain injured than the retarded, and more frequently in the boys than the girls. (Author)",

Each child was given a battery of thirteen subtests on an automated psychosensory system representing various combinations of auditory and visual intra- and intersensory conditions for verbal, nonverbal-nonsocial, and nonverbal-social stimuli. Comparisons were made between the normal children and the two types of learning disability groups (a school learning disability group and a clinic learning disability group). Two age groups of children were considered: 8-year-olds and 9-year-olds. The clinic learning disabilities appeared to have more acute disorders as a group than the school-derived population  of learning disabilities. They made significantly more errors on verbal psychosensory functions, regardless of the sensory conditions. In addition, the 9-year-old group displayed significant problems of an auditory intrasensory nature. There was a generalized failure of the clinic learning disabilities to perform the tasks with speed equivalent to their comparison groups. The use of response time criteria seemed encouraging as an area for future investigation but test batteries need revision as items may have been too easy. (Author/RP)",

Development planning is discussed in terms of time, location, and capacity. Physical requirements discussions concern land use, land value, population density, traffic, intra-campus characteristics, and campus circulation. Aesthetic standards and procedures for cost estimating are also outlined. Part II describes a master plan for consultant services and defines the purpose and function of the consultants. Consultants responsibilities in  long-range development planning include review, collection, and analysis of existing data about the master plan, city zoning ordinances, health regulations, map preparation, survey and analysis of physical conditions, land use, population distribution, topology, cost, landscape, utilities, and the preparation of drawings for presentation of the developmental plans to the community college system.

Demands for change have come from students, faculty, parents, and the community at large. As envisaged, the new program would be an inquiry or problem-solving approach to education using a series of three or four clusters of classrooms, seminar rooms, independent study areas, and faculty offices to house the program. Ten different alternative architectural solutions are offered ranging from minor alterations to the present building to the construction of an educational park. Plans and schematic diagrams are pictured for each of the schemes. Rough cost estimates are given  and space needs for each part of the educational programs charted. Also included are \"then and now\" photographs of the interior of the school building. Basic to all of the alternatives considered is the conversion, not the replacement, of the presently existing facility. (NI)",

The feasibility of using this model as an aid in design and production of instructional materials was investigated in three parallel studies. Each study involved a set of materials with either figural, symbolic, or semantic characteristics predominant in its subject matter. For each of the sets, still slide programs with audio tapes were prepared in three forms: figural, symbolic, and semantic. A total of 247 sixth-grade students were randomly assigned to one of the nine treatment groups, and measures of mental ability, verbal ability, and cognitive  abilities related to the three intellect factors were obtained for all participants. Performance was assessed by a written posttest. No conclusive interaction between modes of presentation, inherent content of materials, and learner characteristics was noted. Intelligence and achievement scores related positively to performance in all groups. (SS)",

The efficacy of programed instructional materials is frequently limited by their inability to command and maintain adequate attention and motivation. To consider social reinforcement effects available in group procedures, a slide version of a vocabulary program was presented to a study group, and individual students were randomly called upon to respond to different frames. Achievement posttests indicated comparable levels of retention in the study group and a control group which completed individual programs. An application of group methods to the teaching of music fundamentals also obtained comparable retention levels for  group and individual presentation methods. The feasibility of using a series of tests to delineate subgroups with homogeneous levels of preprogram knowledge and rates of learning was confirmed in a third study, while two final studies found partial prompting and underlining procedures resulted in no differences in retention when compared to conventional programed methods. Group use of instructional programs was considered well received and effective. (SS)",

A cumulative capital investment of $1,317,255 in television facilities provided 2,729 hours of instructional programing in 1966-67, broadcast to 137,516 pupils in 310 schools. Although the discontinuation of television would release $700,000 for other spending during the year, expensive revisions in personnel, curriculum, education, and financing would be necessary. Part-time operation of television might take the form of limitation to elementary, secondary, or community television, restriction of broadcasting to one channel,  the telecasting of only previously produced videotape programs, or a combination of these alternatives. Instructional television problems are born of the system-wide problem of inadequate classroom space for large-group instruction, which inhibits flexibility in program scheduling and the development of centralized and decentralized television operations.

To date, programed language instruction has relied on audio confirmation of oral response. A study was conducted to determine the value of adding visual confirmation to the audio model. A total of 170 experimental and 140 control students in second semester college French were tested for language aptitude. The control students used a programed course in the language laboratory which provided audio confirmation only. The experimental students used a form of the course which made the correct response to stimuli available in invisible ink. In this process, called ACCESS, the written response appears after the student gives his oral answer and marks in the proper space with an  impregnated pen. Students were tested for listening comprehension, writing, and reading, but only the writing test was used as a basis for comparison. The results obtained by the entire experimental class were significantly superior to those in the control group, while the dropout rate was less than half that for the control section. As predicted, low-aptitude students, those below the 40th percentile, particularly profited from simultaneously hearing and seeing the confirmation answer. (JY)",

        "description":"There is evidence that violence in motion pictures viewed by children on screen or television can contribute to violence in real life, although the movies can rarely be blamed as the sole cause of anti-social conduct. Clinical reports cite instances of the effect on \"susceptible\" youngsters; e.g., emotionally disturbed individuals. Long-term effects of the audiovisual media on the \"normal\" child are harder to substantiate. Laboratory experiments show that children learn a great deal from movies, and that there is a strong tendency for them to imitate violence even when they feel it is wrong. The doubtful \"catharsis hypothesis\" explores the idea that exposure to film violence might reduce the level of aggression in a viewer. The implication of accumulated studies is that the more  realistic the violence in a film, and the greater the degree of identification between the child and a violent character, the more likely the aggressive learning will be carried over into real-life behavior. This effect might be combated in a number of ways: reduce violence and the number of violent heroes in our movies, demonstrate by them that crime does not pay, and encourage the young viewer to apply \"adult discount\" to the fantastic situation.

This technology revolution is not a threat to teachers, but a source of educational tools to be used as a part of an overall teaching design. Most important to this design is an awareness of the right audiovisual aid for the right task. It is the teacher who must be able to combine conventional instructional methods with the new techniques of individual instruction and the new techniques of mass instruction. Instructional tools which have become more versatile as new uses for them have been suggested are the overhead projector and the opaque projector, as well as the non-projected  resources of the classroom environment. Language laboratories have proved their effectiveness, and some can be installed simply and inexpensively. As with other instructional tools, the key value of television is its effective use in conjunction with classroom instruction. Teaching machines and programed texts, aimed at the individual's learning rate, can be used in multiple ways. Analysis of school activities suggests many opportunities for improving instructional methods which cannot themselves be separated from subject content. (SE/MT)",

The goals of the New Left are first to disrupt and then to destroy our system of higher education and our representative form of government. These, however, are not the goals of the majority of students. Organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society simply escalate demands as concessions are made, but legitimate student grievances should be listened to and channeled to the administration. Increasing faculty power should be accompanied by an equal sense of responsibility. Academic freedom should not mean license  without limits, protected by an unchallenged system of tenure. The basic academic freedoms of expressing divergent views, protesting injustice, and promoting social change will be frustrated if current trends toward license, discord, even anarchy on campus and in the streets are not checked. The sooner New Leftists and their faculty allied are expelled, the sooner our campuses will resume their historic roles as centers of reason and intellectual pursuit. It must be evident that none of the grave problems of our time can be solved unless we first preserve an ordered society in which law is again respected and due process observed. (CS)",

Recommendations are made to revitalize, or to completely retain, some programs, policies or practices, depending on the extent of their contributions to the College's overall purpose. If they defeat general educational aims, it is proposed that they be discarded and efforts made to provide relevant, innovative educational experiences. Emphasis is placed on the development of a college self-identity, and the need to replace an outdated,  rigidly administered instructional program with a \"living\" curriculum, based on flexible principles, that would adapt to ever-changing institutional and social needs.

The 4-year Trent-Medsker study of some 10,000 high school graduates found that nearly 40% of the students able to enter college didn't and over 50% who did later withdraw and did not return during the study period. Of the students who started college, most entered local institutions, changed colleges at least once, and did not graduate within 4 years. Motivation to enter or persist seems to be most influenced by father's occupation, mother's education, general parental encouragement and cultural enrichment in the home. Dropouts and nonattenders saw the value of a college education in terms of vocational training and rejected  ideological exploration whereas graduates viewed their education as the gaining of knowledge and appreciation of ideas and were inclined toward abstract, reflective thought. Programs are needed to develop these intellectual goals where they are lacking. To break some cycles of indifference to education, universities need not expend vast resources for there are potential students in the backyard of almost every college. To motivate bright students to enter or persist in college, either the students must learn to value a traditional education or colleges will have to become more relevant for more students. The provision of local colleges tuned to the needs of the community and attempts to strengthen the WILL for college are both fruitful means for bringing about universal higher education.  (JS)",

Much fundamental learning occurs outside the classroom. As part of an overall longitudinal research project to determine the sources of impact on the lives of students as they develop or fail to develop in line with their initially assessed potentialities, a discussionaire was administered to freshmen in 5 diverse colleges in Spring 1967. Consisting of 120 possible topics for discussion, it asked students to state how often during the past year they had discussed the topic with persons their own age. Analysis of the top 10 topics for each campus shows that some topics are frequently discussed on all campuses, some are unique to particular campuses,  and others are related to the sex of the respondent. The Vietnam war was of major concern to students on all campuses, but the 1 topic that ranked among the top 10 on every campus for men and on 3 out of 5 for women was the \"state's governor and policies.\" On the Negro campus surveyed, there was considerable disparity between the conversations of men and women, though on other campuses, interests of women tended to parallel those of men.

Participants in the Free Speech Movement (FSM) at Berkeley were found to have similar characteristics, and Center researchers conducted a more detailed study on initiators of and participants in the movement. Three hypotheses were used to compare FSM students with non-participating or average students: (1) that FSM participants are better students, more autonomous, have broader intellectual dispositions and obtain higher GPAs, (2) that there is a larger percentage of transfer students in the FSM group, and (3) that the majority of transfer  students come from selective liberal arts, private, and public institutions. Three student samples were surveyed: 188 FSM participants who had been arrested, 60 FSM volunteers, and a randomly selected group of non-participating seniors. Findings of the study supported the 3 hypotheses. The arrested and volunteer students represent an unusual group that possesses exceptional scholarship potential, and their concern about social problems and political issues is secondary to their educational goals. They felt a need to become involved in academic matters and to attempt to establish a relationship between their education and problems in the world. (WM)",

Of 7 environmental characteristics at HMC student personalities and the socio-psychological culture (created by students, faculty and curricula), contribute most to academic surroundings. The majority of the engineering students were found to be self-reliant, free from dogmatic religious thought, and considered their vocational training as the prime reason for going to college. Their lack of commitment to social, political or scholarly causes, however, results in a stable though unexciting college environment. It is felt that  humanities and social science programs contribute to the development of certain student characteristics that broaden professional and social roles. Liberal studies should be included in engineering programs to motivate critical thinking and social commitment, and to expand the limited outlook currently held by engineering students. (WM)",

Generally more independent and mature, the students of the 1960's tend to involve themselves in any of 5 subcultures as a means of expressing their concern about a number of issues. The sorority or fraternity culture has lost its appeal except for a few that are shifting their interests from social to political issues. The vocationally-oriented group attends college as a step toward a career. The intellectuals, mainly humanities and social sciences majors, pursue knowledge as an end in itself. Some students in the Bohemian culture are intelligent non-conformists who adopt eccentric modes of dress and behavior, and others are political activists  who regard the university as a political platform. The hippie culture claims rejection of all cultures and societies and is the most dynamic of the youth groups. The basic problem for the university is the conception of a unified program that satisfies the academic and individual needs of each group. In order to communicate effectively, educators should attempt to acquaint themselves with and understand the characteristics and concerns of today's students, for they represent our future decision makers.

        "description":"The paucity of meaningful academic experiences for potentially or highly creative individuals prompted researchers and performing artists to meet and discuss the implications for creative opportunities in higher education. A truly creative person is thought to be independent, innovative, flexible, with a highly developed sense of the theoretical and the esthetic, and exercises discipline only when he considers it necessary. A rigidly structured and organized academic system invariably discourages self-expression. Consequently, a number of students transfer from or drop out of educational systems too formalized for their tastes. Unfortunately, academe generally assumes that educational needs of all unusual students are met in programs designed for the gifted or exceptional, and  many creative individuals who do not meet necessary academic requirements are excluded or ignored. Many questions were raised to which answers could not be provided but participants agreed that very little research has been done on creativity at the college level, except in the creative arts. The task ahead involves learning about the nature and forms of creativity, establishing whether it is innate or may be developed. Then programs should focus on quality education for the total human being, and be flexible enough to stimulate and encourage creative expression. A bibliography of related publications is included.

Institutions of higher education emphasize achievement-oriented social styles evolving from an accepted philosophy that stresses energy, compromise and pluralism as means to such goals as power, fame and wealth. The success of a student is based not only upon his academic achievement but also his adherence to these institutional social values. Today's society is challenging higher education to train experts in technological and electronic fields while youths seek new relationships between administration, faculty, education, society, and themselves. Current pressures are exposing the  limitations of education's social function at a time when colleges and universities are experiencing some internal uncertainty. These combined forces might effect several changes on the campus, including (1) changes in organization and administration of colleges and universities, especially greater involvement of students in institutional governance and academic policy formulation, (2) interdisciplinary studies combined with field work, linking fields to each other and bringing the campus to the community, and (3) changes in student-faculty relationships, where students assume more responsibility for their education and are given opportunities to develop both intellectually and emotionally.

It is becoming evident that today's students have chosen to depart from these expectations, since growing numbers of them are entering college with an already high degree of intellectual independence and social autonomy. The usually traumatic process of breaking away from paternalism and developing a personal identity would be smoother if college experiences had greater impact on students' personality characteristics and room for their interests and values. Students should be accorded an increasing degree of freedom and responsibility, accompanied by gradually decreasing  supervisory guidance, in order to intelligently evaluate their values, develop self-reliance, and learn to make responsible decisions. The individuality of a student will slowly emerge when he tests his values against those of a wide variety of other individuals and groups. The university has the dual role of preparing its students scholastically and making knowledge relevant to personal development and social progress. It should provide environments which stimulate creative expression by students who determine their own standards of community behavior and deal with infractions of these standards in the classroom and on the rest of the campus.

        "description":"There are approximately 350,000 full-time college and university professors of varied educational backgrounds distributed among 2,000 institutions differing in size, purpose and level. A college professor spends an average of 12 to 15 hours a week teaching and the remainder of his time preparing lectures, grading papers, keeping records, attending meetings and seeing students. The teaching time of the graduate faculty member is almost half that of the college professor, allowing him time to conduct other scholarly activities, mainly research. Many observers feel that if teaching and research were rewarded proportionately, the \"publish or perish\" requirement for non-tenured faculty would be eliminated and more committed individuals would be attracted to faculty positions. A recent  study of faculty members of 10 ranking US graduate institutions reveals that over 50% believe that interdisciplinary organization would result in greater faculty utilization and student development, yet 80% reported that their disciplines were organized along departmental lines. On the basis of commitment and interest in pure versus applied studies, 4 types of faculty were identified: teacher, scholar-researcher, demonstrator, and consultant; how they are utilized varies with individual institutional needs. Inadequate grading and credit systems, outdated lecture methods and class schedules hinder faculty self-renewal and growth. Innovative educational approaches are suggested for more effective utilization of faculty talents and intellectual stimulation of students. (WM)",

An important developmental stage during late adolescence is the consolidation of identity. In today's era of social change, a student finds individual development difficult because he may resist roles already accepted by society, and college environments may or may not help him in his search for a self-fulfilling role. A student's personality and his sharing of perceptions and values of the world with others links him to a subculture group. A comparison of subculture groups at different campuses was made--based on  personality types and the extent to which students identified with their respective institutions -- in order to identify important attributes that produce a common environment or set of values. Findings reveal that (1) 90% of college students value college in terms of social and monetary gains--the degree is more important than the education it is supposed to reflect, (2) some subgroups form through residential proximity or family social status and others through major fields of study, and (3) there are two major forms of subcultural deviant behavior: political activists (who confront society) and disaffiliates (who withdraw from society); both are considered as alienated groups seeking distinctive identities.

If the university is to survive this era of rapid social change, new educational alternatives must be considered. At some institutions educational philosophy has shifted toward affective education, an approach that encourages informal faculty-student relationships and in which the accumulation of knowledge is combined with the use of knowledge as a means to personal fulfillment. More of these programs need to be established. Much faculty resistance to change stems from a lack of data on innovative developments. Their workload could be reduced and time spent in creative activities if students  were taught by the tutorial method and allowed to study independently. Workshops on educational change would provide opportunities for specialists to utilize research data for improving the local university situation, and research and development centers could test concepts of significance to a particular institution. College administration should adopt industry's systems approach, in which decentralized leadership is emphasized and status is determined more by achievement than by position. Federal research and development centers are conducting research on educational innovations and, if the federal government supports change, changes will eventually occur. Colleges and universities should be prepared for this challenge. (WM)",

Many involuntary transfers might have remained at their original campuses but had to leave because of academic dismissals, health and financial problems, or other matters over which they had no control. Voluntary transfers described the city of Davis as lacking in intellectual and cultural activities, and considered other Davis students to be politically apathetic. UCLA was not felt to be completely unsatisfactory but thought to lack strong programs in some fields and situated too close to home. The majority of voluntary transfer students from both Davis and UCLA  went to Berkeley and, unlike the involuntary groups, felt a need for added intellectual and cultural stimulation through lectures, concerts, poetry reading, or serious discussion on controversial topics. Santa Barbars transfers were all voluntary and most dissatisfied with their campus, which was described as isolated, with poor living arrangements and a too social atmosphere. At the time of interviews, students had completed their freshman year and had transferred by the spring of their second year in college. (WM)",

At Berkeley there are approximately 3,000 of these non-conformist college dropouts, 151 of whom volunteered to participate in a socio-psychological study by responding to an interview questionnaire and several psychological instruments. A random sample of 56 Berkeley students was used as a reference group. A comparison of study data reveals, along with contrasting personality differences, that the non-students' creative and intellectual dispositions are positively related to their vocational choices and that regular students tend to follow the dictates of  family, school and society regarding their careers. The formation of the dropout subculture may have been precipitated by society's failure to accommodate their individual developmental needs by easing their transition into responsible adulthood. Social withdrawal is their answer to a rigidity in higher education offerings that conflicts with their intellectual and creative interests. Their alienation reflects an awareness of the low marketability, yet highly competitive nature in our society of the creative or fine arts, and the need for opportunity of expression in current academic structures.

The highly intelligent students demand a voice in determining policy and course content, and seek to replace the present university with a new institution characterized by academic and personal freedom. Some segments of the Reformist Left, or liberals, include black and white reformist-minded students and faculty. Student activists in this group press for limited reforms in academic, non-academic and governmental matters, frequently  in an abrasive way, and faculty demands involve higher salaries and better working conditions. The Nostalgic Right is composed of older professors and alumni who oppose any functional changes or innovative programs, and make demands only when their institution veers away from the \"status quo.\" They maintain that teaching and scholarly research are proper univeristy functions. The Upright Right, or far-right group, are citizens from off campus who consider themselves to be morally strong and righteous, and advocate the preservation of law and order as well as the protection of everyone's \"public decency.\" Their demands are essentially counter-demands.

He has had to accept, at the level of consciousness, the ideals and values of US society while actually being continuously rejected by the same society through various forms of discrimination. He has had to organize his life in recognition of the fact that structured racism within US society denies him of many opportunities to participate in it as a full-fledged citizen. On the basis of his personal experience it has been difficult to differentiate whether white acceptance is based on his true personality or on assumptions that he has \"stereotyped\" Negro habits, feelings and attitudes. He experiences an inner struggle concerning which of 2 roles to play, one that is expected of him and another that is his natural self, for  whites who fail to understand what it really means to be a Negro in US society. At much loss to his psychological stability, he has suppressed this conflice in the past and accepted a role that fits into the societal structure. Today's black students, suffering from this imposed inner torment of choosing between personal dignity through conscious role-playing or through effecting a change in society to improve actual experience, have decided on the latter and are rejecting education which does not relate to their individual development as citizens and as human beings. Their demands for a share in an array of college decisions reflect a search for self-identity that is not \"programmed\" or expected by white society, but one that is individually and naturally developed.

Modern students call not for a traditional liberal learning but a learning directed to action, to improving the social order and the environment. Colleges can achieve a new synthesis of liberal and professional learning by making graduate and undergraduate professional education more humane and intellectual, adding a devotion to social purpose to traditional academic studies, and providing a new path to liberal education through some of the insights and methods of transformed professional education. At SUNY Buffalo, the 7 Faculties have been reorganized to include within each Faculty the applied and the theoretical fields. The faculty is thus reminded of social and moral implications  of their work, the relatedness rather than the compartmentalization of knowledge. The new spirit, a new kind of romanticism, captivating many students and faculty, is part of an intense exploration of individual freedom. Liberal learning should use this energy in turning its intelligence upon nature, society and history to see how institutions can be bettered. Concern for service, tempered by a sense of history, enhances the academic purposes of a university, though it can best serve as an intellectual base, not an arena, of action. Universities should project themselves toward social vocation, the fusing of perception and awareness, based on liberal learning. (JS)",

In 1966, 59% and in 1967, 71% of the ISSP class went on to graduate school. The original plan involved 8 weeks of intensive post-baccalaureate training but in 1968 it was modified to include students who had completed their sophomore and junior years, and to add an 8-week faculty audit program for Negro college professors wishing to strengthen their educational and teaching abilities. Repeated involvement in ISSP appears to be the most effective and least expensive means of developing teachers and administrators qualified for  appointment at white institutions who may also return to strengthen predominantly black colleges. ISSP, essentially a stop-gap effort, is funded by the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford Foundation, but massive federal support is required for similar programs since many foundations lack enough money for and interest in establishing them. The black academic community wants to join in the control, teaching and sponsorship of programs such as ISSP. Integration of graduate school staffs, 91% of which are currently white, would help to establish fruitful relationships between black and white professors and institutions as well as create environments that would benefit disadvantaged students both academically and psychologically.

In 1963, a multidisciplinary Special Students Program was established at UCLA which provided 1 year of support to 23 Negro and other minority students working toward a Master's degree. Only one-fourth of the group progressed satisfactorily. Weaknesses in the program were identified as its financial support pattern, the quality of advising,  orientation and tutoring, and the means and criteria used for recruitment. It was also felt that heavy recruitment of students from southern Negro colleges removed the ablest and most needed graduates from these institutions. Efforts were then concentrated on Black, Mexican American and American Indian students in northern and western states, and in 1966 a 4-year Masters Opportunity Program was established which incorporated improvements in selection and recruitment. Of 21 students, only 1 failed academically. A common assumption has been that disadvantaged students need to correct academic deficiencies in order to enter graduate school, but this program proved that there is a larger number of minority students who are well qualified for graduate work if there is greater insight as to  what they need to succeed.

An evaluation of the first year's efforts reveals that (1) there is a large number of disadvantaged students at the graduate level, but white institutions would not welcome a majority of minority group students on campus, (2) although the students would not have met traditional admission requirements, they were not significantly deficient, (3) more than 80% of the students performed at a respectable academic level, (4) the programs have not directly influenced  change on the 4 campuses, and (5) some participating black students are not satisfied with the quality of education they are receiving. It is felt that white institutions should change the compensatory approach to graduate-level instruction for minority groups from one of white orientation to one which utilizes the black experience as an educational resource. Black-oriented programs would focus on historical and cultural events concerning black, white, rich and poor people, and, to balance current emphases on Western Europe, studies would be included on Latin America, Africa and Asia.

A semantic differential scale was constructed for the 4 characteristics, and 5 disability labels were assigned to each child: orthopedically handicapped, mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, culturally deprived, and normal. Tapes of the 2 interviews were used in an experiment to study how dialects and disability labels would interact to affect conclusions drawn by 100 college juniors about the personal characteristics of the boys. Results showed that the disability labels had no meaningful effect upon the semantic differential scores. Semantic differential ratings  on the personality scale for the interviews revealed no significant differences, but while mean scale scores for the 4 characteristics on the Caucasian child's tape did not differ, the personality scale mean for the Negro child's tape was higher than the other three characteristics. Later, 128 college juniors who had not participated in the experiment were asked to differentiate transcripts of the tapes according to race of interviewee. There was little evidence of ability to identify the race of either pupil from his verbal behavior, which suggests that negative r2 which suggests that negative inferences made in the experiment about the Negro child were probably caused by dialectical features of the taped interview. It may be that linguistic cues supplied by dialect are strong enough to  minimize labeling effects. (WM)",

        "description":"Experienced and knowledgeable artists, scholars and educators met to discuss the fundamental issues of dance as a performing art and as a discipline in higher education. During Phase I of the conference, participants explored the role and nature of dance in education and developed curricular guidelines. A blueprint for a 25-year projection of undergraduate and graduate dance curricula was constructed during Phase II. The dance major model involves a 4-year undergraduate program providing for continuous study of movement and choreography, history, philosophy, notation, and music. Related arts such as music, theater and visual arts would become essential components of the program. Major requirements would be flexible enough so that gifted students could concentrate on performance  and choreography while others prepare to specialize at the graduate level in history, notation, ethnic dance or related areas. A flexible graduate program would offer opportunities for specialization in one aspect of dance, and independent research or creative projects designed to meet the student's talents and needs. At some universities, participation of the dance department with a professional dance company would enrich curricula and benefit students and communities. The report suggests standards for faculty, facilities, and supporting funds that would ensure quality education, and proposes areas for research that would contribute to dance literature, current and future curricula, and teaching techniques.

Related purposes of the study were to determine whether the value patterns of faculty-selected &quot;ideal&quot; students differed from those of average students, to gain insight into faculty values by involving them in the study, and to assess the relationship between student values and background factors such as academic performance, prior educational experience, religious practice, and educational and life goals. Three of 4 hypotheses were confirmed: (1) that faculty-selected &quot;ideal&quot; students would have better  high school grades, college GPAs, College Board scores and scores on intellectual-aesthetic values than &quot;non-ideals,&quot; that they frequently attended intellectual and fine arts events, but did not differ significantly from &quot;non-ideals&quot; on any other variable, (2) that background factors studied would affect student values in such a way that intellectual values would be positively correlated with academic ability, achievement indicators and related interests, and (3) that attendance at Mass, reception of Holy Communion and frequency of confession would be correlated with religious and moral values. The 4th hypothesis, that no inter-school differences in values held by students in the two colleges would be found, was not confirmed. Recommendations for future research are included.  (WM)",

        "description":"In a self-directed student group, learning activities are controlled and directed by the students themselves. This approach to learning was investigated at Hope College to: (1) explore the amount and patterns of interaction observable in small self-directed groups, (2) assess conditions and events in group interaction which enhance or inhibit learning, and (3) assess other desirable learning outcomes besides course achievement which accompany this approach to learning. All 54 students enrolled in the social psychology course in the 1966 fall semester were randomly divided into groups of 6 to study independently. Following initial pre-testing, course instructions, and distribution of course materials, students were dismissed for the semester except for voluntary group meetings  once a week or more and total class meetings with the instructor approximately once every 2 weeks. From behind a one-way mirror the instructor made observations of the groups in action and student assistants conducted Bales Interaction Process Analyses. With other groups in the second semester different categories were used for the interaction analysis and groups were videotaped. It was observed that interaction was plentiful and effective, that there were identifiable factors enhancing or hindering learning, and that the benefits of self-directed study extend beyond the content learning achieved. Findings confirmed the value and productivity of this approach to college learning, and indicated the feasibility of its economy in terms of instructor time and required classroom facilities.

Students were classified into 3 levels of study: first year (completed less than 1 full year of required study for an advanced or first-professional degree), terminal year (expected to complete all doctoral or professional degree requirements by June 30, 1967), and intermediate year (between the two levels above). The report has 6 tables showing actual counts for 706 reporting institutions, which accounted for about 95% of fall 1966 advanced degree enrollments. Table 1 applies to students pursuing master's and doctor's degrees and provides national summaries  of enrollments. Table 2 gives similar data on enrollments leading to first-professional degrees. Table 3 classifies enrollments by subject matter specialization. In Table 4 enrollments for master's and doctor's degrees are shown by level, sex of student, and attendance status at each institution listed, by state, and Table 5 provides similar data for first-professional enrollment. An institutional listing of enrollments in each field of study is provided in Table 6. It is estimated that student enrollments rose 9% from fall 1965 (535,000) to fall 1966 (583,000), 60% of which were reported by public institutions. Two appendices provide additional information.

The Italian university provides training in law, economics, commerce and philosophy within a rigid structure which permits entrance only to a select few, yet Italy's expanding economic and technological development requires about 100,000 people trained in scientific and technological fields. Concerned government and education officials are attempting to implement changes that will relate the university to modern society but several factors impede meaningful university reform. Major problems inhibiting change include an unstable political system, traditionalist professors who fear the loss or prestige and political  influence attached to their positions, the lack of autonomy of the universities (their functions are determined by law), the concentration of higher education institutions in Northern Italy only, a shortage of professors, and a growing student protest movement. Italy's 1959 10-year development plan provided for funds that would facilitate educational reform. Since that time several revisions and extensions have been made by several governments, but the original bill has yet to be passed by parliament. The student movement is making some impact with protests strengthened by a growing political power, but many problems remain. The report offers recommendations for additional study and research.

A study of ongoing programs was conducted to analyze new educational techniques, determine how they affect institutions, and consider the implications which these developments have for higher education. Interviews were held with 175 persons concerning 16 kinds of programs at 13 public institutions that are individually unique yet have similar basic characteristics. Generally, the programs are: (1) educational development programs -- some help faculty develop new teaching methods, and others coordinate instructional improvement and curriculum  revision, (2) offices of instructional resources -- a combination of agencies that coordinate and offer course development, audiovisual, testing, and other services to faculty, (3) research centers -- agencies conducting in-depth studies on 1 aspect of educational development for the whole university, and (4) projects -- departmental activities funded through any of the 3 programs above. It was concluded that these kinds of programs will continue to have administrative support, but further evaluation should be conducted to determine how they affect each institution's overall academic program. Their continued existence may depend on how successfully they can be incorporated into current teaching practices. (WM)",

The shortage of evaluative research and criteria of effectiveness preclude making a qualitative judgment on the relative success of the programs or offering a model program. The commonest program is the series or block of remedial courses with many variations. Another approach provides special services such as tutoring, extra counseling, free lunches, free transportation, legal aid, financial help, or part-time employment. A third method involves complete revision of grading, probation, retention, tracking, disqualification, registration, prerequisite, and other policies. (This method frequently improves the climate of the whole school and  its near-invisibility is preferable to overt labeling.) Combinations of these three systems are widely used, along with special programs and courses to meet local needs (e.g., African studies). This report lists advantages and disadvantages of the various methods. Colleges are also examining such special aids as learning laboratories and are seeking qualified staff from minority groups. Student responses revealed more similarities than differences among them, a pervasive money problem, lack of study time, the degree of correspondence of expectation with reality, a general approval of the institution, etc. Eight recommendations are offered to the Board of Governors of California Community Colleges and 20 suggestions for the colleges themselves.

California Psychological Inventory (CPI) showed a significant range in personality traits from high to low ability students. The values (measured by the Allport, Vernon, Lindzey Scale) were compared for the Napa students and a nationwide sample. The three groups of Napa students were tested in September and May for changes in personality and performance. Of six hypotheses, four were rejected and two were inconclusive. The general findings were: (1) Napa students are comparable in performance to entering freshmen at other institutions; (2) diversity within the  college ranges over 67 percentile points on the ACE Exam; (3) there is great diversity of performance on Authority and CPI scales among the three ability groups; (4) by the same scales, there were significant changes in personality between September and May; and (5) there were significant changes in performance on the STEP Reading Exam among low-ability students. A more intensive study should be made of non-cognitive changes during the college years, for, although they seem to have no value as academic predictors, they are central to the process of education. Non-intellective factors, as opposed to academic, obviously have more influence and impact on both personality and performance than most educators are aware of. (HH)",

Nonurban junior colleges, by correcting these lacks, may help to stem this migration--in spite of a shortabe of faculty, funds, and space. Among their unique problems are: (1) the region often depends on a single industry; (2) students must travel farther to school or pay for housing; (3) with less vocational guidance, students are unaware of broader opportunities; (4) faculty is hard to hire because of lower pay and distance from city amenities; (5) families have little income and less interest in continuing education; (6) the area has a meager tax base. These factors combine to limit the comprehensiveness of the rural college. Of the 600 rural colleges, 40% are in population centers  of 10,000 or less, with limited chances for employment. Transfer programs vary little; enrollment in agriculture and natural resources is growing; the most popular courses are business, physical science, health, trades, and industry. This report discusses the importance of lay advisory committees (general and occupational), to develop community interest and emphasizes the necessity for more counseling in the choice of an occupation and its course requirements. The college's community services must include not only the usual culture and recreation programs, but also such less common services as soil analysis and commercial consultation help. The rural college needs more research on student characteristics and its own unique role, according to its resources. (HH)",

        "description":"This paper deals with the legal aspects of student rights and of the various forms of expression (riots, demonstrations, speeches, and writings) pertinent to student activism, militancy, or agitation. It cites examples of such activities, along with decisions handed down by school authorities and local, state, and federal courts. The most recent case reviewed is Barker v. Hardway in the spring of 1968. Following the trends indicated by these decisions, the author offers guidelines to college administrators. They cover general principles such as avoidance of ambiguity or inconsistency, wide dissemination of information on the college rules, the extent of authority over behavior on or off the campus, the distinction between substantive and procedural due process, and the proper  conduct of formal and informal hearings. Recommendations include: (1) a spirit of reason on the part of all concerned, (2) the formulation and enforcement of just rules and regulations for freedom of expression on campus, and (3) the channelling of student dissent into constructive activism, leading to increased academic freedom for all.

The unit costs per square foot vary from $18.00 for warehousing to $38.00 for the performing arts center. Total building construction costs are $19,779,000. Site development costs are $3,826,000, to which must be added $1,000,000 for movable equipment and furniture, $2,228,000 for assorted professional fees, and a reserve of $1,017,000. This makes a grand total of $27,850,000, of which $19,850,000 must be raised by a bond issue. The various departments planned for are: agriculture and natural resources,  arts and letters, business education, campus centers, commons and student store, communications, forum building, health and physical education, health sciences, life sciences, materials resources, mathematics and engineering, physical science, social science, student personnel, technical and industrial, campus and district administration, and a warehouse and maintenance center.

        "description":"The speaker discusses two methods of teaching. He describes the data transmission system with its use of technology (computer assistance, audio-tutoring, etc.) as merely an updating of the traditional attempt by the teacher to impart a body of subject matter and by the student to absorb and store it for future retrieval. Opposed to this transmission and storage of data is the method of acquisition and assimilation of information. The three main differences are: (1) source of initiative in the educational process, (2) primary criterion for the organization of data, and (3) predominant behavioral outcome. In the traditional system, the teacher takes the initiative, the main criterion is relating bits of information to other bits, and the resulting behavior is mainly manipulative.  In the acquisition method, the student does the initiating, the main criterion is the accumulated experience and present understanding of the learner, and the dominant resulting behavior is associative. The speaker feels both models are valid and should be used, but that machines do a better job of transmitting data than a teacher can, while the teacher who performs as a motivator, counselor, consultant will never become obsolete. In summary, the student in a traditional system is a manipulator, adapting all things to himself; in the acquisition system, he more likely relates all things with himself--the distinction being between adapting to and relating with. The speaker illustrates his point from his own teaching experience. (HH)",

Selected tests from the Comparative Guidance and Placement (CGP) Core and Research Batteries, and the Tool and Form Matching subtests from the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) were administered to high school seniors or to freshmen entering three Washington State community colleges. The subjects' scores on these tests, along with their WPC scores, constituted the input data for two correlation matrices. One correlation matrix, based on the high school subjects, consisted of WPC variables, the two GATB subtests, and the CGP Research Battery. The second matrix was based on  the community college subjects and consisted of WPC variables and the CGP Core Battery variables. The two matrices were subjected to three separate sequential predictor selection analyses: (1) the prediction of each CGP Research Battery and GATB subtest from WPC variables: (2) the prediction of each CGP Core Battery test from WPC variables; and (3) the prediction of each WPC variable from CGP Core Battery subtests. From the results of the predictor selection analyses, ten CGP variables and the two GATB subtests appeared to warrant further investigation as potentially useful predictors. All of the WPC tests except Reading Speed showed relatively high predictability from the CGP Core Battery. (Author/HH)",

The advantages of this shift from senior year testing were to provide guidance data for earlier, more extensive use in high school and to make these data available to colleges at the time they actually make admissions decisions. Because of this shift, statistical changes were required in scoring and prediction formulas. This report summarizes the following three changes: (1) generating standard score weights for the quantitative skills subsections; (2) restandardizing high school means and standard deviations of the WPC tests; and (3) conversion formulas translating WPC raw scores into standard scores, and  composite score formulas and derivations.

They are properly viewed as the means of providing educational opportunity for all, including the low achiever. The open-door policy, however, will be valid only if students can achieve their goals. Their success will determine whether the door is really open or merely revolving. Community colleges must therefore determine what low-achieving students are going to learn in remedial programs, the conditions of learning, and how the learning can be evaluated. Boards of trustees and parents can put pressure on both administrators and instructors to evaluate their efforts with the low achiever. This evaluation is essential if only to show the general ineffectiveness of  current developmental or remedial programs. Junior colleges will have to face the challenge of demonstrated student learning as the one criterion for the success of any program for the low achiever. In short, the open-door policy is justified only if the college provides valuable educational experiences for all students admitted and makes student learning a major institutional goal. (HH)",

Although initial enrollment was expected to be small, 150 applications were received; in 1967, enrollment was nearly 800; in one or two years, an enrollment of over 1000 is predicted. Broward County, Manatee, and Gulf Coast Junior Colleges now offer career pilot programs. Each program requires about 200 hours of flight time, costs the student about $3000, and offers 68 to 78 semester hours of mathematics, social science, humanities, business, and physical education, besides aviation courses in flight  theory, aircraft development, aerophysics, air navigation, aerodynamics, meteorology, air transportation, engines and structure theory, aircraft systems, aviation safety, and radio communications. The program leads to an associate degree in science or arts. Flying for the airlines is the initial goal of most students, but many switch to some other job in flying, such as corporate, rescue service, charter, or agricultural pilot.

Among the academic faculty, the men advocate more involvement than the women; among the applied faculty, the reverse is true. As the level of education of the faculty member increases, so does his interest in administrative decisions, those with advanced degrees being better trained for such participation and more knowledgeable about the problems of an educational institution. Administrators should encourage the  applied faculty to take more interest, if not in institutional decision making, at least in such other faculty activities as council and committee work.

The attempts to prevent segregation--regional distribution of programs, open rather than district enrollment, encouragement of non-resident enrollment, colleges with special programs--have been ineffective. Enrollment still reflects the ethnic make-up of the area and is intensified by current separatist movements. Although segregation need not mean inferior education, experience has shown that it does. Programs for the disadvantaged, low-ability, and minority groups are  inadequate, as no one knows what to teach them or how to evaluate what they do. Increased research in special education, funds for program development and student aid, and thorough evaluation of the programs are essential. Lack of attention to non-Western cultures is a parallel problem. The racial mix of employees is not well-balanced at the administrative or academic levels, but is better at the non-academic level. Lack of qualified people is one reason for this condition. In intercollegiate athletics, in participant programs like journalism, theatre, and music, and in apprenticeship programs, prejudice is more overt.

        "description":"The author suggests that higher education become a service for students, not an obstacle course that excludes rather than includes. The \"paper student,\" as shown by his transcript, is poorly described. No account is taken, for instance, of his family background--low income, lack of occupational status and geographic or social mobility, indifference to or scorn of higher education. His self-image is average; he is economically, politically, and morally conservative; he lacks intellectual or social self-confidence; he aspires only to a middle occupation, and even that without settled goal. He must be guided toward compatibility of education and vocation and helped to develop self-acceptance, emotional balance, and maturity. His search for respect includes academic, social, and  vocational success at his own level, free of parental restraint. The punch-card processing of students in \"the system\" discourages all these developments. Adjustment problems are frequently less severe for students in college residence than for those living at home, where normal emancipation conflicts with family values, and where the nightly return to a non-supportive environment negates much of his growth. Institutional rigidity (grades, attendance) may also stifle his search for self-determination. The college can offset these influences by broadening admission criteria, by relating programs more closely to daily life (as opposed to vocation), by defining and following educational objectives that meet modern expectations of individual development.

It was also found that failing grades were received in transfer courses far more frequently than in occupationally-centered courses, and that few failing grades were received in college-level mathematics or science courses with stiff prerequisite requirements. A profile for a typical failing student includes: (1) a tendency to select a non-science, liberal arts, transfer program, (2) inadequate high school preparation, and (3) a need for remedial work in English and math. Recommendations include expansion of the college's remedial program and increased  efforts by the college counseling staff in group counseling, &quot;emergency&quot; mid-term counseling for students receiving F grades, and improvement in vocational guidance.

The staff prepared working papers on each problem and agreed on certain recommendations: (1) establish the unique  identity of technical education, (2) inform a wider public, (3) clarify articulation with universities and high schools, (4) devise a satisfactory vertical structure for technical courses, (5) encourage supporting legislation, (6) refine techniques to study supply and demand, (7) continue study of regulatory agencies, (8) examine motivations of high school students, (9) reduce the attrition rate, (10) help teachers keep up to date (math, science, technology), (11) improve pre-service teacher training, (12) anticipate, rather than accommodate, technological change, (13) explore work-study programs, (14) publicize successful curricula, (15) continually evaluate program objectives and relevancy, (16) develop teaching aids, (17) welcome new teaching methods.

There were also different ideas on the role of the president's wife: she should be much in the background, but accept responsibility when appropriate;  serve as a leader of other women when necessary; understand education in general; see that her husband's home life provides respite from his pressures and problems; calmly accept public scrutiny and even criticism; refrain from speaking out on college operations; take part in faculty wives' activities; attend to any social obligations that create or contribute to good college and community relations; be concerned with her public appearance, attitude, and conduct; involve herself discreetly in cultural and civic affairs; be socially aware and flexible; retain her individuality.

Eight separate cost elements were developed for each of the library's cost centers or service facilities from actual cost data provided by the University Controller's Office. These cost elements were: salaries and benefits, books, periodicals, binding, supplies and expenses, operating and maintenance, building and equipment depreciation, and University administration. Statistics covering circulation by user groups and campus population distribution by user groups were collected for each by the individual facilities, and  these circulation and population statistics were then used to make a preliminary allocation of the specified cost elements to the four user groups. Following this preliminary allocation, the manner for allocating the cost elements to user groups was outlined. In order to aid the allocation of cost elements, five special studies were made which covered: circulation, population distribution, the cataloging and acquisition divisions, salaries and benefits, and space utilization. The final task performed was the allocation of cost elements for each facility or cost center to the appropriate user group or groups. (Author/JB)",

Sources were both interpersonal (family, friends, high school personnel, college representatives) and impersonal (college catalogs, guides, and the mass media). Personal and environmental data were collected to form a set of potential predicators. Four variables emerged as predictors of information-source response: (1) physical distance from the information object (operationally, the respondent's state of residence in relation to Syracuse University), (2) psychological distance (operationally, whether any member of the immediate family had attended  Syracuse), (3) the number of friends and adult acquaintances who attend(ed) Syracuse, (4) and sex. These variables chiefly predicted whether interpersonal or impersonal sources would be dominant; intermedia preferences were ambiguous because of the rarity with which media sources were cited. The study affirms the importance of interpersonal sources and suggests factors on which their use is partly contingent. (Author/CC)",

        "description":"The costs of providing access to serial literature in four university research libraries were examined in this study, and a methodology was developed for comparing borrowing costs with the costs of acquisition, cataloging, maintenance, and circulation. Mathematical models are provided by which any library can determine at what frequency of use of a serial title it becomes less expensive to acquire a photocopy of an article from another library when needed than to subscribe to and maintain a file of the title. Cost data from the four libraries, when inserted into the models, indicate a strong case for borrowing low demand serial items. Study findings must be qualified because the four libraries are not a random sample of all research libraries, and no value was placed on having a  collection available for browsing or on the shortened access time involved with local ownership. It is concluded that in order to give the research library a choice between borrowing and owning little used serials a national lending library system for serial literature needs to be developed. Appendixes include: details on the library surveys, mathematical analyses performed for the study, suggestions for a lending library system, and cost models for a specific serial title. (JB)",

In order to guide the expansion so that it results in maximum accommodation to potential library users, the System engaged a professional research organization to design the allocation of unserved areas to existing library facilities in a way that reflects the natural orientation and convenience of the population. The configurations resulting from such an allocation are termed \"natural library service zones\" - zones within which it may  be presumed that residents are oriented toward the library within the zone rather than toward any other library. Part I of this report describes the working concepts and methodology used in deriving the natural service zones. Part II, in the form of an annotated map, depicts the boundaries of the zones.

Ten children (male and female, Negro and Caucasian, 8 to 24 months old) received intellectual stimulation for 1 hour a day, 5 days a week, for 1 year. A matched control group received no stimulation. Pretests and posttests were administered. The training program emphasized language development, symbolic representation, and concept formation. The results showed that sample values of the experimental group  were superior to those of the control group in 25 of 26 variables tested, eight being significant at the .05 level. IQ scores of the experimental group were greater than those of the control group, and the difference was significant at the .05 level. Sample values of the experimental group exceeded those of the control group on 14 of 15 language subtests, two being significant at the .05 level. On tests administered to assess conceptual development, the experimental group was consistently superior to the control group. Followup studies should be done to determine long term effectiveness of the program. References and tabulated data are included. (JS)",

Subjects were 132 kindergarten children, divided into six classes by ability, who were assessed individually prior to and after 6 months of the program. To measure growth, the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were employed.

        "description":"Since educational deficiencies do exist in disadvantaged children, the emphasis should be on prevention so that compensation need not play the major role it does today. Preschool programs are being effected in primary schools, nursery schools, community centers, and even private homes. The controversy is no longer whether or not such programs can help preclude developmental deficits. It is whether the programs should be child-centered or have a uniform, structured curriculum. This paper is intended to present a rationale for the structure of infant education to be used by teachers, paraprofessionals, and parents. Emphasis should be on language and conceptual development, because disadvantaged children appear particularly deficient in these areas. The child should be 10 to 12  months old when the program is initiated. Suggestions for the training of the infant in language and conceptual tasks and activities are presented after a brief discussion of the rationale for the use of such activities. (WD)",

Research on the contribution of attitude, temperament, and environmental climate in nurturing the creative potential of the young child is small. Some trends, however, do appear in the existing studies, especially adult studies in which not only the personality of the creative individual is explored, but his childhood is reexamined. Although the relationships between childhood experience, personal attitudes, and creativity often appear inconsistent and even contradictory across individuals, it has  been shown that creative people often (1) have great confidence in themselves, (2) are introverted and withdrawn, (3) are very intellectually curious, (4) are nonconforming and independent, (5) had a pleasant but not necessarily close relationship with their parents, (6) did receive support, respect, and relative autonomy from their parents, and (7) were allowed early to exercise their own judgment within limits of consistent discipline.

        "description":"A study was conducted to see if children in a 6-week Head Start program in Canton, Ohio would make greater cognitive gains in an academically structured curriculum than in a less structured one. With the exception of the educational program, all other aspects of the traditional Head Start program remained the same for all children. Inservice training programs for teachers and aides were conducted and parent-teacher meetings were encouraged. Fifteen children in each of eight Bereiter-Engelmann program centers and 15 in each of eight control centers were pretested and posttested on the Caldwell Preschool Inventory and the Engelmann Concept Inventory. Results of statistical analysis of the data by matched pairs showed that, over a short term, children in the structured curriculum  made greater gains than those in the unstructured program. A followup study was not attempted so that it was not learned whether gains would be sustained after a year or more in school. Other study findings suggest that elementary school teachers, rather than those trained for kindergarten, most easily adapt to structured preschool programs and that neighborhood women may profitably be recruited and trained to be teacher aides. Further investigation into the nature of the optimal type of Head Start curriculum is urged. (MS)",

The combination of ITA and 2 years of PLDK produced the most effective results. Reading achievement after 2 years was  equal for both groups. The effects of PLDK on intellectual functioning are questionable. These findings must be viewed cautiously since (1) increments favoring the ITA and PLDK may not last through the third grade, and (2) present research does not suggest the same superiority of ITA as demonstrated in this project.

The groups were well-matched with one difference: children were either Ashkenazic (of European descent) or Sephardic (of Syrian descent). Families of both of these groups, however, had been in the United States for at least 25 years. Cognitive measures such as the Stanford-Binet, Columbia Mental Maturity Scale, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test were given to the children; parent attitude scales were given to the mothers. Additional data were collected on the educational and financial aspirations of the mothers for their children. Analysis of the data showed significant school readiness  differences. The Ashkenazic children, whose cultural background possibly supported academic achievement, were more prepared than the Sephardic children, whose training seemed to stress financial success. Study findings suggest that implicit cultural factors, aspirations, and mores affect children's school readiness, even when poverty and other disadvantages are absent. (MS)",

        "description":"This paper assumes that environmental inadequacy is the primary factor leading to progressive intellectual retardation and inability to cope in a complex society. An intervention project begun in 1966 was designed to develop cognitive, motivational, personal style, and physical variables, which are functional categories related to competence. Subjects included 60 disadvantaged preschoolers (the \"target\" children), their younger siblings (the experimental groups), and their mothers. Group I (the maximum impact group) involved the mother and the target child at the Early Training Center. The mother's sequential program consisted of skill development, observation, and participation as a teacher. Aptitudes of skills for environmental mastery and sustaining attitudes for continued  growth were developed in target children. In Group II, the target child was the only member of the family enrolled in the program. Families in Group III (the home visitor group) had no contact with the center, but a home-visiting teacher described procedures. A natural environmental group was chosen to match demographic characteristics of treatment families. In 2 1/2 years, younger siblings whose mothers participated were superior in all comparisons. Analysis of psychometric data on target children was significantly greater than those where no parental contact was maintained. (DO)",

The &quot;control&quot; group consisted of 64 children who had been eligible for a Head Start program. They roughly matched a group of Head Start (HS) children in IQ scores, age, and socioeconomic level. On two occasions, with about 83 days between testings, the Stanford-Binet and Preschool Inventory tests were administered to the control group. The same tests had been administered to the HS group in a study by Temp and Anderson in 1967. The control group did not have a statistical gain in Stanford-Binet IQ scores, whereas the HS group did have. On the Preschool Inventory both groups showed statistically significant gains in most  instances. The results support the position that the gains in the Stanford-Binet IQ scores were atrributable to Head Start practices and that the increases in the Preschool Inventory scores were attributable to maturation. The Preschool Inventory should be scored to allow for maturational differences. Tabulated data are included. (JS)",

The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Level of independence will differentiate ethnic groups. Ranking order will be Negro, Anglo, Mexican. (2) Level of independence will correlate positively with the following measures of social behavior: (a) teacher's estimated rank of child's social competence; (b) teacher's estimated rank of child's popularity; (c) interpersonal and communicative score; (d) status among peers; and (e) school adjustment. (3) Status among peers will be lower for high dependent girls than for high dependent boys. (4)  Intelligence will correlate positively with level of independence. (5) Achievement will correlate positively with level of independence. (6) Age will correlate positively with level of independence.

It was assumed prior to the study that there existed a continuum on which both the speaker and the dialect features could be located. Twelve of the 17 dialect features were analyzed. A correlation was found between dialect score (DS) and amount of education of the subject; the higher the education, the closer the speaker was to the standard English end of the continuum. A similar result was found between DS and  socioeconomic level. In another part of the study, one of the dialect features was intensively analyzed for the speech of 12 subjects.

Although all very young children lack this ability, the environment of the middle class child provides an opportunity so that as this child matures, the ability to think in abstract terms naturally develops. The environment of the disadvantaged child does not provide adequate opportunities for the development of this ability. In response to this need of disadvantaged children, a tutorial program was created with the goal of fostering abstract thinking. The program occupies only some 15 to 20 minutes of a nursery school day; but, as it is tutorial, it is effective because of the one-to-one teacher-pupil ratio. The teaching  techniques to be used in this program include (1) techniques for the development of cognitively directed perception, (2) techniques to facilitate the child's use and understanding of language, and (3) techniques to focus the child on developing problem solving skills. The several specific techniques within each of the above three broad topical areas are also delineated in the text of the paper. (WD)",

Subjects were 129 first and second graders enrolled in a lower-middle class all white school, an all Negro slum school, and an integrated lower-middle class school. All received test booklets with decals of a target figure (Negro teacher, white teacher, peer, or school) on each page, and a package of stickers on which self-figures were printed. They were directed to paste the self-figures in whatever position and at whatever distance from the target figure they chose. White subjects placed the self figures farther away from Negro targets than from white targets. Negro subjects placed themselves equally close to  white and Negro targets. Integrated Negroes placed themselves significantly closer to white-children targets than did segregated Negro subjects. Figure placement indicated integration accelerated a tendency for white subjects to move closer to Negro children targets as grade increased. Regardless of race, integrated subjects placed themselves closer to school than did segregated subjects. Because this study was preliminary and small, many interpretations exist and cannot be resolved for some findings. Further research is needed to compare the validity of alternative interpretations.

This summary of research studies in the field reports experimental and observational findings about behavior and characteristics typical of white middle class boys and girls between the ages of three and five. However, conflicting results of the research make firm generalizations impossible. It is suggested that standard tests of sex role preference and identification are of little value and may not be valid instruments. Although children were aware of and showed sex-appropriate behavior, the factors responsible  for this sex role typing have not been identified.

The self-contained classroom, found usually in the elementary grades, consists of one teacher with one grade-level class for the full day and for all subjects. The departmental approach, found at all levels, employs teachers to teach a particular subject or two only, and the pupils, during a school day, move from class to class. Team teaching occurs when two or more teachers share in teaching one particular group of students, usually in just one curricular area. Nongraded instruction enables students to advance in the curriculum according to their individual capacities. Perhaps most research in the grouping area has involved ability grouping, in which  students of a given grade are divided up according to degree of ability or achievement. Other within-grade organization has been attempted; for example, planned heterogeneous grouping and teachability grouping. The research in many of these areas is inconclusive and incomplete and fails to determine the contribution of the organizational plan being examined. (WD)",

In the present investigation of these units, an alleged phenomenon (the resistance of the hearer to perceive extraneous auditory stimuli) was employed. It was argued that this resistance caused the hearer to perceive the irrelevant stimulus, if at all, primarily at the juncture of major units. Also investigated was the interaction between the verbal materials used and the perception of the extraneous stimulus (a click). The subjects were eight kindergarten and eight second grade children. The verbal materials, spoken to the children by an adult, were sentences and nonsentence strings of words. Also clicking sounds were made. The children were asked to tell where in the sentence or string of words the  click occurred. The results indicated that a greater magnitude of displacement of the click from its actual position occurred for the sentences than for the nonsentence material. The younger children tended to preposition the click. In both age groups, there was a tendency for click location to be prepositioned in nonsentences and postpositioned in sentences. Also, as has been observed with adults, the preception of the click tended to migrate towards major unit boundaries in the sentence material. These boundaries were determined by Rulon Wells' immediate constituent analysis. (WD)",

Perhaps a reduction of the memory load required in the task would benefit the younger children more than the older children, because it would reduce the irrelevant stimulus dimensions of the task which bother younger children. The subjects for this study were 54 kindergarten and 54 second grade children. They were administered CI tasks of three levels of complexity and three  levels of memory load.

The project's objectives included (1) providing experiences for 4-year-old children from families in low socioeconomic areas that would prepare the children to cope adequately with the regular school program; (2) developing a &quot;Framework and Curriculum Objectives Outline for Prekindergarten&quot;; and (3) providing training and consultative assistance to preschool teachers. For the purposes of this project, the 4-year-olds were organized into units of 20, each unit having a lead teacher, a teacher assistant, and a teacher aid. Preschool specialists worked with these teachers. In order to measure the effectiveness of the preschool program, the performances of the prekindergarten children on various  tests were compared to the performance of Title I and non-Title I kindergarten children. The results of the testing and comparison showed that the prekindergarten children improved significantly in cognitive areas and language performance, and even frequently they compared favorably in performance to the kindergarten children.

The two objectives of this longitudinal testing were to describe the factorial organization of intelligence at the age levels tested and to observe changes in this organization as they occurred when the same subjects were measured repeatedly. The test battery included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Ammons Full Range Picture Vocabulary Test. Twelve  factors were discovered, overall. The overlapping appearance of some factors in two or more phases confirmed the idea of the existence of stable mental factors at the preschool level. Identification of two emergent factors supported the idea that intelligence tends to differentiate with increasing age and experience. (WD)",

In order for the economic planner to influence these rural families toward economic development, he must convince them of his genuine interest in the families' welfare. Programs of development in this region, therefore, will have to deal with this insulated resistance to change and cannot count on  family and church institutions to aid in the change processes designed to improve the economic conditions of Appalachia.

Interviews were conducted with 287 graduates in 13 states. About 70 percent entered post high school academic or training programs which approximately one half completed. Employment was frequently unrelated to training. One half of those interviewed were working for pay or profit, while keeping house and unpaid family jobs were the next highest categories of work. Family size and position in family had some relation to continuance of formal education for females. Education of fathers apparently had no significant effect, but gainful employment of mothers related positively to graduates' post high school plans. The  majority of the graduates did not speak an Indian language. Those who participated in school activities tended to enter post-secondary education programs. Many were dissatisfied with their present jobs and felt the need for further education. Indications were that information made available on post high school opportunities was inadequate. Study results suggested that Indians should have direct involvement in the initiation, planning, and execution of educational programs designed to aid in their own development. The questionnaire and interview guide used in the study are appended. (JH)",

Strengths mentioned are academic freedom, small numbers of children, an abundant supply of materials, close community interest, and the rural atmosphere. The needs listed include instructional leadership, specific goals and purposes, a compilation of ideas, inter-faculty visitations, and emphasis on student work.

A model to be applied in obtaining desired learning outcomes in other Mexican American classrooms was then formulated.

Pretesting revealed significant differences in vocabulary development and experiential background compared to an urban control population. Programs designed to improve instruction were developed in areas of parent-teacher communication, instructional excursions, pupil-team specialties, resource utilization, and individualized reading instruction. Second- and third-year evaluations of the project showed significant gains in vocabulary growth and reading achievement. One elementary school made extensive use of the amplified  telephone and established companion schools in New Mexico and New York City to offset the disadvantages of isolation. Materials developed in the course of the project are described. (JH)",

The goals of the 1965-68 Diverse Capacity Project conducted in the school system were (1) to understand cultural differences between Indians and Anglos, (2) to identify the problems of Indians in an Anglo-oriented school, (3) to modify the traditionally oriented textbook curriculum, and (4) to establish a satisfactory instructional organization to meet the needs of both children and teachers in the rural school setting. Teaching techniques such as a directed reading activity, a unit approach, and a non grading level organization were employed. The results were later evaluated with the use of achievement tests, which showed that Anglo achievement was significantly  superior to Indian achievement. Some conclusions were: (1) teachers of non-achievers are more inclined to find fault with the instructional program than with the children; (2) schools must involve all teachers in curriculum planning and selection; and (3) instructional programs must have greater priority over organizational plans. Achievement and attendance data are included. (CM)",

Daily activities and audio-visual materials were used to enlarge the children's vocabulary. The results were that by acquiring literacy in the mother tongue, the children were able to appreciate the value of their own culture, and Spanish was accepted as a medium of communication.

The teacher speaks one language while the child, often disadvantaged, speaks another. The ability to identify utterances is attributed to human tolerance called the phoneme concept, a generalization of a potentially infinite number of sounds into a small number of speech sound concepts or classes. When a group agrees on a body of phonemes, it shares a particular phonemic inventory. In learning a second language, the individual usually substitutes those sounds not existing in his own tongue with similar ones present in his own native inventory. A similar situation exists between standard English and its dialects. If a phoneme-grapheme correspondence is to be taught, the phonemes used as  reference patterns must be determined. The usual tests to determine auditory discrimination are based on inadequate phonetic knowledge. Teacher training should include dialectology, speech sound analysis, and the concept of phonemes. A good reading teacher must either learn the child's dialect or teach him the standard dialect as a second language. (WL)",

The findings are (1) that the public schools are an important element in the local politics of Chicago, (2) that the public schools have been influential both in educational policy and in receiving financial support from the business men of the community, (3) that several major civic organizations have been important factors in certain decisions affecting schools, (4) that the public schools  have been brought into cooperation with noneducational agencies to solve social problems of the city, (5) that teachers' organizations have been active since 1900, (6) that the personalities of certain individuals in the school system have influenced educational history, and (7) that population movements have influenced the public schools.

The key to installing an innovation is advanced planning coupled with active participation of all individuals who will be involved.

This suggested system relates revenues to expenditures so that the net cost to unrestricted income of vocational education, compensatory  education, special education, and pupil transportation is emphasized. In addition to supplying information needed by local school boards, the system supplies information needed by state legislatures and Congress concerning actual costs of aided programs. (HW)",

Written reports were generally sent four times yearly. All of the teachers reported having parent conferences; a few reported home visits to all pupils. The teacher questionnaire indicated the following: regular report cards are concise, simple to use, and time saving, but are not  applicable to special classes and are subject to misunderstanding; special report cards share all the advantages of the regular report and none of its disadvantages; narrative reports are exact, individualized, and applicable, but are time consuming and provide no continuity; conferences are accurate and of help to the parents, but are time consuming; and home visits provide the teacher with useful information, but lack privacy and frankness.

Six distinct approaches were implemented, including a residential school, a day school, special class programs, a group approach combined with a tutorial program, a supportive teacher for children in regular classes, and recreational therapy for children in regular classes. Areas involved were identification of problem children, the teacher as team member, teacher evaluation and reporting, techniques to be demonstrated, pupil and project evaluations, teacher objectives and purposes, the teacher's  professional role, classroom management, and means of teacher identification of individual problems to determine classroom procedures. The school's philosophy, location and physical plant, and organization (cooperation, coordination, admission and dismissal procedures, and implementation planning) are described. (RK)",

        "description":"As a result of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), instructional content and style were studied in six teachers teaching the concept of photosynthesis. The same BSCS curriculum program was used by all six teachers; all six had some previous BSCS training. The students in the six classes had been selected on the basis of high ability and/or high achievement. Three consecutive class sessions were recorded during the introduction of photosynthesis and analyzed by the topic classification system of Aschner, Gallagher, and others. Significant interteacher variations were found on dimensions on teacher intent and level of conceptualization but not on teacher style. Wide variations were found among emphases on various biological concepts or background materials. It was thus  concluded that using the same curriculum materials does not insure similar instruction.

        "description":"A 2-year project constructed a work study program for educable mentally retarded (EMR) high school students. The first phase developed courses of study, instructional materials, and teaching procedures; the second phase established a functional vocational training program in five high schools with approximately 150 EMR seniors (IQ range 53 to 78, ages 17-8 to 19-2) and had classroom instruction on occupation and work experience (two 60-minute periods per day) which included experimental use of the material developed in the first phase. The evaluation of the program and a followup on graduated pupils were done in the third phase. Of the 150 pupils, 52% were placed in full-time competitive employment, 32% were in training situations and 15% were unemployed when the project ended.  Optimal employment times were early spring and fall. Instructional materials developed were a series of progressively more complicated job application forms, job descriptions of work for EMR's increasing in reading difficulty from third to fifth grade level, short work-orientated study lessons adapted for role playing, and an interest inventory and a commercially produced booklet on human relations both revised to fourth grade reading levels.

From the results of the series, it was concluded that the storage process can be greatly facilitated; that retarded children preponderantly use less efficient strategies; that successful performance was dependent upon the identification  of learning strategies appropriate to the tasks in question; that experimenter-supplied strategies facilitate retention; and that remediation of associative learning is possible.

Since the subjects had normal hearing, a hearing less was simulated by including a low-pass filter and white noise in the circuit for transposing speech signals. The consonant sounds most easily identified at the first test session were /g/, /k/, /sp/ and /sk/, with /d/ and /c/ the most difficult. The subjects learned to rely in their discriminations on the code dimensions voicing, duration, and cluster consonant but not on place of  articulation. Neither of the two training methods compared, anticipation and recall for paired associate learning, was found more effective.

        "description":"In order to determine the differential ability of mildly retarded school children to profit from coaching on non-verbal, non-academic reasoning problems and to study their problem solving and conceptual behavior, the Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices Test was given to 72 educable students (IQ 55 to 80) in socioeconomically homogeneous suburban slow learner classes (age 6 to 19). Control groups included 36 noncoached subjects and 21 coached and 19 noncoached normals (IQ 95 to 105). Encouragement was given during three test sessions after a coaching session on similar problems; controls were exposed to practice materials without coaching. Interaction of coaching with mental age helped to produce gains in the experimental group, who gained more and faster than the noncoached, with  the first gain being the greatest. Significant gains (p=.05) were recorded for age groups 8 to 9, 12 to 13, and 14 to 15, and were on coaching for the designs where the strong lines were oblique. The conclusion was that mild retardates think like normals but are unable to keep pace after age 12 to 13, particularly in analogical reasoning (corresponding with Piagetian distinctions between concrete and formal thought operations, appearing at age 12). Nongainers had significantly greater physical, emotional, and cultural pathology (p=.05) than gainers. (Author/SN)",

Three factor analyses were conducted of lipreading variables and cognitive abilities in order to verify or refute the hypotheses. The influence of age and/or education on factor structure was also examined. Three samples of hearing lipreaders were used in the investigation: 89 eighth graders, 60 eleventh graders, and 102 adult females. The factoral analyses isolated seven lipreading factors: general lipreading ability, word-phrase lipreading ability, lipreading reasoning, facility with language, word facility, figural word fluency, spatial detail. Important cognitive abilities in  lipreading are fluency and perceptual abilities. Reasoning and flexibility abilities, although of lesser importance than fluency and flexibility abilities, were also found to be important in lipreading. The findings have implications for lipreading teaching. It is suggested that this study has demonstrated the value of factor analysis in the study of lipreading and it is recommended that further factor analytic investigations of lipreading be undertaken.

Each group of 20 subjects completed a modified cloze task. When performances were compared as functions of position of deleted words, sentence types, and grammatical form class of deleted words, results gave a significantly lower mean percent of grammatically meaningful responses for retarded groups (p<.01). All groups performed best when the last word of the four-word sentences were deleted, and the retarded subjects' performance was relatively better than that of matched normal subjects. It was concluded that sequential strategies in processing  sentences are probably more characteristic of retarded children than grammatical strategies. Form class was a significant variable (p<.01), and a significant interaction (p<.01) was found between form class and groups with the EMR children from the public school lower than the CA normal group on all form classes (p<.01) and lower than the MA normal group on verbs (P .05) and adjectives (P .01) but not nouns. Of the two retarded groups, the institutionalized mean was significantly lower (p .01), probably because of a more depressed language environment. (Author/SN)",

Air thresholds obtained by an audiometer were extinguished during the block for  the totally deaf, shifted five decibels for the control deaf, and remained identical in the normal subjects; bone thresholds shifted five decibels for the totally deaf (the bone oscillator went through the whole cranium and thus was not stopped by the local anesthesia), and remained identical for the control subjects.

        "description":"Group conferences, individual study groups, personal visitations, and communication by the principal investigator were utilized to determine the availability and suitability of services for emotionally disturbed children in the four-state area o f Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada which has a low incidence of population in vast territorial areas. The study indicated that services were minimal and that the population included a large portion of children from a culturally different background and heritage. Difficulties in travel and communication and limited financial resources were also noted. Conclusions were that a committee be formed to continue the present study for 3 years and that an action-oriented approach for recruiting and training personnel be implemented. This  program should be similar to the duo-specialist project of Arizona in which teachers from rural areas are selected by local and university people as trainees and study in two or four areas of speciality (guidance, reading, special education, and library) most needed by their local system. Intern teachers, selected by the university, replace the teacher trainees. The 41 duo-specialists (trainees) trained in the first 4 years returned to 38 schools in 75% of the state and performed 72 special services not previously available, while 40 interns have been certified and placed in 10 western states.

Problem definitions obtained numbered 1,172; a 10% random sample of 117 problems was sorted and categorized by 85 special education teachers and graduate students. First order categorized revealed 30 latent categories, and second order clustering reduced the number to 16: aggressive disrupting behavior (18%), deficits in instructional programing (17%), motivation of pupils (14%), inappropriate  affective reactions (7%), hyperactivity and nervousness (7%), reactions to failure (6%), negative home environment (6%), poor personal hygiene (4%), pupil dissatisfaction with being in special classes (4%), perceptual inadequacies (2.5%), truancy (2.5%), emerging sex interests (2.5%), lack of teacher-pupil communication (2.5%), asocial behavior in multiply handicapped (2.5%), overdependency (2.5%), and overimaginative and distorted accounts (2%).

Classes of primary and intermediate slow-learning children and kindergarten children tried out self-motivating materials. Film loops, overhead projection transparencies, light table transparencies, filmstrips, 2x2 slides, and visual puzzles were the means of the learning experience. Generally, a great deal of interest and discussion was provoked by the materials. A demonstration conference in Harrisburg (March 1966) planned basic, educational, personality, and special  education research on these instructional media. It was concluded that educational experiences can be designed and materials produced which enable children to discover things for themselves and learn more actively.

In addition, data obtained allowed for evaluation of two theoretical models of pretest sensitization, the first in terms of learner involvement and the second in terms of pretest position. A total of 1,324 subjects received from one to five repeated measurements of the three variables, achievement, attitude toward the course, and attitude toward psychology. Curves were fitted to each variable over time. The resulting regression equations were compared as functions describing the variables under study. Partial correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between attitude scores and  the final achievement score. Curves were fitted to high, medium, and low groups of each initial test distribution to assess pretest sensitization as a function of initial test distribution, while data on the three different variables was considered to represent three levels of involvement. Increase in achievement was best described by third and fourth degree equations. Attitude toward psychology did not change appreciably over the course of instruction. Attitude toward the course consistently declined. There was no evidence for either model of pretest sensitization. (LS)",

Five studies were conducted to explore these relationships. Knowledge structure was defined as the iconic representation of the body of knowledge in question, learner structure as those stable response tendencies predictive of learner behavior, and message structure as the temporal order in which elements within iconic structures are presented to learners. Graduate education students were asked to respond to a range of iconic knowledge structures. Judgments, problem-solving, and verbal learning were explored. The distribution of response frequencies suggested that learning can  be facilitated or retarded according to the structure of the message and that different types of learning may call for different types of message structure. Findings on the role of individual differences were inconclusive. Preferred temporal order of message elements in an iconic knowledge structure was found to be dependent on the kind of structure in question rather than on the content of the message.

Accumulated research evidence applies to a generalized \"average student,\" and thus to no one. There has been little concern for individual differences in interaction with instructional-media variables. The problem lies with the design of experiments. In the animal lab, treatment averages are meaningful since deviations from the average are small and background variables are constant. In the case of a heterogeneous group, however, random division maintains heterogeneity, and treatment averages are therefore meaningless. Some improvement is brought to the situation if individuals are first separated into aptitude subgroups. Two major questions should be considered: 1) What  aptitude variables are particularly relevant for filmed and/or televised instruction? and 2) What media attributes under what task requirements are particularly likely to interact with aptitudes? Past research has pitted one instructional medium against another without concern for differing individual responses to those media. An alternative approach would consider aptitude interactions with media variables, thus pointing up appropriate treatments for different kinds of students. (LS)",

The results of the earlier study had indicated that shifting from one form or \"code\" of expression to another inhibits a student's ability to express a concept explaining a physical change (cause-effect relationship) but does not inhibit his description of that change. Three sets of demonstrations were developed and were presented on three different days to 289 advanced fourth graders from 12 schools. Each class was divided randomly into four treatment groups. Subjects watched a demonstration and then wrote or drew their answers to the questions, \"What happened?\" and \"Why?\" The same demonstration was repeated a second  time with slightly different materials. Shifting expression groups (S) either drew first and wrote second or the reverse. Repeating expression groups (R) wrote or drew both times. Both the mean R-S difference score and a regression analysis, which treated each subject's score as a separate entity, favor repetition over shifting for correct concept expression. Since all subjects were fourth graders, it is possible that the phenomena noted are developmental and therefore would be absent in older or younger subjects. Appended are the descriptions of the materials and instructions, and the tables developed in the analyses. (LS)",

A total of 196 color slides was accompanied by commentary on magnetic tape, and each student was supplied with a kit of support materials, including programed instruction and self-evaluation exercises. The course was found  suitable for use in the work area and was then self-administered by groups of from one to twenty individuals. Instructional time averaged about six hours, but the total time involved depended on speed of preparation and the number of sessions used to study the nine modules. Comparison of initial and final test scores indicated a significant transference of the desired skills. Management personnel and most of the students expressed satisfaction with the structure, content, and effectiveness of the course. (RM)",

Yet instruction in this skill is rarely available. An independent learning approach based on tachistoscopic speed reading techniques (i.e. controlled exposure) was evaluated for reducing sight reading errors among college piano students. Experimental subjects took part on eight 30 minute sessions over a period of two weeks. During each session, six scores of varying styles were projected onto a rear screen unit by a remote controlled 35mm slide projector. Scores were arranged in order of increasing difficulty. Control subjects received no formal instruction in sight reading during this time period. The performances of experimental  and control subjects were evaluated before and after the sessions by two judges, one judge grading the experimental subjects and the other judge grading the control subjects. Experimental subjects showed a significant decrease in note and meter errors as well as an increase in ability to play with expression. In addition, student attitudes toward the approach were favorable. (RM)",

The study surveys five aspects of tele-communication beginning with the advantages and utility of television in education. Tele-communication systems such as the standard radio frequency and video distribution systems, microwave distribution systems, 2500 megacycle television, and dial access systems are discussed. Alternatives such as audio learning laboratories, telelectures, films, various still  projection techniques, and audio-visual-tutorial systems are considered. Some problems in planning and implementing a system are detailed, and approaches to solving them are proposed. Finally, the types of available research data and some of the potentials for future tele-communication use are surveyed.

Programed learning materials of the University of Illinois Committee on School Mathematics (UICSM) were varied as to covert and overt trial sequences, use of teachers, type of prior practice, order of frames, and size of step. Learning time was not significantly different when sequences of overt and covert trials were varied. When teachers lectured before or after students used programed materials, no significant difference in performance was found between the two conditions. Type of prior practice was varied three ways: stimulus-practice, mediator-practice, and response-practice, all of which were equal in their effect on performance. The  order of appearance of items in a program was found to make no difference in learning. In a final study comparing large and small steps, the large step program was devised by omitting non-essential frames from the original program. A t-test indicated a significant saving of time for subjects using large step materials. It was concluded that studies which further investigate these variables should be based on larger samples.

        "description":"Education is in the midst of a modernizing revolution, and standard texts and old-fashioned teachers are no longer adequate as the sole sources of information. Modern teachers must be constantly trained and retrained; educational television (ETV) not only enables them to learn with their pupils, but also provides them and the increasing numbers of auxiliary teacher aides with in-service training. Today, about two-thirds of the nation's students are covered by ETV which is helping to overcome the lag in education by bringing specialists to the classroom and by using a multisensory approach to learning. Although studies indicate that ETV has been used with greater success in elementary schools, lack of effective use at higher levels is probably a reflection of teacher attitudes.  Since the needs of school districts vary, the same programs may be used in several ways. Many programs may be regional in nature, such as those about local history and geography, while others will be of a more general nature and therefore require avenues of wider distribution. In using ETV, the schools must understand the community's educational expectations. Administration should be through state ETV commissions which are able to represent the needs of elementary schools, high schools, colleges, and the community at large. (CG)",

Such networks aid the industry of a state and provide inservice training, administrative discourse, and educational and cultural opportunities. The National Defense Education Act (1958, Title VII) initiated federal support for research to measure the effectiveness of television as an instructional medium for training of ETV personnel. The Educational Television Facilities Act (1962), Higher Education Act (1965), and Elementary and Secondary Education Act  (1965) supplied federal funds to ETV stations for programing. Today 124 educational television stations broadcast noncommercial programs in 38 states. Federal money supports state and local ETV programs designed to improve professional training and media techniques. The interdependence of ETV and computer facilities promises electronic backbone systems in statewide communications. (TI)",

Students completed attitude questionnaires after each unit that helped decide sequential revisions for the spring, and lab quizzes that denied correlation between achievement and time spent in the laboratory.

While 88% of fall students approved of this approach to laboratory instruction, units were  subdivided and further coordinated with lectures for the spring. Among many conclusions were these: sequences reached pre-stated objectives for non-science majors; a laboratory station can serve at least 16-18 students during a 40-hour week; time for sequence completion varies, and new objectives may be added to such a course.

Six sequences averaging 30 minutes in length and covering topics on art history, artistic techniques, and picture subject matter were developed. The materials for each sequence included a programed booklet with branching format and from 15 to 30 full-sized reproductions. Two of the sequences were subjected to a series of evaluations in several schools. Students were divided into experimental groups and control groups that were uninstructed.  All groups received a pre- and posttest designed to measure improvement. An attitude questionnaire was administered to students and teachers. Both programed sequences showed significant improvement at the .01 level for all experimental groups, with two showing improvement at the .001 level. Material was most effective when used at the instructional level for which it was designed. This method is successful, makes efficient use of resources, is approved by teachers and students, and can achieve objectives with large groups, whether or not the teacher has art teaching experience.

Almost all institutions which have adopted policies assign ownership to the university. Faculty rights have four major aspects: autonomy, internal re-use, external distribution, and revision and withdrawal. Almost all policy statements indicate that the instructor is responsible for the structure and the content of the recordings. A few have specific provisions for re-use,  though a majority require the instructor to sign a release for external use prior to production, and many also require department approval when the recording is to be made available for distribution. The occasion for revision is usually determined by the instructor and/or the department. Faculty compensation is quite varied across the institutions surveyed. Outside persons participating in the recording are usually paid some type of flat fee. Nearly all policies contain provisions for an administrative and review body.

Although there was a statistically significant gain in mean scores for all groups, experimental and control, from pre- to posttesting on the achievement instrument, the statistical data does not support a single definitive statement that one method of teaching is clearly superior to the other. In evaluating the programed method and materials, students noted lack of variety and need for textbook support. Ninth graders were more positive toward the programed course than  tenth, a reversal of the first year experience. Teachers felt that the programed course was academically sound, but lacking in the level of difficulty or scope of a conventional course, and that such materials should be available to teachers throughout the country for use with conventional complements. It is recommended that programed materials be used to strengthen advanced curricula and to teach students with a record of absence.

Teaching machines presented the algebra program to be used at the student's own rate.

        "description":"Video recordings provide an authentic feedback of classroom interaction, and microteaching a systematic method for analysis of these tapes and the acquisition of special teaching skills. Their combined use in teacher education has resulted in improved teacher-classroom interaction at the college level. The development of individual and group models motivates self-improvement in teaching strategy. Often, the psychological impact of self-confrontation causes a beneficial classroom behavioral change. Participatory attitudes, feedback mechanisms, and the feasibility of taping with portable equipment were examined in phase one of this study. In the second phase, tapes of engineering courses were analyzed. Senior and junior faculty members submitted to a minimum of six tapings during a  semester with semi-professional equipment. Problems were encountered in the deployment of taping units and general logistics. Recommendations are that to reduce faculty anxiety, no administrative use should be made of the tapes without consent; that use of one-inch tape should be continued; and that taping and teaching activities should be coordinated. A list of equipment and a taping schedule are included. (TI)",

        "description":"At a two-day meeting sponsored by the National Center for School and College Television and by the American Psychological Association, 15 specialists viewed and reacted to recorded television materials currently used in psychology instruction. Most of the television programs were designed to be courses in Introductory Psychology, and most of the reactions to these were negative. The conferees agreed that \"the great talking fact\" was overdone; that there was not likely to be any advantage to a recorded series of lectures and demonstrations over a live series of the same sessions. Programs were at their best, they agreed, when they presented actual research in progress or involved interactions between people. Interviews were considered most successful when the personality  interviewed was both well-known and articulate. It was strongly felt that televised sessions should be shortened from 45-50 minutes to 15-30 minutes. The potential of television materials was recognized for institutional closed-circuit teacher training, for dramatization of small group phenomena in clinical and social psychology, and for recording of significant symposia. A list is given of television programs and courses considered. (MF)",

        "description":"Formal instruction in music today is primarily conducted in tonal idioms, although contemporary music tends to be atonal in nature. One of the reasons commonly given is that if fundamental instruction were given in atonal idiom only, the students would be handicapped in understanding serious music which is tonal in nature. To test the argument that atonal instruction will transfer to tonal idioms, a laboratory study was conducted. It examined the following issues. Will progress in the aural and visual perception of music through instruction based upon atonal organization transfer to progress in the aural and visual perception of tonal music? Will students of different levels of ability show similar attainment in the aural and visual perception of music under conditions of  selected responses and constructed responses? Will students of different levels of musical ability respond with similar attitudes toward tape? Findings implied that musical instruction in atonal idioms is not detrimental to students, even with respect to tonal idioms. It also appeared that progress can be better measured when pure perception of intervals and melodies is not the crucial issue, and that tape-recorded self-instruction is an acceptable educational method both for high achieving and low achieving students.

        "description":"Title III , unique among higher education enactments in emphasizing the developing rather than the prestigious or populous institution, attempts to identify colleges having a potential for making substantial educational contributions. It calls for a partnership between the federal government and the developing colleges by supporting cooperative programs that link culturally different regions of the country and by fostering a national system of higher education. If the program were imaginatively administered and supplied with greatly increased federal support, a dramatic payoff would be possible. The history of the growth of interinstitutional cooperation, the movement to strengthen Negro colleges, the expansion of federal funding, and the development of Title III legislation,  illustrate the program's main purpose, to generate social change. Because additional information is needed to guide federal decisions, application forms should be revised to include data on the established and developing college's social and academic contribution to its students, faculty, administrators and community, on how the program can be continued beyond the grant's term, and on the influences of the college's regional environment. Underadministered at present, the program needs aggressive leaders to help accelerate the movement toward more univeral higher education, the achievement of greater educational opportunity, the experiencing by students of a higher quality of learning, and toward focusing higher education upon relevant problems plaguing society.

Grades in specific courses as well as overall grade point averages were studied. The ACT and SAT tests exhibited about the same degree of predictive validity, and both were better predictors than the SCAT. Predictive results varied from school to school and from course subject to course subject, thereby suggesting that predictive validity for individual colleges and universities and for specific subject matter areas should be established. In addition, a college's choice between the ACT or  SAT probably cannot be made on the basis of their relative predictive validities, but rather should be made on the basis of the total programs of services offered by the respective testing agencies.

Forty-six studies concerned with this relationship were reviewed. The studies were divided into 8 categories--business, teaching, engineering, medicine, scientific research, miscellaneous occupations, studies of successful individuals, and non-vocational accomplishments. Although this area of research is plagued by many theoretical, experimental, measurement, and statistical difficulties, evidence strongly suggests that college grades bear little or no relationship to any measures of adult accomplishment. The findings indicate that 3 major changes in evaluation and selection procedures are urgently needed. First, the  meaning of grades should be empirically determined. Second, evaluation procedures in higher education should be drastically altered. Third, these changes should be reflected in policies of selection or acceptance for professional training.

In an effort to devise an instructional method for teaching score reading skill, self instructional programed drill materials were developed and the use of these materials in improving the score reading skill of student conductors was evaluated. Music material for the drill tapes was randomly gathered from public school performances. Analyses of these performances resulted in a glossary of typical student errors. Short excerpts were re-recorded in which only one pitch or rhythm error was allowed in an otherwise near perfect performance. Errors were programmed so that detection and identification  were accomplished in four frames. Twenty tapes of 12 excerpts each were developed. Similar non-programed materials were constructed for purposes of comparison. The result of the experimental application of these drills indicated that the programed materials produce greater improvement in score reading skill than non-programed materials. (Author/AM)",

To test this hypothesis, questionnaires containing 8 items requiring self-ratings and 8 items describing desirable accomplishments, aspirations or goals were administered in 1964 and again in identical form in 1965 to students at ten colleges and universities. Eleven of the items were selected for further study. Students reported their extracurricular achievements during college in a variety of areas such as science, leadership and art. Changes on each goal or self-rating were related to the level of accomplishment on one or more achievement scales, presumably related to the goals. The research supported the  hypothesis. For example, changes in self-ratings of popularity and in the goal of prominence in public affairs were positively related to achievement in such relevant areas as leadership and participation in social activities. The findings also indicated that changes in self-ratings and life goals were re\"ated to the characteristics of the colleges the students were attending. (Author/AM)",

To examine the way the University of Illinois is meeting these responsibilities, a study was made of the structural approach to extension and public service, the personnel and finances involved, the clientele served, the methods and techniques employed, and the specific programs undertaken. The  results indicated that the university was heavily but haphazardly involved, that the character of the clientele varied greatly, and that so many different techniques were used that no conclusion could be drawn as to which were most effective. An examination was also made of the specific external problems needing attention and the institutional adjustments, in terms of organization, personnel and finance, that would have to be faced in order to meet society's demands and needs.

Other papers dealt with the responsibilities of state music supervisors, the changing patterns and concepts of certification, and the effect of mass media on culture. Reports on Title I and Title III ESEA music projects were given. Discussions were held on (1) the manner in which changing philosophies of state departments of education affect the responsibilities of their personnel, (2) the increasing attention being  paid to required secondary school music, and (3) the advancement of computer science technology over the musician's present ability to use it efficiently. All of these factors are related to the dichotomy between the creative artist and the teacher, the need for more state education department music personnel, and the trend toward having music taught by specialists.

        "description":"To better understand the medical internship, a required and critical part of the educational preparation of young physicians, and its relevance for their future careers, the experience of interns on the Harvard Medical Service at the Boston City Hospital was documented. The principal method used to gather information was participation in and observation of the daily activities of an internship, in the clinics, wards, meetings and lectures. During the 18-month investigation, hypotheses were formulated and tested by further observation and direct questioning. To compare the experience of Harvard interns with the internship program at another hospital, 3 months were spent as a participant/observer at a community hospital. An objective test, a questionnaire and the National Board of  Medical Examiners examination were also evaluated. Although most interns aspired to careers in teaching or research, they and advisors agree that a straight medical internship should be served, preferably at a university-affiliated hospital. There, because of heavy demands, their work consists almost entirely of attending patients. To reconcile directing their efforts toward patient care rather than formal academic learning, interns justify their work as an educationally beneficial clinical experience. They thus reduce the conflict between their own academic desires and the hospital's purpose. &quot;Learning the ropes&quot; is a crucial factor in an intern's success. Although the work of the internship at the university and the community hospital was similar, the programs differed because of  conditions and objectives. (JS)",

Based on the belief that college art education offers numerous opportunities for utilizing original thinking, developing skills and cultivating aesthetic sensitivities, this study investigated the effect of various inner-directed and outer-directed motivation and evaluation strategies upon the visual art work of non-art students. Visual and non-visual stimuli were used to produce drawings in and out of class. Forty-four subjects were assigned to 4 groups, Teacher Motivation-Teacher Evaluation; Teacher  Motivation-Student Evaluation; Student Motivation-Teacher Evaluation; Student Motivation-Student Evaluation. The major conclusions are that \"(1) in terms of the environmental conditions and the criterion variables, significantly different scores are shown among the experimental groups, (2) in terms of the environmental conditions and the criterion variables, significantly different scores are shown among the experimental groups for specific periods of instruction, and (3) a significant difference is not found to exist between the four experimental treatments and the two levels of stimuli.\" (JS)",

        "description":"In order to compile information to be used as a basis for developing a curriculum for teaching glass as an art material on the college level, glass experts, artists and centers in 12 nations were visited. It was clear that the US lags far behind other countries in teaching glass, in using it as a subject for art exhibitions and using it creatively in architecture, sculpture and painting. Not only is the neglect of this medium unfortunate because of artistic needs but also because there are few skilled American technicians to preserve or enhance this area of endeavor. Although glass is prized for the permanence of its color and transparency, there have been obstacles to its widespread use. These could be overcome and educational needs could be met if federal, foundation and  industrial support could be made available for (1) the establishment of a free national glass experimental and informational center (2) the collection of teaching materials (3) teaching labs for glass artists and (4) international exhibitions on glass art. Federal aid should be channeled either through a new university or through universities in the Southwestern area to take advantage of existing native cottage-industry efforts. A model curriculum is presented, and a 5-year federally supported program is recommended (effective 1968) for a complete summer school of glass in Murano, Italy where artists, teachers and architects can be trained quickly and economically.

This is an attempt to capture current usage, bur not necessarily to fix either the terminology or the phenomenon described. It is a definition of terms, not a manual of procedures, although precise definition should  help to clarify procedures. The material was put together during a week-long seminar held in Washington, D.C. in October 1966.

To guide the investigation, a number of questions were put forth relating to whether teachers tend to prejudge students on the basis of compatibility with their personal values. Conducted at the State University of NY at Buffalo, questionnaires were administered to 792 students pursuing a preparatory program to teach on the elementary and secondary level and 26 of their teachers. Rokeach's Dogmatism Scale and an adaptation of the life goals from Getzels and Jackson were used. At mid-semester,  faculty also completed another questionnaire asking them to rank their students as above average, average, or below average without reference to grade books or other sources. The findings were first that open and closed minded students taught by open and closed minded teachers did not receive a significantly different grade distribution. Second, students who shared the same goals as their teachers received about the same distribution of grades as those whose goals differed. Third, when beliefs AND goals correspond, grades tended to show a certain pattern. Grade discrimination only seems to appear when beliefs and goals are considered together. Class ranking did not seem to be influenced by mutual agreement on goals. Evidence indicated that class participation may be a deciding factor  affecting faculty evaluation of students. (JS)",

Before entering college, each of the 368 subjects was asked what level of education he intended to achieve. From questionnaires completed in summer 1964 it was found that 6% of males and 7% of females had not obtained a bachelor's, 13% of males and 25% of females had completed their bachelor's but had not attempted graduate study, 72% of males had a master's or were still pursuing graduate study, and 10% of males had obtained a doctoral or professional degree. Among women, 68% had completed some graduate work. While scores on  precollege scholastic ability exams did not affect educational progress, higher annual income and level of education attained by fathers plus a greater emphasis on education and learning in the home were factors contributing to a higher level of education among male students. Among females, the same held true except that scholars from wealthier families were making the least progress. Jewish males and Catholic or Jewish females appeared more likely to have progressed to the graduate level. Personality factors determined by the CPI showed five scales to differentiate significantly among the male progress groups and five differentiated among the female groups. (CS)",

These same scholars submitted information concerning their career plans or choices in the Summer of 1965. The most popular initial choices among men were the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering. Among women, the physical sciences, mathematics and education were most often chosen. From the data collected in 1965, it was evident that a considerable change in career objectives occurred in both sexes. Among men, engineering suffered the  greatest loss of talent to other career fields. Medicine, law and the biological sciences were the only fields keeping at least 50 percent of their initial recruits.

Although there has been a virtual revolution in the development of new techniques of instruction at the university level in recent years, there has been a lack of constructive discussion about graduate-professional teaching. Related to innovative educational experiments, the current student rebellion against all kinds of establishments and their involvement in radical social movements imply an urgent need for total academic restructuring. Two current student trends relate directly to the purposes of theological education - the demand to redefine the educational process as guided self-discovery, and the concern  to extend the campus to include its total environment. For the project, a selected number of experimental teaching programs in various kinds of schools and research centers were evaluated. The form of this prospectus consists of a series of theses followed by a random sampling of the kinds of sources which seem relevant. It is contemplated that a full report with recommendations would issue from this research. It seems inevitable that seminaries and divinity schools will require radical restructuring. (Author/JS)",

The 3 groups all gave low rankings to research-related criteria and criteria concerned with off-campus community relations. The criterion of &quot;making appearances which assist programs of community organization&quot; was ranked as LEAST important. When criteria used in the  faculty merit rating was compared to criteria used in the questionnaire, it was found that 4 criteria ranked in the top 10 in the survey do not appear in the Merit Rating Form, whereas 4 listed in the bottom 10 of the survey do, suggesting that the Form should be redesigned. The same pattern of discrepancy and implied need for change was evident when the questionnaire was compared with the University's most widely used student evaluation form. Patterns of rankings suggest that teaching faculty are being evaluated according to a different scale by administrative faculty. Rankings by subgroups of faculty, student and alumni indicate interesting divergencies.

Despite large sums and percentage increases, however, public higher education is not receiving the support it needs to keep up with rising costs and demands. Enrollments, in particular, will probably double in 1970-80 as they have in 1960-70. Since 70% of 1968 enrollments are in public universities, the public sector will bear the brunt of further increases. To explore the effect of financial shortages, a survey of the 100 members of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges was conducted. Throughout the 61 responses rang the warning that it will become ever harder for institutions to catch up and  compensate for years of reduction, delay and neglect. The major reasons cited for growing budget requests were expansion, inflation and salaries. A majority of institutions also listed needs for new programs, projects and facilities. Survey institutions said that inadequate financing threatens quality and opportunity, and because of enrollment growth and expansion, the lack of capital for facilities is a critical problem. Every institution reported that their state appropriation was less than the university request. But if states update their revenue systems, it is within their capacity to provide the funds necessary for economic growth and for a wise and humane citizenship. (JS)",

The lecture-laboratory method comprised one hour of lecture and demonstration and one hour of laboratory work, during which the students solved problems with individual help from the instructor. To test the assumption that the laboratory method would be superior, an experiment was set up for 171 students in two groups. The equality of the two groups was determined by the Cooperative Mathematics Pre-test for College Students and the final examination was considered valid for deciding which method was better.  Provision was made for control of three variables, namely, differences (1) in ability between day and night students, (2) in initial ability of the groups, and (3) caused by improved teaching. Seven day and six night classes were tested in such a way that a fall and a spring semester were taught by each method. The same instructor taught one group of 94 by the lecture method and another group of 77 by the lecture-laboratory method. The first group had a final examination score of 62.0; the latter group had a final score of 70.1.

Two papers discuss the scope and development of a speech course. Five papers examine the requirements of the library as a multi-media center, housing not only books but also films, records, tapes, etc. and point out that the library must make allowance for increased automation of its services. These papers redefine both the library's and librarian's functions and cover the planning, philosophically and architecturally, of a learning center, faculty attitudes and involvement, and the ideal and efficient use of a resource center. Two papers discuss the college board; one tells how to achieve a good relationship between the board and the  president; the other describes in detail the structure of a junior college board in Illinois. Another speech gives an example of how to organize work-study programs in cooperation with industry, and still another looks at the president in the roles of consultant and delegator. The final paper addresses the conference on the community college mission in a time of special revolution. (HH)",

The P's indicated that they planned to join science clubs and take part in projects, that they liked the special curriculum of the University and its progressive outlook, that they were attracted by its  fraternities, sororities, and good athletic program; they were also less likely to be engaged or dating seriously. The W's tended to choose careers unrelated to the University's available majors and showed considerable interest in music, debating, acting, and other intramural activities. The D's planned to engage in more athletic programs and other intramurals and were more likely to be engaged or dating seriously. At present these non-intellective factors can be used in only a limited way to assist in prediction, but the student personnel staff shoudl be aware of them and conduct further investigation. (HH)",

Divided into groups of 40 each, the students were assigned to one of three conditions of counseling and testing: (1) non-reinforcement counseling (Group A), in which the counselor assumed a laissez faire role, (2) reinforcement (Group B), in which the counselor verbally reinforced student responses, and (3) control group (Group C) which took the pretest and posttest. Students in  groups A and B were encouraged to interact verbally with respect to their test profiles. Each student, using the Ryan Personal Inventory test, rated himself on a 5-point scale. The values were chi-squared for ten interest areas; social service, outdoor, mechanical, clerical, computational, persuasive, scientific, artistic, literary, and musical. No significant change was detected in certain student interests at P .05 level.

He therefore compared the achievement, after one semester, of transfer students from the junior college, the state college, and the private 4-year liberal arts college to the state university, without regard to the achievement of native students. A random sample was drawn of 50 students from each source. If significant differences were found, they would have implications for curriculum planning and instruction at the sending institution. The university Admissions Office supplied the GPA at the end of each subject's first term. (These were not all for the  same term, as the students began at different times.) Separate computations were made to test the significant differences, if any, in comparisons of (1) private with state college transfers, (2) private with junior college transfers, and (3) state college with junior college transfers. Although results showed that there were no statistically significant differences in success of transfers from the three types of institution at the end of their first semester, they did suggest that the junior college transfers are closer to academic difficulty than the other two groups and that the state college transfer students make a slightly better adjustment to the new academic pressure than the others.

The hypotheses--that there are no differences between dismissed, retained, or good standing probationary students on these six variables--were rejected at the .05 level or less: (1) HSR--for total group, but not for males or females; (2) SCAT-T--for males, females, and total grouping; (3) class load--for females only, not for males or total; (4) age--for all three groupings; (5) attendance--for all  groupings; and (6) sex--for males and females, but not for total. The successful (good standing) probationary student is about a year older than his or her classmates, attends class regularly, and has an HSR in at least the 22nd percentile. Females will have a SCAT-T score of 54 and limit their class load to nine hours. Males will have a SCAT-T score of 57 and will take only enough classes to exempt them from the draft. The remedial program is relatively ineffective for the younger students. , especially males, just our of high school, with an HSR in the lowest 20%. Also, males with a SCAT-T raw score at or below 52 and females with a score at or below 46 have little chance of success. (HH)",

Findings included (1) a  significant difference in GAP in the College of Education for both semesters and in Arts and Science for the first semester, but in Business and Public Administration for neither semester, (2) the GPA of the rural transfers equalled that of the natives, (3) those from private colleges had lower GPA's for both semesters, and (4) those from urban colleges had lower GPA's for the first semester but equalled the natives in the second term. Private school transfers had more difficulty than those from rural or urban colleges. The cause of this transition problem appears to deserve study.

Stern's Activities Index and Stern and Pace's College Characteristics Index were used to assess needs and perceived environmental press of the two groups in the sample. The hypotheses tested were that there was no significant difference. The junior college academic climate was seen as providing less encouragement for leadership and self-assurance, and less exposure to diversity of experience, such as faculty, public discussion, and innovation. On the non-academic scale, the university was  considered more collegiate than the junior college because of its extra-curricular activities, group spirit, and the like. Both groups had generally comparable personalities. The junior college man, however, was more objective toward life and preferred less self-indulgent experiences, while, conversely, the university student preferred sensory self-gratification and involvement in the typically collegiate atmosphere. The results of the study suggested increased student personnel services at the junior college to provide more chance for personal and social development. Although vocational aspirations require quite different academic preparation, the personality needs of the two groups require a similar social background. (HH)",

When an admission policy is altered at the freshman level, it soon affects the transfer and his chance of success must be re-evaluated. Adequate counseling by the senior colleges should prevent a student from being admitted to an institution where he has little chance of success. This prospect of failure might be due to exacting upper-division requirements or to unsuitable preparation at certain junior colleges. To evaluate first-semester success of transfers from four different colleges, to see if there is a significant difference between GPA's earned at the different colleges and in the first semester after transfer, and to see if  the 2.00 GPA requirement is realistic for transfers, three null hypotheses were tested: that there is no significant difference in (1) GPA in junior college and in first semester after transfer, (2) GPA's earned at the four different colleges, and (3) mean GPA drop in first semester among transfers from the four colleges. &quot;T&quot; values were computed for the various correlations. Hypotheses one and three were rejected; hypothesis two was accepted. From the findings, it seems likely that the required 2.00 average may not be realistically high enough for transfers from certain Missouri junior colleges and that there is a possible need for diversity in admissions policies for transfers from certain colleges.

In the first part, they listed age, present occupation, parents' occupation, job goals, future plans, and marital status. (GPA's were obtained from the registrar.) In section two, on a 5-point scale, they rated 40 items related to college experiences. No significant demographic differences were noted that would help to predict withdrawal. Other findings included: (1) dropouts tended to be older, more were married, and more planned to  continue working, while the continuers wanted only to complete their education; (2) there was a significant difference in the GPA's of the two groups, even though the literature reports that they have the same academic ability; (3) the groups were alike in vocational goals and in parents' education and work status; (4) about the same number were undecided on their future; (5) both groups held generally favorable feelings about teachers and counselors; and (6) the usual reasons for attrition (illness, financial need, marriage, lack of interest, etc.) did not emerge in this report. The author hopes that future studies will help the college to differentiate between those who merely need time off from college and those whose needs are not being met. (HH)",

        "description":"To determine the interpersonal values of college and university students, three hypotheses were tested to see if there was a significant difference among the values of (1) junior college students in a terminal course, (2) those in a transfer course, and (3) university students. The sample comprised 93 Missouri University freshmen, 116 junior college transfer students, and 40 terminal or vocational students. Gordon's Survey of Interpersonal Values was used to measure six qualities: support, conformity, recognition, independence, benevolence, and leadership. On the value of conformity, a significant difference was found between the university students and each of the two samples of college students; on the leadership scale, the university students scored higher than the transfer  students. There were no significant differences in the other correlations. It seemed possible that the junior college students scored higher on conformity because they were more likely to live at home, whereas a university atmosphere usually fosters non-conformity. The lower academic ability of many junior college students also tends to favor conformity. This knowledge should permit administrators a better choice in the extra-curricular activities they encourage. These results also suggested a definite need for leadership training programs at the junior college. Such programs may also be needed at the university, for the fact that the students value leadership highly does not necessarily mean that they have an opportunity to exercise it. (HH)",

        "description":"This paper surveys the trend in junior college organization toward the multi-unit system. It has evolved to meet the needs of both crowded metropolitan areas, where many physical facilities are required, and of extended rural districts, whose small population and tax support require consolidation of administration. Depending on whether authority and supportive services are centralized or decentralized, several forms of operation have developed: (1) a 1-college, branch-centers model, (2) a 1-college, multi-campus model, (3) a multi-campus district model, and (4) a multi-college, district model. A paradigm showing the relationship between these models reveals a continuum of development from centralized to decentralized authority. There is also a positive correlation between the age  of the system and the degree of autonomy in its units. There are overlapping elements in all four models, of course, and systems under university control show still another variation. Problems unique to the multi-unit system are that administrative organization differs from that for a single institution, accreditation must be determined for the whole or for each unit, master planning for physical facilities, faculty, financing, and everyday communication and coordination are all more complex, and the location and extent of educational services must be foreseen with considerable certainty. The writer warns that the multi-unit system can bring either economy and efficiency or chaos and confusion. (HH)",

To design a graduate program, they analyzed the instructors by the education they had or needed. The data came from 450 teachers at 14 of the 16 Kansas junior colleges. Among the findings were: (1) 88% came from elementary or secondary schools, (2) many had limited teaching experience or recently-earned graduate qualifications, (3) most were well qualified in their teaching field, (4) many had had undergraduate education courses, (5) only a third had had a course specifically on the 2-year college, and (6) many held graduate degrees and others had done work beyond the master's. Groups expected in the program were secondary and elementary teachers,  those with graduate degrees but little or no teaching experience or professional course work, and faculty members who, regardless of degree, wished to raise their professional qualifications. Most study in the program should be in the candidate's teaching field, with some education courses to supply background and technique. Field experience should replace the usual student teaching programs. Proposals for the program were: (1) 23 hours of course and thesis work in a major; (2) a seminar conducted by graduate faculty members on student characterists, teaching methods, curriculum, and current issues in higher education; (3) internship to provide junior college teaching experience; and (4) a special course on the junior college.

CAP has worked to attract students, full- or part-time, to technical training. Mechanical Technology and Electronics Advisory Committees set up a work-study program, with industry taking the lead in recruitment and in-plant training. Students are told of the program through the news media and by visits of both college and industry personnel to the high schools. So far, 36 companies have participated, with requests for 186 student-employees; 76 students enrolled in the first CAP group. This paper lists the program's  advantages; career advancement, income while studying, continued education, community enthusiasm, etc. It also points out four main problems and their solutions: (1) the need for good communication between college and company is solved by dealing with a single liaison man at each firm; (2) if a student seeks an unsuitable job, the company puts him in touch with the college for redirection to suitable work or to CAP; (3) high school students are often deficient in mathematics; CAP therefore has its own special counselor; (4) coordination of class and in-plant training schedules is complex, but it can be accomplished by cooperation between company and college personnel.

        "description":"The Library Aides Program, an Elementary and Secondary Education Act project, was begun in 1966 in the Pittsburgh public and parochial schools to provide a trained aide to assist the librarian with general and paraprofessional duties. An evaluation of the public school program was conducted (1) to determine how librarians and library aides divide their time among various duties performed in the library, (2) to determine whether librarians who are assigned library aides devote more of their time to professional duties, and (3) to assess the librarians' attitudes toward the program. Using the questionnaire method and a control group of eight schools not in the program, the evaluation indicated that librarians divide their time approximately equally between professional and  nonprofessional duties, irrespective of the presence or absence of aides. The Library Aides Program was considered successful by all who were involved in it, and no criticism of the program was offered except that the program should be extended to provide for a full-time aide. Appendixes include the evaluation questionnaires and tables displaying the allocation of librarian time. (JB)",

The program was initiated to relieve the librarian of some nonprofessional activities by providing her with a paraprofessional aide. The findings of the 1968 evaluation indicate that the librarians are satisfied with the aides, but there is no statistically significant difference between the amount of professional activities of librarians in program and control schools. An attempt was made to find a significant difference between program and control schools with respect to individuation of student-librarian interaction, but no such difference was found. More specific definition of librarian and aide duties and responsibilities is needed. Although the program has shown some success in  providing librarian satisfaction and possibly in the extension of library services, it has yet to demonstrate effects in services to students. Appendices include the program definition, interview schedules for librarians and library aides, and the observation schedule. (Author/JB)",

The resources available, the needs of various users, and the necessary elements for a viable system, including financial considerations, are assessed.

Findings show that present library resources are inadequate and the financing formula of proposed legislation is not seen as offering a final solution to the problem. Recommendations for establishing a Nassau-Suffolk regional 3 R's program involve: (1) designation of specific libraries to serve as basic reference centers for college students and other researchers with intermediate reference needs, (2)  financial assistance to co-central public libraries to assist them in offering improved service to college students, (3) designation of the library at the State University of New York at Stony Brook as a principal research library resource for a 3 R's regional system, (4) contracts made for an interim period with the appropriate New York City library agencies to provide photocopies of journals or texts, and (5) contracts with the Nassau Library System and Suffolk Cooperative Library System to provide communication, transportation, business and public relations services for the regional 3 R's system.

The processing system would consist of one main computer and cataloging center and six regional processing centers. It is recommended that school libraries coordinate with one of two centralized processing systems currently in advanced stages of design--the State University of New York (SUNY) system for university libraries and the Association of New York Libraries for Technical Services (ANYLTS) system for public libraries instead of  establishing a third computer facility. Two plans, one involving each system, are described in detail with information on costs and implementation schedules included. The plan to coordinate with the SUNY system is favored, although it is suggested that the ANYLTS system could be expanded to adequately meet the school libraries' processing needs. (CC)",

Topics which have been discussed are perception, oral language, concept formation, learning set, motivation, and the psychology of learning. Universities and public school systems working together in longitudinal research studies of teacher-pupil interaction, curriculum effectiveness, and instructional methods will provide information to be built into educational action programs. Since children develop both through maturation and interaction with environmental stimulation, specific instruction for cognitive, language, and perceptual development is presently being given in compensatory preschool programs. Followup-study results from  these programs, as well as from research projects, should be used to revise and improve future instructional schemes. A review of the literature of curriculum development for kindergarten children and a bibliography of early childhood studies are provided. (MS)",

This study repeated the earlier ones modifying procedures of instructions, testing, and schedule of recall. Also, it tested the effect of labeling pictorial stimuli. The sample of 253 children were to learn to discriminate either content or position of presented pictures as central information. The sample was divided by three age groups, 7 to 9, 10 to 11, and 12 to 14. These groups were further subdivided into four groups. The first group received more ambiguous directions than did the other groups. The second group was tested on a balanced schedule of recall. The third group was shown names of animals, while the fourth group  was shown numbers designating positions of pictures. The results showed that (1) as before, content recall scores increase with age, (2) more ambiguous directions led to less selectivity at all ages, (3) a balanced schedule of recall was effective at an older age, (4) labeling depresses incidental information scores at all ages, and (5) name labeling is more effective than numerical labeling, but not at a significant level.

Visual perceptions of children of other cultures were compared to those of children of the dominant Anglo-Saxon culture. The relationship of visual perceptions to cultural deprivation was also studied. The development of children's visual perceptions over a period of 18 to 25 months and the effectiveness of various types of programs in improving a child's visual perceptions were investigated. Results of testing showed that all rural children scored low in form constancy. Culturally deprived  children scored lower in all perceptions, but visual perception handicaps were sometimes as great as eight times that o f control group children. The valus of the Frostig developmental training program was demonstrated. Pupil progress was retained for at least one academi c year. The study concludes that visual perception handicaps result from cultural deprivation rather than from participation in a nondominant culture. Implications are that rural children would benefit from form constancy training during their first year at school. (MS)",

One of the most important aspects of a child's personality development concerns the conceptions he has of himself. It is posited that two important influences upon these conceptions are (1) interpersonal relationships and (2) physical environment. To test these postulates, 39 of the subjects of this study were placed in an experimental class presided over by mothers with no teacher training and with a ratio of one adult to four children. The remaining preschoolers attended a regular Head Start class. It was hypothesized that all subjects would demonstrate greater sensitivity to their own selves at the conclusion of the 6-week summer  program than they had at the beginning and that the children in the experimental class would show a more significant change in accuracy of self-perception than the others because of the low adult-child ratio. A Doll-Self Point task and a Draw-A-Person task were used as pretests and posttests. The results from these tasks supported the first part of the hypothesis and, with reservations, the second part. Although the experimental class group showed significantly greater increases in self-drawing scores, they also had higher pretest scores. (WD)",

In particular, the preschool experience of the lower class child establishes patterns of responsive behavior and ways of relating to the authority structure of the school which are not conducive to academic learning and prevent the child from taking full advantage of the cognitive experiences available. The influence on the child of his mother's attitudes is the subject of this study. Mothers have been grouped into two types for this study: (1) status oriented mothers, who emphasize the difference in status and power between the child and the teacher and offer compliance and docility as techniques for the child to deal with the classroom situation, and (2) the person  oriented mother, who sees less distance between herself and the school and is thus less concerned with obedience and more concerned with cognitive development. The population investigated in this study was urban and rural Negro, white, and Seminole Indian families. Eight predictions were made concerning the effect of the mother's attitude on the child's performance on various cognitive tests. The data analysis is not yet complete.

The study was based on McClelland's theory of achievement motive and the models of Atkinson and Aronson. Children were pretested and posttested with the Aronson and Level of Aspiration Tests. Data concerning teachers was collected on the Observer's Rating Form. Mothers filled in the Winterbottom Questionnaire. Both ethnic groups of children made gains in achievement motive. The total Head Start experience was apparently responsible for the change in subjects towards motive to avoid failure. Head Start reinforcement practices were more structured and systematic  than is common to lower class parents' practices. Type of reinforcement is associated with the development of the achievement motive. Because teacher aides spend much time with the children, a workshop on the nature and effects of reinforcement is recommended as part of any future aide training program. Facsimiles of the Spanish and English questionnaire forms and the rating scale are in the appendixes. (MS)",

During the data gathering, special measures were used to assess the child's curiosity and exploration, self-image, perception  of adults and environment, and concept formation. The results showed that although the subjects were not as advanced as middle class children, they did divide into high and low developed groups. Those subjects with more active exploratory behavior were more coherent, had more positive images, and had a more adequate concept formation.

Experimental group one (X-1) consisted of 105 children who had attended a yearlong Preschool Readiness Center program. Experimental group two (X-2) consisted of 93 children who had attended a summer Head Start program. Control groups one and two (C-1 and C-2) consisted of 79 low income children with no preschool training. Control group three (C-3) consisted of 59 middle income children with no preschool experience. All preschool children were tested upon entry into their particular program by means of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Preschool Inventory, and the California Test of Personality. All children were tested upon entry into the first grade by means of the above three measures plus  the Metropolitan Readiness Test. In May 1968, during the end of their first-grade year, all children were administered the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT). A comparison of these results showed that upon entry into the first grade, group X-1 performed the best of all groups on the four measures, with group C-3 second best. Group C-3 scored significantly better than all other groups on the MAT, group X-1 not performing significantly better than X-2, C-1, and C-2. Thus, group X-1's initial superior performance was not sustained over the first year of school. It was discovered that children whose parents did not participate in the programs demonstrated the poorest test performances. (WD)",

Thirty-six subjects were obtained from grades two through six of local public elementary schools in Nashville, Tennessee. Associations between neutral objects and rewards were formed in a task concerning discrimination learning. Subsequently, measures of the effects of the associations were obtained with respect to verbal evaluation, expectancy of obtaining new rewards, choice behavior, and a variety of aspects of selective attention. In different experiments, parameters of learning, such as magnitude of reward and per cent of reward, were investigated. The hypothesized effects were obtained with respect to the dependent measures. Studies of  selective attention such as eye movements, were made with respect to a wide variety of stimulus variables concerning different aspects of information, such as novelty. With all types of materials, selective attention was found to be a monotonically increasing function of amount of information in the display. (Author/JS)",

In order to obtain such data, 638 kindergarten (P-K) children in Minnesota were tested on three instruments: (1) the Metropolitan Readiness Tests (MRT), (2) the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA), and (3) the Behavior Rating Scale. Some 570 prefirst-grade (P-1) children were also tested, including 300 of the children tested at the P-K level. It was found that P-K girls did significantly better on the MRT than P-K boys, and girls did better than boys at the P-1 level. Compared with norms available for P-1 children, the P-1  boys in this study fell at the thirty-fifth percentile; the girls, at the forty-second. On the ITPA, neither at the P-K level nor at the P-1 level did there exist overall differences in performance on the basis of sex. It appears, therefore, that the kindergarten experience tends to modify initial performance differences on the basis of sex towards uniformity rather than towards greater divergence in favor of the girls. P-K girls rated higher than the boys on all items of the Behavior Rating Scale, but at the P-1 level there was no significant difference. (WD)",

Validity was determined by comparing the examination results with results of the Metropolitan Readiness Test (MRT) and then testing both groups of predictions by examining the actual performance of the children on the criterion measures; that is, the achievement tests. The subjects of this study were 43 first grade Negro children, half of which had participated in a summer Head Start program and all of which represented a population meeting the criteria for funding by the  Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), and 45 Negro first grade children who were from schools not meeting the OEO criteria. Both groups were administered the Neurological Screening Test, the MRT, certain tests from the Stanford Achievement Battery, and various psychological tests. Although the results of this study indicate that the neurological test was not consistently as good a predictor of school performance as the MRT, it did demonstrate it had predictive value. It should be noted that the neurological test takes about 15 minutes to administer while the MRT takes one to two hours. (WD)",

        "description":"Pioneering research has shown that infants are capable of perceptual discrimination and has provided some indication of the nature of the discrimination; that is, what stimuli are differentiable. Studies have demonstrated that significant effects exist, in stimulus-pair comparisons, for age of infant, speed of movement of stimulus during perception, and for the age-speed interaction. The stimulus involved was checkerboard designs. It has been discovered that the looking pattern of infants varies with age. The younger infant takes fewer but longer looks, while the older infant takes more but shorter looks. It has also been found that younger infants are more likely, when finally shifting their gaze, to shift it back to the first stimulus. This factor cuts into the reliability of  using pair-comparisons for measuring infant stimulus preference, especially because trial times are often brief (about 30 seconds). It is possible to measure preference by just presenting one stimulus and recording fixation time. It was discovered that 10-week-old children looked at the most complex of three checkerboard stimuli the most and the least complex stimulus the least. This was also found true of 20-week-old children. Eight-week-old children preferred the medium complexity stimulus. A hypothesis now under investigation is that younger than 8-week-old children will look at the least complex stimulus the most. (WD)",

        "description":"An important approach to understanding child behavior and development is the experimental analysis of such behavior. The experimental analysis procedure must be distinguished from related analyses used occasionally. An analysis by anecdote is an analysis based upon the accumulation of recurring associations; for example, B followed by A. This does not assure the existence of a causative relationship. An analysis by correlation is a survey of two anecdotes, (1) if B, then A, and (2) if no B, then no A. But this analysis does not assure that when factors 1 and 2 exist, some factor 3 exists or that both A and B are controlled by C. The experimental method requires that the experimenter manipulate or control A and B in an arbitrary fashion. This reasonably precludes control by some  unknown C and reasonably illustrates the causative relationship. The age of a child limits the application of the experimental analysis approach; that is, very young children are generally not available for use in a comprehensively controlled environment. The operant behavior procedure does not require control over a broad range of environmental factors, however, and evidence from such procedures indicates the possibility of investigating child behavior and development through the use of reinforcement, punishment, and extinction contingencies.

When the linkage is sufficiently well developed, the child can be helped to see the relationship between his pleasure and those activities which provide it. To establish the linkage, preschool children with behavior problems were introduced into a program in which adults observed the child's personality problems and,  through reinforcement, attempted to modify the undesirable behavior into desirable behavior. The program was for an hour two times a week for most of a school year. The three case histories of this report include (1) a 3-year-old girl with serious behavior problems and possible retardation, (2) a 3 1/2-year-old boy who had suffered physical deformities and was behind his peers socially and educationally, and (3) a 5-year-old boy who was of normal development physically but came from a poor home environment. Individual goals were set for each child of the study, and it was found that the program did help each child to develop more desirable and self-satisfying behavior. (WD)",

Three paradigms demonstrate mediation effect in paired-associate learning: response equivalence, stimulus equivalence, and chaining model. By reviewing children's language acquisition patterns in terms of the three paradigms, several conclusions were reached. A child utters words which are related to his experience. He establishes response and stimulus equivalence paradigms simultaneously. In a response equivalence situation, he learns one response can apply to several stimuli, and in a stimulus equivalence situation, one stimulus is paired with many responses. When learning complex utterances, the child chains equivalence  paradigms. The same patterns are applied in learning plurals, tenses, and negatives. In an addendum, the author discusses the positions of a psychologist and a linguist in language acquisition. The psychologist ignores the complexities of the language, oversimplifies imitation, and disregards the relationship between memorizing and meaningful learning. The linguist assumes hierarchical learning but does not test it, and he rejects mediation learning theories. Although maintaining separate goals, the two schools should act jointly to stimulate needed further research in language acquisition. (JS)",

From August 1965 to August 1966, 157 programs administered to 1,663 children explored mental ability, auditory and visual discrimination, language use, vocabulary, and motivation. Children attending day care centers, nursery schools, and Head Start classes were tested, and the following observations were noted: (1) childre n from poor homes have inferior ability to discriminate spoken word sounds; (2) when children are given interesting materials, their verbal output shows no differentiation; and (3) motivation is equal in advantaged and disadvantaged children. New tests are needed to measure vocabulary, auditory and visual discriminations. Experimental  studies proved three-dimensional toys do not produce superior learning, and repetition of grammatical sentences is preferred to story-telling in developing verbal fluency. As a result of assessments and experiments, the project proposes a 30-week program to develop familiarity and facility with language in science, mathematics, social studies, literature, language usage, and logical processes on a preschool level. The program would occupy only 15 minuets of the school day and would not minimize the productive value of present day care center programs. (DO)",

Habituation (decrease in fixation time) increased with age of the child. However, no response increment was found upon the change to the novel stimulus (the helix  pattern). Experiment two used 80 infants of 3, 6, 9, and 13 months of age. Here, four helix trials were followed by one point pattern trial. The results were similar to experiment one. Experiment three repeated the procedure of experiment one in longitudinal-study form; that is, all of the infants in the experiment were tested at 3, 6, 9, and 13 months of age.

Current research is aided by the advanced state of knowledge, convergence of learning and developmental theories, and intensive study of cognitive processes, but much of  it concentrates on socially disadvantaged children. A systematic research utilizing dimensions for designing developmental stimulation programs could concentrate on the gifted child. Early and intensive stimulation and pervasive environmental arrangements provided by parents are factors of the gifted child's intelligence. Stimulation control over bright children is a compelling illustration of the proposition of the developmental learning hypothesis. Further research is needed. (DO)",

Factors included test anxiety, remote school concern, poor self-evaluation and somatic signs of anxiety. Factor analysis demonstrates a stable multidimensional structure for TASC. Results indicate independent dimensions are required. While the questions comprising TASC admit a full range of anxiety reactions, the test is limited to academic evaluation. Additional analyses of anxiety could include comparisons to situations occurring outside of school The second grade data indicate that the stimulus class in TASC needs delimiting by distinguishing between formal test and other school evaluation situations and that there is  more than one mode of anxiety response to school evaluation situations. To understand the nature of components of anxiety, measures of anxiety to test and affiliative situations could be included in a single factor analysis. A sampling of all stimuli and responses would define their independent and interactive effects on anxiety. While TASC scores and school achievement measures differ, later research will determine if this is caused by only some dimensions underlying responses to TASC. After explorations, TASC should be expanded so that several dimensions have adequate item coverage. (DO)",

        "description":"To determine whether children's language patterns are learned responses or inherently organized, this study observed children's responses to commands. The 13 subjects were middle class children aged 18 to 30 months. The children were rated as verbally mature, intermediate, or immature; and responses were classified as action, verbal, and relevant. The children's mothers gave syntactically varied commands (adults' and children's language patterns) and semantically varied commands (English and nonsense words). The results showed that the children responded more to the well-formed command. There was a significantly positive relationship between verbal maturity and obedience to command. A significant number of children responded less frequently to nonsense commands than English words  except to repeat the command. The only relationship between responses and verbal maturity occurred where the verbally mature child repeated the nonsense command. Three conclusions were reached: (1) the child does make distinctions at some stage, although it may not be evident in speech; (2) the distinctions vary with verbal maturity; and (3) the child has some means of organizing language to control new information. A number of references are cited, and data are included in appendixes. (JS)",

The prekindergarten research involved matched groups of children (91 experimental, 115 control), representative of the local population, whose developmental needs (motor, auditory, language, visual retention) were identified by a test battery. Half-day classes focused on specific need for 20 minutes daily. Activities were conducted within the framework of a well-balanced prekindergarten program. Results indicated that the experimental group excelled the control group not participating in the program at a statistically significant level of confidence. The kindergarten experiment was a followup study of the prekindergarten children of the previous year (80 experimental, 124 control). These children attended many different  kindergarten programs. Results indicated that the experimental group did not maintain the superiority at a statistically significant level from the previous year. The effect of prekindergarten experience on primary school success will be measured during the third year of the project. (Author/JS)",

However, more Anglo boys expressed a desire to quit school while more Mexican-American youth expressed a desire to do graduate work.

Data from the student's acculturation questionnaire indicated that the Spanish American student's operation was comparable to the Anglo American student in incorporation of culture value concepts. The data from the teacher awareness scale indicated that teachers were aware of differences between the 2 ethnic groups. The study recommended: (1) recognition of compatible Spanish American culture value concepts; (2) realization of the value of  group conformity in gaining acceptance; (3) awareness by the educational structure of the complex needs arising from biculturalism; and (4) utilization by teachers of sociometric techniques for measurement of group interaction.

Interviews were conducted by graduate students who read each stimulus question aloud as the respondents answered the question. Questionnaires were completed by 669 of the 765 sophomores enrolled in the selected schools at the time of the interview. The primary concern of the study was to provide descriptive information; therefore, no tests of statistical difference were employed. It was concluded that a large number of the Mexican American youth in the study desired  high-level occupations, and a major policy implication was that these youth needed adequate preparation which they were not receiving to prepare them for the occupational goals they preferred.

An especially strong relationship between educational attainment and occupational attainment was found. A large proportion of the variance was left unexplained. Therefore, other significant variables must be added to the model to determine more fully the factors that enable youth to raise their educational and occupational goals.

The objectives of the project were: (1) to study in depth a depressed rural area and to identify conditions and trends that typify the area; (2) to develop and conduct a model vocationally-oriented education program; and (3) to evaluate the model program through an experimental treatment. Disadvantaged rural families, primarily concentrated in 20 counties in Illinois, served as the population universe. The PERT technique was adopted to provide a guide for the management of events and activities. The project was designed to be conducted in 5 correlated phases. At the time of this report, Phase 4 was nearing its midpoint. The  Appendices contain major event PERT charts, information collected, instrumentation, and phase activities.

        "description":"One aspect of Project REDY (Rural Education-Disadvantaged Youth) was to explore the degree of upward social and occupational mobility which society might realiztically expect from residents of a rural economically depressed area. Social class structure was identified as a related factor and examined in a rural, Southern Illinois county. It was found that the sociological phenomenon of class stratification of the economically depressed area studied was characterized as primarily middle, upper-working, and working class. It was concluded that an agrarian economically depressed area generally contained youth and adults who wanted to and would work. However, the majority of the youth and adults tended to select lower status occupations due to local availability and social  circumstances. An implication drawn from the study was that full development of economically depressed rural areas will occur when business, industry, and education join forces in a planned, systematic attack on economic and social problems.

One hundred and ninety-two entering first graders (half Negro, half white; half boys, half girls) were selected in two rural Southern counties at the initial stages of a desegregation program. The socioeconomic level of the groups was controlled so that half of each group belonged in grades 6 and 7 and half belonged in grades 1 through 5. The Metropolitan Readiness Test and the Children's Self-Social Constructs Test (preschool form) were given within the first few weeks of school. After 6 weeks, teachers were asked to rate all subjects on 24 bipolar dimensions of classroom behavior including follows directions and talks to other children. Intercorrelational analysis based  on the total sample indicated a high relationship between readiness and eight of the 17 variables. Among the eight, preschool education, teachers' ratings, and age were the best predictors. Among the other significant relationships were distance from teacher, realism for size, and preference for mother. The data seem to indicate that meaningful social experience is as important as training in decoding skills for reading readiness. References are given. (WL)",

Tutors are usually housewives with at least a high school education. They are required only to judge the correctness of reading responses and the acceptability of question answers. During the development of programed tutoring, more than 3,000 children have been tutored in about 60 schools. There are now 10 operational programs designed to teach the basic reading skills. Research indicates that programed tutoring used as a supplement to regular classroom teaching is more effective than either method alone. The results of a recent field test comparing programed tutoring and directed tutoring  in which the subjects were 120 first-grade students in 20 Indianapolis schools suggest that programed tutoring, in its present form, utilized twice daily in 15-minute sessions as a supplement to conventional classroom instruction can significantly improve reading achievement. However, further research is needed to discover the conditions under which programed tutors make significant contributions to learning. Their degree of effectiveness finally must be evaluated by the performance of the children they teach. (BS)",

The Delacato approach emphasizes the development of neurological organization and laterality. It may be useful for a small percentage of children with severe reading disabilities, but its value has not been substantiated. The Kephart approach proposes the development of learning readiness through exercises which develop balance and motor control, eye-hand coordination, and directionality. A third approach stresses specific perceptual training. It resulted from the development of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities and the Frostig Developmental Tests of Visual Perception. The possible contribution of  pharmacology to remedial education is explored by an approach which suggests the use of drugs for children with reading disabilities. These four approaches, however, have failed to produce conclusive evidence of their effectiveness. More carefully controlled research is recommended.

The kinds of thinking elicited by teachers' questions were investigated by means of a classification scheme developed which included recognition, recall, translation, conjecture, explanation, and evaluation. The characteristic patterns of teachers' questioning behaviors used to control students' responses were categorized into Immediate Right Answer, No Answer Permitted, No Answer Received, and Extending Answers. Question clusters used by teachers to relate the thinking of two or more questions were classified into Setting Purpose-Followup, Verification, Judgmental, and Justification. An analysis of 1,857 questions of  12 randomly selected second- , fourth-, and sixth-grade teachers showed that the teachers tended to emphasize questions which required recall thinking. While they used several controlling actions to cue, clarify, extend, or shut off the students' thinking, they tended to use the Immediate Right Answer pattern. Teachers failed to put questions into clusters which would extend students' thinking and comprehension of the material read. (NS)",

Reasoning is discussed as a criterion necessary to decode an author's thought and language. It is identified as a requisite to perceiving the association of ideas and the organization of thought in a written work. Courses in logic at the high school level are advocated strongly. Reflection is designated as  essential to avoiding the intellectual sterility. It is noted that in this age of mass communication, reading remains unique in its individualized approach.

The program was designed to help underachieving third and fourth graders solve reading problems by participating in a small class group for one-fourth to one-half of the school day. Seven of the 36 transition room teachers were interviewed to determine the compatibility of the transition room with the total school setting in respect to the use of student and teacher time, facilities, and media. The formal program definition was  then evaluated with respect to its comprehensiveness and face validity. Metropolitan Achievement Test scores (paragraph meaning subtest) were compared for an experimental and a control group , and findings and conclusions are presented.

Emphasis is placed on the suggestions that attendance not be mandatory, that separate programs be provided each year for new teachers, that actual teaching problems be treated,  and that the program be continuous. Two organizational suggestions propose preparatory reading committees to initiate faculty interest, and overall attendance and participation by teachers, principals, and reading consultants to insure success. Formal and informal evaluation methods are suggested, with emphasis on the 11 criteria of the International Reading Association's \"Conducting In-Service Programs in Reading.\" Several exemplary programs are described.

Three experimental reading methods were used: the Imperial Productions Self-Directive Program, the Stern Structured Linguistics, and the Sullivan Programed Reading. Two nonexperimental methods were also used: traditional phonics and eclectic approaches. Presession and post-session questionnaires, the Botel  Phonics Inventory, the Reading subtest of the Metropolitan Achievement Test, and other tests were administered. It was concluded that all post-test means were significantly higher than pretest means. None of the five reading methods was significantly better than the others.

The materials used for comparative analysis were selected cloze passages read aloud by 30 primary grade children. Percent of errors was recorded for reading of the words not deleted, and grade level readability scores were computed by the Readability Graph and the Spache Formula. Rank order correlations showed highly consistent correlations for all four methods. The Readability Graph yielded  about the same level scores as the Spache Formula. The cloze method was judged to be the most accurate and the most capable of making fine distinctions; however its use is limited because it requires a group of subjects to read the selections for evaluation at a given time.

The college transcripts of these teachers were examined to ascertain how many quarter hours of college credit the teachers had received in courses identified as either mathematics or mathematics education. Results of the study indicated that (1) less than four per cent of new teachers certified for the elementary level in Colorado schools had the amount of mathematics preparation recommended by the Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics, and (2) teacher preparation is not uniform in the academic subjects  either among the states or among institutions within the states. A second study was undertaken to determine if there was any significant correlation between scores on a pre-test of mathematics understanding and the teachers' years of experience. The conclusion was that there was no correlation between years of experience and test scores. Therefore, the opinion that newly graduated teachers are in as much need of mathematics inservice education as experienced teachers was substantiated. (RP)",

One of the reports is an analysis of 43 books in elementary mathematics that are in use in various states of the country. The purpose of this study was to obtain an analytical opinion from the teachers about the textbooks in actual use for teaching elementary mathematics. This information was classified according to general information, general organization of the textbooks, subject matter, style of  writing, pictorial and graphic illustrations, and objectives. The second report is an analysis of a limited survey of 30 schools selected from four states of India. The purpose of this study was to determine the current teaching-learning practices followed by teachers and students in the study of elementary mathematics. A factual account of what was observed in classes by the investigators and reported by teachers and students during interviews is reported for the following areas: (1) motivation, (2) continuity, (3) teaching new concepts, (4) problem solving, (5) individual and group work, (6) homework, and (7) teaching aids.

One of the studies used fourth grade subjects and a programed presentation of addition and multiplication of integers; the second used sixth grade subjects and a programed presentation of modulus seven arithmetic; the third used eighth grade subjects and a programed presentation of selected topics from vector arithmetic. Within each of three ability subgroups, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. The results of the studies  indicated that (1) the high ability subgroup had mean scores significantly greater than those for the middle ability subgroups which in turn had mean scores significantly higher than those of the low ability subgroups, and (2) the significant differences pertaining to treatment effects favored the maximal guidance treatment. It was concluded, therefore, that when mathematics instruction is provided by means of a linear program, a relatively high level of guidance should be provided. (RP)",

This was abandoned in favor of tables presenting information relative to material availability, organization of equipment, relative percentage of materials to be purchased locally, types and uses of printed material, and other miscellaneous information. The Science-Mathematics Study sought to evaluate the effect of the &quot;new&quot; science and mathematics programs on students and teachers. Findings and conclusions are reported in the newsletter.

The research revealed that it is possible to construct programming  languages that can be effectively taught to elementary school children. Children are easily motivated to write programs at consoles, and programming work can facilitate the acquisition of rigorous thinking and expression. Such mathematical concepts as variable, equation, function, and algorithm can be presented with clarity in the context of programming. (RP)",

        "description":"In the program &quot;Motivation in Depth for Gifted High School Science Students&quot; initiated in 1964, specially selected seventh grade students took in successive summers Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), Chemical Education Materials Study, (CHEMS), and Physical Science Study Committee (PSSC) courses; a newly designed course, Laboratory Orientation and Instrumentation; and two academic years in the Laboratory Research Program. Evaluation was to determine program feasibility, collect selected data, and analyze differences between the experimental students and matched control students on the California Occupational Interest Inventory (COII). Feasibility was demonstrated by these observations: (1) 91.7 per cent of all class performances met school requirements; (2)  participating students in BSCS and PSSC obtained scores on national tests more favorable than national controls; (3) participants performed satisfactorily compared with controls who took the regular academic program in tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades. Data have been collected over the duration of the program by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and specially constructed structured interviews, and by group Rorschach, Bell Personality Inventory and COII. Analysis of the COII revealed a significant increase in the difference between experimental and matched control students in the personal-social factor. (GR)",

        "description":"Six tests were constructed, four on a pictorial level and two on a symbolic level, to measure the performance of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade children, in three different ability groups, on problems concerning ratios or fractions. Two variables were of interest in the four tests on a pictorial level: (a) &quot;equal&quot; ratio situations vs. &quot;equal&quot; fraction situations, and (b) missing numerator vs. missing denominator. The two levels of the two variables of interest defined the four tests: (1) &quot;equal&quot; ratios with a missing numerator, (2) &quot;equal&quot; ratios with a missing denominator, (3) &quot;equal&quot; fractions with a missing numerator, and (4) &quot;equal&quot; fractions with a missing denominator. All four tests involved reductions. Variable (b) defined the two tests on a symbolic level. Very low  correlations between the pictorial and symbolic tests indicated that a different understanding was required for each; the authors suggest a number of steps that may be taken to develop appropriate abilities in children.

Pretest results showed that the experimental group students started at significantly lower ability levels in reading, verbal reasoning, abstract reasoning, numerical ability, and chemical knowledge. Despite this starting position, the experimental group made substantial gains on the standardized chemistry test, and almost doubled the gains made by the control group on a special chemistry test.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether a significant relationship exists between the teacher's judgment of her pupils' social status and the pupils'\"actual social rank\" in the class. Six teachers (one for each grade from one through six) in a selected northern Indiana elementary school were given forms listing their pupils' names accompanied by three columns designated \"work companion,\"\"play companion,\" and \"seat companion.\" On these forms, teachers ranked their pupils according to how they perceived each pupil's acceptance by his classmates in each of the areas. Then three different sociometric tests were administered to the pupils so they could rank each other in each of the three areas. The Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient was used to determine the  relationship between the teachers' judgments of pupils' sociometric status and the actual sociometric status as measured by the sociometric tests. It was concluded \"that there is a difference between teachers in the accuracy of their judgments concerning the sociometric status of their pupils.\" Therefore, it is recommended that further research be conducted in this area in order to determine how teachers' judgments may be improved so that teachers can, in turn, become more effective in promoting the social adjustment of pupils.

Applications of modified PO approaches were made on selected Head Start and elementary school classes in connection with 2 concurrent projects. Eleven experienced teachers received observer training in PO theory. Films were made of a stratified sample of classes for use in training and for analysis of observational reports and ratings. In one project 8 scales were used in rating 16 teachers; rater agreement was 92% and interscale correlations varied between .60 and .90. In the  other project an observational survey of 38 classes over a 5-month period produced intercorrelation between 10 scales ranging between .60 and .80; the internal consistency of the scales is well documented. Since complete data is not yet available, this report is incomplete.

        "description":"Leading the teaching profession toward the best possible instructional programs for children and youth will be difficult because our concepts of teaching must change fundamentally. The intensity of the school must be enormously increased in light of other more potent factors determining what a child learns and becomes. In the current era human-to-human instruction is in full bloom; one job for the next 10 to 15 years is to implement the human-based innovations we have been talking about for the past 15 years. The era of man-machine interaction will replace the current era; the problem is not whether we like the idea but what we are going to do about it. We must identify the truly human tasks of the human teacher and the more routine, highly programed tasks which can be done  better by the computer. A third, still embryonic era is the future one in which the school as we know it will be obsolete. It will be replaced by a diffused learning environment (homes with computer consoles, public parks and museums, and an array of guidance and programing centers) in which the formal process of instruction must involve all the most able members of our society. The means of humanizing 21st century education must seriously occupy our attention in the next decade, but we may also need to raise new questions about the ends. What kinds of human beings do we wish to produce? (JS)",

The symposium participants were all elementary schoolteachers who had just completed their fourth month of teaching, had graduated from teacher training institutions in June 1967, and had been recommended by their preparing institutions as outstanding graduates. Jerome Bruner, director of the Center for Cognitive Studies, Harvard University, was symposium chairman. The proceedings of the symposium indicated that \"if feedback from beginning teachers is a reliable source then it is very apparent that what is being done in the colleges of education has little relation to the on-the-job requirements of elementary teachers.\"  Twelve recommendations regarding teacher training evolved.

Three major hypotheses were considered: (1) that observation of classes would result in a significant change in student attitudes toward selected aspects of teaching, (2) that student attitudes would shift toward those held by the present teaching faculty at the school in which they observed, and (3) that the attitudes of the McCaskill Laboratory School Faculty, Wisconsin State University, Superior, would vary significantly from the attitudes of the education majors in the study. Thirty-three education majors without observation experience were identified and were divided randomly into control and experimental groups. The control  group was restricted from observation during the experimental period while the experimental group made five 30-minute observations of classes. Pretest and posttest measurements were administered to assess attitudes toward such aspects as student teaching, teaching, discipline, and children. A semantic differential was employed as the measuring device. Analysis of the data led to rejection of all three hypotheses. (Author/SG)",

Twenty-four students participated in the program which provided four hours of activity daily, two to four hours of which were spent in teaching. Principles of using video tape for studying lesson presentation were taught, and the students observed themselves teaching peers before entering the regular classroom. High school student teachers spent eight weeks teaching, and junior high school student teachers spent six weeks. Subsequently, the junior high school student teachers spent additional time learning to operate the video tape recorder and preparing a report on junior high school teaching. To evaluate the summer professional  semester, a questionnaire was administered to the 24 participating students and to 51 student teachers in the regular professional semester. Also, the Teacher Classroom Activity Profile (developed at ISU) was used to compare the teaching skills of the summer student teachers with those of the regular student teachers. Although it was found that certain problems inherent in the summer professional semester, the program proved feasible, and recommendations for improvement were evolved.

In 1968, the American educational dilemma is economic, political, scientific and technical, humanistic, social, private as well as public, and professional. A revitalized system of education is needed; the task of the 1,200 colleges and universities that prepare teachers is formidable. To obtain charismatic teachers who are successful, exciting people, salaries must be increased and full-time and shared assistants used to relieve routine drudgery. Moreover, selectivity is necessary, eliminating rigid credit-hour requirements in favor of emphasizing experiences and accomplishments. It is necessary to obtain more  flexible teacher certification and reciprocal agreements among all states. Frontiers to be investigated include occupational education, early childhood development, and research evaluation. Interinstitutional cooperation between school systems and teacher preparatory institutions is required. Perhaps colleges and universities could contract with school systems to manage problem-plagued schools, thus improving the image of these schools and providing freedom necessary to facilitate innovation and to study the learning process.

The teacher-director devoted full time to the program, the clinical instructor one-quarter time, and the clinical professor one-eighth time. After initial planning and preparation, the interns  assumed full responsibility for their classes. Self-evaluation through video tape recordings, interschool visits, analysis of each other's teaching, and joint planning also were intern activities. For evaluation purposes, questionnaires were distributed to interns, clinical instructors, teacher-directors, and school administrators halfway through the program and upon completion of the program. Individual tape-recorded interviews were held with the same people. A more complete evaluation will involve follow-up of the interns as they assume regular teaching positions. (SG)",

        "description":"Fundamental to evaluating the effectiveness of teacher education is determining whether the theory and practice of preservice training carry over into inservice teaching. Considering the large number of beginning teachers who soon drop out of teaching, it appears that they do not. Possibly teacher educators have put too much reliance on the concept of transfer. A review of the literature reveals that transfer may not be the sole factor in the learning process; only in earlier studies of transfer are individual differences accounted for, usually by recognizing intelligence as a major determinant in the transfer process. The success of a beginning teacher may be due to his personal adaptability to the principal, the pupils, the setting, and the role expectations he must face in his  teaching assignment rather than to any similarity between his student teaching practice and his first teaching situation. Consequently, \"it seems . . . that teacher education will be better served by seeking to learn more ways of developing elements within individuals rather than trying to reconstruct identical situational elements between preservice and in-service experiences.\" The task of teacher educators is to stimulate professional commitment in their students by serving as models of good teaching practice, with the laboratory experience serving to mold individual students' perceptions of the teaching profession.

Educators must immediately concern themselves with reconstituting the substance of teacher education through empirically validated knowledge. Studies concerning teaching methodology, the systematic observation of classroom behavior, instruments and media of instruction, the open and closed mind, concept development, paradigms for research on teaching, and the dynamics of group interaction should be at the heart of the reconstruction process. Although teaching  behavior is being studied and research is beginning to have an impact on some programs, much remains to be done. Research is needed on education as a social institution and on the school as a social system so that educational objectives can be set for schools in the setting in which the schools function. The impact of sociological factors on the role of the teacher needs study, and recent trends and developments such as team teaching and programed learning need further analysis and evaluation.

Because each student's cognitive operations, his approach to cognitive tasks, and his feelings about knowledge are personally unique, they cannot be disregarded by the curriculum builder. A total program focusing on the personal dimension of teacher education is needed. It would provide a one-to-one relationship between each prospective teacher and at least one education advisor. Rather than a specific  sequence of courses, it might use a continuous seminar taught by an instructional team and make use of student grouping and teams of students with opportunity for continuous and appropriate independent study. Simulated materials, sensitivity training, programed instruction, educational TV, and data processing would be used to implement such an individualized curriculum.

        "description":"In an attempt to give college seniors sufficient experience to prepare them for the difficulties of their initial teaching assignments in disadvantaged neighborhoods, the Triplet Project was created by Hunter College of the City University of N.Y. A college supervisor and 12 student teachers are assigned to each of two &quot;triplets&quot; (groups of three participating elementary schools within a block or two from each other--one in East Harlem and one in the East Bronx). Since the supervisor functions as a resident in the schools, he is able to observe each of his students (four in each school) 15 times a semester and to have conferences with him immediately after a lesson. He becomes well known in the schools, &quot;a part of the woodwork,&quot; so that his presence in the classroom does not  create an unrealistic situation. He tailors appropriate experiences for student teachers and sometimes does demonstration teaching. Each student teacher has two 9-week placements, one in the first to third grades and one in the fourth to sixth. He teaches at least one lesson a day for three weeks, two consecutive lessons for two weeks, and later teaches for an entire morning on several occasions. The Triplet Project has now come full circle in that some of the outstanding initial student teachers are now cooperating teachers. When school principals were asked to compare the performance of Triplet Project regular teachers in their schools with other beginning teachers who had had student teaching experience, 50 per cent were rated above average and 40 per cent excellent.

        "description":"Brooklyn Center of Long Island University has developed a number of student teaching centers. (Such &quot;centers&quot; are schools with which an agreement has been reached providing for the placement of student teachers in concentrated numbers, thus allowing for resident supervision. An extension of the Campus School concept, they continue the trend toward formal agreement between colleges and public schools in concern for teacher preparation.) Resident college supervisors (full-time faculty members with usually one-half to three-fourth of their teaching load consisting of the supervision of student teachers in one school) spend 12 to 18 hours a week in the school, making them available also for conference and other resource services. The role of the college coordinator of field work (a  full-time administrator with faculty rank) involves assigning supervisors and student teachers to positions at specific centers. The coordinator keeps in close contact with each of the schools, meets frequently with students, and continually discusses the field work program with divisional faculty. When students are accepted into the program, they are invited in groups of 10 to 12 to two-hour conferences with the coordinator; the group dynamics approach to student teaching in urban schools gives the coordinator a perceptive view of each student in anticipating that student's readiness for a given assignment.

Over a two-year period, 65 elementary school teachers were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups formed from the presence or absence of three conditions: (1) self-observation via video tape recording, (2) overt self-evaluation during self-observation, and (3) a workshop in observational and evaluational techniques. Analysis of variance, discriminatory analysis, and chi square techniques were used to analyze the data collected from behavioral measures and questionnaires.

Significant advances have already been made by international organizations such as UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World University; by national groups such as the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE), the North Central Association, Education and World Affairs, and the Education Materials Laboratory; and by programs conducted at college and university, regional, state, and local levels. Teacher education institutions can play a key role in developing cultural appreciation and intercultural understanding as they guide the growth and development of future teachers. Teacher educators must &quot;identify,  state clearly, and clarify from time to time special information, attitudes, appreciations, and skills that are intimately related to world-mindedness.&quot; Frank appraisal of existing programs is needed. Additional means for improving international understanding include further research into cultural backgrounds in relation to curriculum improvement, establishment of an independent international curriculum laboratory and materials center, development of world college centers, and establishment of an independent foundation for international education.

A group testing procedure was utilized by reproducing the PPVT plates on 35 millimeter transparent slides and projecting them onto a 60 by 60 inch screen. A sample of 414 fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade pupils was tested twice with Form A and Form B, requiring one-half hour to administer separately and 1 hour when combined into one longer test. Alternate form reliability compared favorably with the PPVT manual, but an unforeseen difficulty in administering the test under group conditions was that ceiling scores had to be established individually for 161 pupils and  basal scores for 15. Test-retest reliability coefficients ranged from .73 to .85. Combining the two forms into one test yielded test-retest reliability coefficients of .90, .88, and .84 for the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades respectively. Since reliability increased with the use of the combined test forms, psychometrists should give serious consideration to using both forms of the test as one longer instrument. Validity studies comparing group forms with individual forms are needed. (Author/LH)",

In the story of the quest of the forces of good to destroy a power-giving ring which corrupts the one who wears it, students easily recognize the central theme--the corruptive tendency of power. Although the Romantic Quest is important, the trilogy is an epic in which the conflict between good and evil is clear and definite.

In a related pilot project, college undergraduates developed a unit on contemporary poetry that they taught at a vocational high school in Baltimore. Findings of the Collaborative suggested that professional writers inspire students to write in ways that their teachers do not envision; that all children have an intense inner life and an  awareness of sex, violence, power, and other strong emotions; and that many teachers are willing to change to less authoritarian teaching styles.

The curriculum provides increased emphasis upon the non-western world, behavioral sciences, structure in disciplines, the study of value conflicts, teaching pupils inquiry methods, and inquiry teaching-strategies. The program is designed for pupils of different ability levels. The Center has prepared resource units and a general guide at each grade level and has written some pupil materials to supplement those available commercially. Courses and units  have been field-tested and revised in the light of teacher feedback. The Center has experimented with an inservice training program which employs teachers who have taught the new courses to train other teachers.

In one survey, students were asked to match stimulus words with regions of the world. In a second survey, a multiple choice test consisting of questions exclusively on Africa was used. The results of these surveys indicated that students have a stereotyped and inaccurate image of the region and that their basic knowledge about it is minimal. The conclusion is that, because students leaving secondary school should have a basic understanding of Africa, the region south of the  Sahara must receive more adequate treatment, in both quantity and quality, than it presently does receive.

Instead of two classes meeting three times a week, the regular instructor has three classes meeting two times a week. The undergraduate assistant supervises the third meeting in which several classes are combined and the students usually complete a writing assignment. The duties of the assistant consist of helping to mark papers, conferring with students about their errors, and relieving the regular instructor of many clerical chores. Tentative results indicate that the quality of  instruction has not suffered and that a large saving in money and classroom space is possible. (BN)",

It is noted that a national commitment to equal opportunity must involve all the other governmental bodies and civic and welfare organizations in addition to school systems. (NH)",

        "description":"The compulsory system of education is criticized on the grounds that it has become a regimented \"universal trap\" antithetical to democracy. In contrast to the Jeffersonian concept of education in the service of citizen initiative for the preservation of freedom, current compulsory education is a tool of industrialism and of a rigidly stratified society. The schools do not even reflect middle-class values. Their significant strengths are, in fact, petty-bourgeois. When poor youth are confined in a situation which is useless and damaging to them, they drop out, either actually or behaviorally, a response which could be termed life-preservative. The sterility of traditional education and the conformity it demands are also questioned. Possible alternatives are having no school at all  for a few selected classes, conducting school work in the community rather than in the school building, using community adults as \"teachers,\" and establishing a policy of voluntary attendance. Other suggestions include decentralizing the urban school into small units, using store-fronts as classrooms, and sending urban children to farms for a few months, thus helping perhaps to stimulate a new kind of rural life.

The introduction deals with historical and legal background and the problem of integration in a pluralistic society; a summary of the Panel's findings, recommendations with their rationale; and a general discussion of implementation. The panel's findings on de facto segregation are discussed in relation to racial composition of student body (schools are defined as integrated when they are at least 10% Negro and 10% white), and the racial distribution of teachers. Quality of Education in white, integrated, and Negro schools is  discussed in terms of overcrowding; class size; student-staff ratio; teaching staff; attendances; dropouts and mobility; achievement; curriculum and teaching methods; and physical facilities. Recommendations, based on the currently accepted premises about the value of desegregation, stress that the principle of the neighborhood school must be modified to achieve the &quot;higher priority&quot; of expanding &quot;the freedom of individual choice.&quot; Appendices include policy statements, social-psychological material on segregation, and tables of data on which recommendations were based.

Each of these areas was integrated into the total &quot;Higher Horizons 100&quot; program and evaluated by formal and informal assessments. Findings show no significant changes in I.Q. scores during the first year. However, there was significant  improvement in reading achievement scores, writing skills, and general achievement test scores, but no significant changes were found in school attitudes or in attendance patterns. The inclusion of cultural activities was a successful innovation. (NH)",

In 1961, (N=40) and 1965 (N=80), samples of marginal (poorly suited) and regular (better suited) students in small and large schools were interviewed concerning \"reasons for or pulls toward\" attending selected nonclass activities, and responses were coded into categories indicating sense of obligation.

Also presented is a discussion of the importance of cultural bias in tests and of the various correlations of IQ and learning tests. It is felt that \"heritability\" offers a more useful criterion to account for the extent of the cultural loading dimension. Postulated is the simplest possible model to explain IQ differences, a hypothesis which formulates two types of mental processes, Level I (associative  learning) and Level II (abstract problem solving and conceptual learning). Empirical findings are then more understandable when three further hypotheses are considered--(1) there is a genotypic independence of Level 1; and (3) genotypes are differentially distributed in upper and lower social classes.

        "description":"Equal education has traditionally meant free education offering a common curriculum to all children attenting a school in a given locality. However, since the 1954 Supreme Court decision and the Equality of Educational Opportunity survey, implicit assumptions have been challenged by a new concept: equality of opportunity is dependent upon the effects of schooling. At present, educational equality is determined more by the ability of resource inputs to bring about achievement than by the equality of the inputs themselves. This concept implies that the responsibility for achievement rests with the school, not the child. The school might implement this responsibility, particularly for assuring that lower class children learn reading and arithmetic, by contractual arrangements with  entrepreneurs outside the school system. This innovation should involve released time plans, private contractors who are paid by results, and free choice for the consumer (parents). Guarantees of racial and social class integration would be built into the contracts. Social integration in large urban school systems can be encouraged by contractual arrangements for interschool activities and programs. (NH)",

The participants recommended a clinical-diagnostic and individualized approach in teaching, with guidance services provided.

In addition, the apparent diversity among institutions is of little value because institutions are not located or administered in such a way that individuals can choose freely between them. Decentralization and equal access to every school might effectively alter the monolithic pattern of school organization. Another innovation, which would provide for dissenters from majority-dominated school policies, would be to establish scholarships for attendance at either neighboring public schools or at private schools. At the college level, universalization of higher education and the academic profession's increasing power over collegiate  organization and standards are trends that threaten to eliminate diversity. Commuter colleges will increasingly replace residential ones, and all seem to be turning into Ph.D. preparatory institutions. Alternatives to the years of boredom in the classroom must be found in order to forestall the increasing alienation and anger of youth. (NH)",

Too often an oversimplified casual relationship is drawn which explains the educational gap between white and Negro students in de facto segregated schools. Other factors considered in analyzing educational status differences are quality of teaching, home and neighborhood influences, and the nature of the influence of biracial classes on pupils of both races. A simple count of the concentration of Negroes in a given school becomes sufficient motivation for many parents to press for desegregation. The suggested integration methods of pairing, redistricting, busing, and new school locations can be effective measures, especially in small communities.  Integrating the inner core area schools of large cities, however, raises special problems which can be resolved in varying degrees by free choice transfer policies, opening special schools in ghetto areas for which white students would be recruited, and cooperation between public schools and prestigious universities, church groups, and private schools.

The polarity of the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; limits the schools' services to the latter group because of the generally moderate stance of most liberal school board members and their insufficient zeal in pressing the grievances of the have-nots. Bureaucratic resistance and the role of conservatives in paring school budgets are further obstructions. This kind of class conflict also permeates congressional and state aid to education. Documentary evidence of conditions in Chicago and New York City schools corroborate the statement that the class conflict is reflected in school inequalities and class-biased training. Ethnic roles are also interconnected with class roles, with the Jewish community often acting as the &quot;swing&quot; group on  polarized issues. A new and difficult problem for urban schools is the massive task of racial acculturation. Breakthroughs may possibly come through political pressures, increased civil rights activity, amalgamation of lower-class groups, Federal aid programs and voluntary and private efforts. Increased college opportunities, instructional innovations, unionization of teachers, and decentralization may also improve the educational quality of urban schools. (NH)",

A large portion of the article traces the various Board of Education attempts to integrate the schools and the response and demands of civil rights groups. A 1-day school boycott called in February 1964, to protest the inadequacy of the Board's pairing proposals may have forced a stronger integration plan from the Board. Although the boycott had positive effects on Negro self-respect, it did not solve the financial shortages faced by the city's school system or the problems of curriculum, bureaucratic administration, poor  teaching quality, and the pulls of various pressure groups. Moreover, the boycott did not come to grips with the broader political issue of the need for the amalgamation of Negroes with others in the working class to transform other social institutions. It is felt that educational problems are insoluble unless there is a truly free society which values individuality, creativity, art, science, and knowledge more than it values competition and accumulation.

In 1964 the Board resolved to eliminate defacto segregation and a citizen's commission was appointed to develop a plan. Aided by computer experts, a redistribution of students was worked out which used the schools more efficiently while conserving some of the neighborhood schools concept. The racial balance of Negroes in any school ranged from 17 to 25 percent. One-way busing appeared to be a pragmatic, although perhaps unfair, way to desegregate. This device was instituted only after a well-prepared survey revealed that 92 percent of the Negro parents approved. Although housing patterns determine defacto segregation, nevertheless the schools have a responsibility to initiate  change in their own province. It is also pointed out that protest activity by civil rights groups was an important spur to movement by the Board. As of 1967, all schools are fully integrated physically. Now the community must work toward &quot;psychological integration.&quot; (NH)",

The major factors which distinguished the group of achievers from the group of underachievers were those in the area of quality of interpersonal relationships, clarity of self-definition, and positive self-evaluation. The heterogeneity of this group of children, all of whom are often glibly referred to as 'disadvantaged', suggests the need for greater precision in the definition of various aspects of social disadvantage as they relate to the development of personality. Also consideration of these personality dimensions becomes important in War on Poverty programs, since the  characteristics of our achieving group seem to be necessarily present in order for maximal benefit to be derived from enrichment programs.

This longitudinal metropolitan approach was continued the following year with another 25 first grade pupils and will include more children and grade levels in ensuing years. Students transferred to the suburban classes (the experimental, or E-group) were compared with a control group which remained in the city and data were collected on academic achievement, attendance records, promotion rates, social growth, and work habits. Test data show that the achievement of the  transferred pupils is at least equal to, if not higher, than would be expected if they had remained in the city school. Promotion rates for the E-group children were high. Most E-group pupils adjusted well and were received by their suburban classmates, as shown by sociometric data.

The Israeli Defense Forces identify and select the candidates, who must be of Sephardic, low socioeconomic status background and have certificates from academic or vocational high schools. The chosen students are soldiers in every sense except that their duty is to study. The candidates are enrolled in an enrichment program which prepares them for the entrance examinations for either the engineering and science program at the Haifa Technion, or for the various universities. The soldiers are discharged from service after they have taken their examinations. The program's success may be noted by the 90-95 percent of the candidates who gained admission to  the Technion or to the universities with competitive admission requirements. The enrichment program seems to have increased the academic achievement of the Technion students but a longer preparatory program seems to be needed for success in science and engineering courses.

In general, the programs sought to raise reading and verbal performance levels, improve performance as measured by achievement tests, and also improve students' attitudes toward school and about themselves. Because of Congressional mandate, some of the funds were specifically earmarked for migrant children, youth in state and local institutions, and mentally ill and mentally retarded children. Findings, based on various measures, show that pupil achievement rate increased, with gains as high as three years. The achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students seems to be narrowing. The  most progress occurred in districts with the most comprehensive program focusing on a few selected goals. The major problems encountered were reduced appropriations and delays in funding, lack of qualified personnel, and misunderstanding about the purposes of Title I. (NH)",

The definition of poverty is derived from the Social Security Administration income index. There are indications that although there has been a general decline in poverty since 1959, approximately one family in eight is still below the poverty level in 1966, and the amount of poverty among Negroes and whites remains significantly different. Gains for families headed by men are greater than for those headed by women, with the samllest relative gains shown by nonwhite female-headed households. Nonwhite families, whatever their size, are far more likely to be poor than white families. The racial differential in earnings is clearcut, regardless of occupation.

The boy had had a number of years of formal schooling without learning any of the basic skills. Neither the academic nor the work training programs at Mobilization for Youth were able to remedy the problem, in part because neither unit recognized the deep-seated perceptual difficulty. Lack of intercommunication between the two programs about the boy's learning failures also hampered a successful outcome. Finally, the vocational counselor terminated all plans for his further education and placed him in a full-time job which did not require literacy in any language. This case study points out the need for  early identification of perceptual handicaps, with referrals to specialists for diagnosis and treatment. Although there are a few agencies which can provide the appropriate help for such dropouts, it is nevertheless important to identify this type of disadvantage so that special programs and treatment methods can be developed.

One of his proposals is for the redistricting of the Hartford schools into semi-autonomous units directed by a district board made up of representatives of the community, professionals, and members of the central board. To improve teacher performance, he outlines a program in which future teachers would work in the schools from the time they enter a teachers college until the time they receive their masters degree; and to make education more relevant to the  needs of disadvantaged students, he encourages the development of work-study programs. Hartford now has plans to construct several new schools at all levels which will allow for individual instruction. It is also part of a regional network established to facilitate greater dissemination of educational research. (EF)",

Specifically, the proposals recommend that schools have a ceiling of 100 pupils with various procedures available to relieve crowding. Class size should be limited to 18 to 22, with a pupil-adult ratio of 12 to 1. Principals should be carefully selected and their functions should be strictly educational, with assistants performing administrative duties. Present staff should be retained and volunteer teachers recruited for one year service in these schools, with the guarantee of transfer without prejudice if necessary. Staff must be closely involved in school  policy formation and must be given up-to-date educational materials and supplies promptly. Other recommendations concern specialized personnel and their relationship with the teaching staff, the special needs and problems posed by the disturbed or educationally handicapped child, community involvement, and school integration. On-going evaluation and provisions for changes are also important. The proposal concludes with a resume of the More Effective Schools program in New York City. (NH)",

School officials were influenced in favor of school desegregation by the negative results of an extensive compensatory education program at a segregated junior high school. The 1965-1966 desegregation plan involved the closing of two predominantly Negro schools and the busing of about 900 elementary and junior high school pupils to integrated schools. Other Syracuse efforts towards educational equality included a special academic program to attract high ability Negro and white students to a formerly Negro elementary school and enriched elementary classes conducted on the Syracuse University  campus. The report discusses the reactions of the Negro and white communities to desegregation, the effects of busing on the school program, the preservation of educational standards, and the leadership role of the school staff. Also discussed are the interracial tensions in the classrooms and the importance of the teacher's preparation for work in desegregated schools.

The school had four terms of two to three months duration each year, and attendance each term averaged about 200 boys and 25 visiting teachers from the same public school systems. The visiting teachers received inservice training in the problems of underachievement. On the basis of demographic and psychodynamic data gathered from its pupils, the school conducted several research studies related to underachievement. In addition, a number of learning programs were &quot;empirically&quot;, &quot;intuitively&quot; developed from the direct interaction between students and teachers. These programs and the approach of the school in general were characterized by&quot;experiential&quot; materials and methods wherein relevance to students' needs and interests figured priminently. The effectiveness of the learning programs was demonstrated in a 1966-67 field testing program involving 6,000 public school students. The report includes brief descriptions of some of the learning programs and of the research studies which were conducted. (LB)",

Each student was given a series of diagnostic tests and then received instruction according to his ability. The students were also divided into four small groups for a program to improve their language arts skills. University student aides were used to provide more individual instruction. Pretesting and posttesting indicated growth in all instructional areas, especially in writing and mathematics; all these gains  were substantially greater than their gains in previous years. The students also demonstrated improved attitudes toward school and self by better attendance and more classroom and extracurricular participation. Recommendations for continued efforts are made.

A proportional sample consisted of ninth grade students in a rural county in Delaware which by 1965 was desegregated through the eighth grade. A composite score was used of the eight Self-Social Symbol Tasks: esteem, dependency, individuation, centrality, complexity, grouping, identification, and power. Identification appears to be the factor yielding the most significant differences among the three groups. Segregated Negroes tend to identify most with significant others, whereas whites identify least. In general, this pattern was also revealed in the analysis of variance of the mother, father, teacher, and friend items of the identification tasks. It is speculated that  the segregated Negroes' identification with significant others reflects a need for social approval. Statistical data are presented in three tables. (NH)",

These students were randomly assigned into two experimental and two control groups. 200 university freshmen from the upper two-thirds of their graduating class were divided into two norm groups. One-half of the students in each of the six groups had composite scores on the standardized entrance examination above the mean for all freshmen entering in 1962. The other half had scores  below the latter mean. Subjects in experimental Group I participated in a special core curriculum program and those in experimental Group II took part in a counseling program, received remedial instructions, and were enrolled in a number of general education courses. Control subjects in Group III had only administrative contact with the program. Various research questions related to the program and its impact are under investigation.

Efforts have been made to change the attitudes of teachers toward their Puerto Rican pupils (e.g. trips to Puerto Rico and seminars to discuss mutual problems), but they have been ineffective; it may be more important to staff schools with Puerto Ricans and to introduce Puerto Rican culture into curriculum and textbooks than to try to change attitudes. It has been shown that Puerto Rican youth receiving bilingual instruction can simultaneously  learn the subject matter in Spanish and acquire skills in the use of English. Also, for parents to help their children, they must be involved in the schools, and liaison, possibly through bilingual mediators, must be established to permit them to express their grievances and problems.

Necessary collaborative dialogue was developed and maintained through the creation and operation of the Woodlawn Community Board, a 21-member group consisting of seven representatives each from the Chicago Public Schools, The Woodlawn Organization, and the University of Chicago. The project staff undertook to answer four questions: (a) What are the critical problems and educational needs in the East Woodlawn community? (b) What new ideas can be generated and implemented in response to the problems and needs? (c) What new ways  of working together need to be established? (d) How can the new institutional relationships and activities be financed? As a result of the study, the Chicago Board of Education established the Woodlawn Experimental District and identified a stream of three schools (K-6, 7-8, 9-12) for initial experimentation. It also recognized the Woodlawn Community Board as the body which will review all activities related to the experiment and make recommendations concerning them to the General Superintendent and the Chicago Board of Education.",

Personal interviews, questionnaires, check lists, and tally sheets were used with teachers, publishing company salesmen, and others to obtain responses to questions such as: (1) How is the American labor movement, its history, contributions, problems, and ambitions, presented in the required textbooks and courses of social studies in public high schools? and (2) Are adequate space and explanation devoted to the legislation regulating labor-management relations at the present time? The conclusion of  the study was that youth are being taught what it meant to be an employee in the crafts or laboring class up to 1935; however, within the limits of this study, they are not being realistically oriented to the contemporary world of work.

Of the 920 unemployed workers interviewed, 200 were relocated an average distance of 300 miles with an average relocation allowance of $194. Some findings were: (1) The relocation effort was aided by financial assistance, (2) The tendency to relocate was greater among young people, (3) The tendency to return after relocation was highest among the very young and the old, (4) Employers were willing to cooperate, and (5) Many factors other than financial assistance influenced the program's  success. Some problems were: (1) Approximately 89 percent of those interviewed had financial reserves of less than $100 which was not enough to tide them over until their first wages were received, (2) Recruiting for Job Corps and Manpower Development and Training Act classes was competitive with the relocation program, and (3) The time was insufficient to train the interviewers adequately. Some suggestions of the relocatees were: (1) Provide more detailed and specific job information, (2) Provide more help in locating housing and getting oriented, (3) Pay assistance money with less delay, and (4) Provide relocatees an opportunity to talk to employers before taking jobs.

Training at a state vocational school was aimed to prepare participants for jobs as airport servicemen, designer-craftsmen, maintenance mechanics, and survey instrumentmen, and counseling was undertaken concurrently with training. Of the 217 enrollees, there were 127 graduates of whom 49 were placed in training-related jobs. Recommendations at the end of this period included a vocational education system of pre-apprenticeship training in the trades, pre-employment  training in business skills, and basic education. During the second phase, November 1965 through June 1966, the services of the earlier period continued, and course offerings changed and expanded significantly. Of the 151 enrollees, there were 97 graduates of whom 31 secured training-related employment. Recommendations were for more effective relationships with employers and labor unions, coordination of government efforts, and use of indigenous instructors in future government programs. (JK)",

A full description of 200 home economics-related occupations as found in the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles&quot; Volume I, and page references which will facilitate the location of descriptions of the &quot;area of work&quot; and &quot;worker trait group&quot; as indicated in Volume II of the Dictionary are presented. Occupations have been classified and alphabetically arranged into one of six clusters: (1) family relationships, (2) clothing and textiles, (3) foods and nutrition, (4) housing and furnishings, (5) clothing maintenance, and (6) household maintenance and services. Home economics-related occupations were identified by independent  analysis of the third edition of the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles,&quot; Volume I. Lists were compared and organized into clusters. Value judgments of 136 knowledgeable persons to the questions: (1) Is the occupation related to the cluster in which it is classified? (2) To what extent is home economics needed for job competence or job training? and (3) What other professional, business, or industrial groups are involved? were the bases for the wide variety listed. Condensed data are available in VT 002 611. A wide variety of occupational classifications, work areas, worker trade groups, and educational requirements are represented. (FP)",

Almost half of the employees had no experience prior to their current jobs. Two of every five employees, but only 11 percent of the professional staff other than nurses, had been in their jobs less than 1 year. The turnover rate was highest for proprietary and least for government facilities. The best attended special courses were those treating  nursing care of the aged and almost as well attended were those on mental or social problems of the aged or chronically ill, physical therapy or rehabilitation, and nutrition or food services. The median weekly salary was $48, ranging from a low of $44 for nurse aides to $87.00 for registered nurses and $89 for other professionals. In general, wages were related to length of work experience. The survey instruments and related information are included. (JK)",

Information obtained included personal and educational characteristics, attitudes and aspirations, characteristics of the farm, labor on the farm, employer-employee relationships, supervision, and opinions with illustrative examples. Some general positive policies and practices resulting in good relationships were: (1) Conscious effort was initiated by the employer to produce mutually satisfactory relationships, (2) Relationships resulted from a combination of policies and practices plus a genuine liking for farm work, (3) Fair  treatment was considered important by employees, (4) Supervision of seasonal labor by owner-operators or by regular employees rather than by crew leaders who recruited and transported the workers resulted in better relationships, and (5) Providing year round employment and fringe benefits resulted in better quality workers. Major difficulties were use of disrespectful language and failure to give sufficiently explicit instructions to employees. Included are case study summaries and a check list on worker-employer relations. (DM)",

During this period, training opportunities under institutional, on-the-job, and combination programs were authorized for over 835,000 persons at a cost of over $1 billion. Training was conducted in all the major occupational groups and in more than 1,300 different occupations. About four-fifths of the graduates surveyed during the first year after training completion reported that they were employed. In response to changing labor market conditions, significant amendments to the Act were passed by Congress in 1963, 1965, and 1966, making it a dynamic and flexible statute to serve the Nation's ever-changing manpower profile.  Manpower training presently focuses on the two major problems or emerging skill shortages in the economy and the serious employment problems of the disadvantaged, with about two-thirds of the program effort being directed toward the latter problem. The present program emphasis will continue along with some new activities such as training for the part-time employed and for prison inmates, both results of the 1966 amendments to the Act. (ET)",

Its agenda was established following field visits to a dozen youth-work programs of community action agencies in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. There was considerable discussion of the comparatively meagre resources allocated to the communities for planning work program activities. There was general agreement as to the urgency for much fuller information about the target population. It was maintained that disadvantaged youth require a range of services that includes work  evaluation, prevocational work experience, vocational skill training, job placement, and supportive services, which should become the components of a comprehensive program. The one problem of recruitment which concerned every program was the achievement of a balanced group recruited, selected, and enrolled. The overriding problem was expressed as the danger of the recruitment effort's producing a group all of one ethnic background. The issues raised by newly promulgated family income criteria for enrollment of youth, problems of validating income, and provisions for youth program rejectees were discussed. (PS)",

Flexibility of the labor force has decreased because of the lack of low skill jobs and the increased employment of women and minority groups. Oregon's research efforts, prompted by need for data by public and private sectors, was directed at ways of obtaining data for educational planning. The central question was one of obtaining maximum return from education's efforts in preparing persons for work and was based on the presumption that public education cannot do it alone. In order to determine the occupations which should receive priority in resource relocation for training programs, three techniques were explored and demonstrated. These were questionnaires, projections by regression  techniques, and interindustry analysis and projection (input-output analysis). All three were considered to be supplemental to other available information and subordinate to final analysis by professional and lay policy makers. Interindustry analysis and projection was considered by the researchers to be the most useful technique, but dependence on the others was also necessary. Demonstration of the techniques was with national and Oregon data and considered a necessary step to utilization. (JM)",
