The specific objectives of the research were to: (1) identify the fringe benefits provided school teachers in the 12 Southeastern Regional Council member States; (2) calculate the approximate dollar value of each of the major fringe benefits and present as individual and total annual wage equivalents; (3) identify the extent to which fringe benefits vary by type and amount within the region; (4) examine carefully, theoretically and empirically, the question of whether free time in the summers is a benefit or detriment to teachers,  and attempt to place a value on this leisure time; (5) compare teacher fringe benefits and total compensation in the Southeast with other occupations in industries and nationwide; and (6) make policy recommendations concerning fringe benefits as a part of teacher compensation packages in the Southeast.

        "description":"This paper describes the elements that most clearly identify and are most critical to a mastery learning program. Ways in which teachers can easily and efficiently implement these elements in their teaching and practices are outlined, along with procedures for evaluating their effectiveness in improving student learning. A discussion is presented on the elements most basic and crucial to the mastery learning process. These elements consist of feedback, correctives and enrichment activities, coupled with congruence with specific learning criteria and the procedures used to evaluate learning. Implications for the implementation of mastery learning are discussed: (1) mastery learning can be very broadly applied; (2) teachers need not dramatically change what they are doing in their  classrooms or the way they teach to use mastery learning; (3) mastery learning has a positive effect on most student achievement; and (4) more students can experience learning success.

        "description":"This paper presents a model describing three context variables hypothesized to affect measures of teacher efficacy. These variables include the nature of the student performance outcome (positive or negative), the ability of the students involved (high or low), and the scope of influence (single student or group of students). The results from studies investigating the influence of performance outcomes and student ability on teachers' perceptions of efficacy are summarized. The present study explored the extent of the effect of influence on the teachers' perceptions. It was discovered that teachers do distinguish in their perceptions of efficacy between results with a single student and those with a group of students. When poor performance was involved, teachers expressed less  personal responsibility and efficacy for single students than for results from a group of students.

The subjects were comprised of three groups of students (N-581) at three stages of their teacher preparation: beginning their first required education course, just prior to student teaching, and at the end of student teaching. There were significant changes in anxiety, concern, attitude, and confidence about teaching; however, these changes did not follow a consistent pattern for each measure or for all sample subgroups. Changes in anxiety and confidence about teaching moved in a consistently positive direction; attitude towards teaching  showed no overall change; and concerns about teaching increased prior to student teaching but decreased following student teaching. The student characteristics of anticipated grade level of teaching, gender, teaching field, time of decision to become a teacher, and father's educational level were found to be related to one or more of the criterion measures.

        "description":"A report is given of a series of qualitative studies conducted to clarify the market patterns of career choice and expectation, recruitment and selection, turnover and mobility, and working conditions and career alternatives of public school teachers. A study of the career expectations of noneducation college students was also made. These studies sought to delineate the dynamics undergirding the market forces so that policy makers may have a more effective framework for analyzing and remedying the problems confronting the occupation of teaching. Focus was upon: (1) labor market variables affecting present education students and teachers; (2) the mobility patterns of resigning teachers; and (3) the variables affecting the career choices of noneducation college students in  high-demand fields. Over 525 teachers, former teachers, and administrators in school systems and education students, noneducation students, professors, and administrators in universities representing 22 institutions in rural and urban sites in three different southeastern states were interviewed or surveyed.

Data was analyzed using the variables of education, work experience, sex, race, marital status, weeks worked annually, hours worked weekly, urban or nonurban residence, and college degree holder status. Bases of comparison through a range of earning alternatives included: characteristics of the existing teacher work force, characteristics of the general nonteacher work force, and characteristics of the white male college-educated work force. Findings indicated that current teacher salaries are below alternative earning opportunities in other occupations by $6,718 for persons with the same  sociodemographic characteristics as present teachers. When compared with nonteaching college-educated workers with the same sociodemographic characteristics, the figure was $10,268 less.

        "description":"This report is about the problem of making transition or enrollment rate gains comparable. It is shown that measures based on the proportions themselves, i.e. the difference between proportions, the proportion ratio and the residual gain ratio do not make the gains comparable. Instead a non-linear transformation has to be done. Two such transformations are discussed: probits and logits. As shown in the report they both make the transition gains comparable. However, it is important not to base the conclusions on the transformed values directly, since they are very difficult to interpret. Instead the transformed values should be used to predict transition rates on the assumption of comparable gains. After that the observed gains are compared with the predicted ones. A problem, more  important than the choice of transformation, is that of sampling error. Comparing transition rate gains means a comparison between differences and in this case the sampling error is greater than when studying mere differences. Therefore, a statistical test is appropriate when studying transition rate gains, since it provides a measure of the effect of the independent variable at the same time as it provides a statistical test of whether this effect has been changed or not.

California Achievement Test scores were obtained for 598 fifth grade students in reading, language arts, spelling, and mathematics. Achievement gain scores were used to examine differences between males and females, Hispanics and Whites, and students taught by user versus non-user teachers. Results confirmed the achievement gains expected in one years' time. Males had much higher gains in  reading, and females in spelling. Caucasians had significantly higher gains in mathematics and reading achievement than Hispanics did. In all subjects, Hispanics started with lower test scores and posted smaller gains than Caucasians. Results suggested that the benefits of use of the innovation were not fully accrued during the first year. Non-users showed slightly above average gains in language arts and mathematics, while users showed slightly above average gains in reading and spelling. (GDC)",

        "description":"This study examined the psychometric characteristics of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) administered under special conditions for nine handicapped groups. Four psychometric characteristics were studied: level of test performance, test reliability, speededness, and extent of unexpected differential item performance. Psychometric comparisons were made between a non-handicapped sample and each of nine different handicapped classifications. These contrasts were replicated across two forms of the same test, serving to increase confidence in the stability of results and their applicability to other SAT forms. With the exception of performance level, the psychometric characteristics of the SAT were generally comparable for the handicapped and nondisabled groups studied. It is  concluded that this result should extend to other forms of the SAT and other disabled students to the extent that these groups and forms, and the conditions under which they are administered, are similar to those employed in this study. That the psychometric characteristics of the test are similar across populations provides evidence necessary to support SAT scores as accurate and fair indicators of the developed scholastic abilities of disabled students.

        "description":"Reading test data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) were scaled using the unidimensional item response theory model. Data were collected for students aged 9, 13, and 17. To determine whether the responses to the reading items were consistent with unidimensionality, four different methods were applied: (1) principal component analysis of phi and tetrachoric correlation matrices; (2) principal component analysis of the image correlation matrix, a method based on the work of Guttman; (3) R. D. Bock's full-information factor analysis; and (4) P. R. Rosenbaum's test of unidimensionality, monotonicity, and conditional independence. Balanced incomplete block (BIB) spiralling was used with this year's NAEP to assign test items to booklets. This permitted the  estimation of inter-item correlations, but resulted in an unusual pattern of missing data. Results from the analyses conducted for each age group were different from the analysis of the 25 items administered in all three samples. It was concluded that it was not unreasonable to regard the reading items as measures of a single dimension of reading proficiency. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"The content of textbooks teaching the use of a computer was studied. An important component of skill learning, choosing the right procedure at the right time, is difficult in computer education because the connection between real-world goals and the generic procedures described in a manual is often obscure. Furthermore, it is difficult to tell which of several similar procedures is best for a particular situation. Various types of advice about choosing the correct procedure were investigated. College students and staff members read one of four versions of a manual for a computer game called &quot;Box World.&quot; A Dandylion computer was used. Three versions contained advice about when to use particular game procedures. The advice was either stated as a simple verbal rule or elaborated  with a concept example or a task example. The fourth version contained no advice. Subjects then performed three tasks: recall; recognition of correct versus incorrect applications of the advice; and decision making and problem solving. Subjects who received advice followed it to select a procedure; however, so did subjects receiving no advice. The examples helped subjects identify correct applications of the advice, but did not increase adherence to the advice during problem solving. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"A self-administering test of oral language fluency was developed for use with high school teachers of French and Spanish. Interviews were also conducted, and biographical data were collected. The original instrument was based on the Foreign Language Questionnaire Pretest developed for the Survey of Global Understanding Project. The focus of the new test was entirely on listening and speaking. It was pilot tested with 24 high school language teachers from five New Jersey schools, who taught French, Spanish, or both. The field study was conducted nationally, using 200 teachers. The questionnaire, which included questions asking for biographical information about foreign language experience, and the Language Proficiency Interview were completed. Correlations between interviews and  questionnaire items supported the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Based on this finding, it was revised and used in the national survey without the more costly interview. Questionnaires were mailed to a national sample of teachers. Over 92 percent, or 878 teachers, responded. The self-ratings were accurate and highly correlated with native language, travel experience, and opportunity to speak the language at home. Extensive appendices include the Language Proficiency Interview, the Self Assessment of Oral Language Proficiency Survey, National Language Teachers' Survey, interviewers' instructions, and a printout showing intercorrelations of ratings and personal characteristics.

        "description":"This paper outlines the components of initial cognitive skill acquisition and analyses features of elaborations in the instructional materials that can facilitate each component. Three basic components of skill learning are identified: (1) learning novel concepts and the functionality of novel concepts and procedures; (2) learning how to execute the procedures; and (3) learning the conditions under which the procedures can and should be applied. Three types of elaborations are analyzed in terms of the requirements of these components: analogies, simple instantiations, and situation examples. Situation examples are held to be the most useful type of elaboration for skill learning because each example can contribute to learning in all three components. On the other hand, while  analogies can be constructed to illustrate each component, they are more likely to help people learn the functionality of a procedure than how to execute it or when to select it. However, since learners tend to rely on examples as models, it is important to choose examples with care and to provide enough examples to illustrate the range of application of a rule or procedure. Otherwise, learners, may interpret a rule incorrectly or make spurious assumptions about the conditions under which it applies. (Author/PN)",

Subjects (from the areas of geography, educational psychology, and sociology) were 13 university faculty members in experiment one and 12 undergraduate students in experiment two. Following a practice trial, the learning of a logical map and a non-logical map was compared. Cognitive processes used in learning the maps were also examined. Procedure was identical for both experiments with the exception that experiment two subjects were asked to recall the two maps after a 24-hour period. Subjects' maps were scored by two raters for correct labels and for correct spatial placement of features. A content analysis of the sessions determined the cognitive strategies used to learn the  maps. A three-way analysis of variance for map recall was conducted, with discipline as a between-subjects variable, and map and trial as within-subjects variables. In both experiments, the logic or non-logic of the maps affected only the experts. It is concluded that knowledge of principles of spatial organization must be considered as an integral factor in the map learning process. (PN)",

Subjects were random samples of 303 English preadolescents and 303 Australians that were matched in terms of age and sex. In the first set of analyses, CFA demonstrated that an a priori factor structure of self-concept fitted responses by English and by Australian students, and that the factor structure was reasonably invariant across the two groups. In the second set of analyses CFA demonstrated that English and Australian students differed significantly on only one of eight self-concept factors, and that all sex differences in  the multidimensional self-concepts were similar for English and Australian students. The results of the study provide further evidence of the generality of multidimensional self-concepts as inferred by the Self Description Questionnaire, and demonstrate recent advances in the application of CFA.

Reports on the results of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) were reviewed from 1975 through 1985 for fifth grades, the only elementary grade level tested districtwide. Mean percentiles for Total Reading, Total Language and Total Mathematics for each school were determined, transformed into scaled scores, and used to calculate weighted means. Time series designs using unit replications were used to determine the effect of the intervention of AGP in each content area. California  Assessment Program data were used to examine AGP effects on achievement. Data from the district's Pupil Ethnic Census Reports addressed the possibility of a &quot;history effect&quot; in the time series design. School effectiveness factors were compared to the AGP instructional model; 11 of the 16 factors were found to be systematically incorporated. This finding shows that school effectiveness factors can be systematically written into curricula and materials used in schools. (PN)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to discuss the reasons for resistance to evaluation and the factors that affect adoption of new procedures, while focusing on a model for guiding the planning of evaluation implementation strategies. The process of adoption of an innovation occurs in three stages: orientation, where the user identifies benefits; initiation, where the user gives an innovation a trial; and integration, where it becomes part of routine practice. At each stage in the adoption, different strategies can be directed to gain the cooperation of either the user of the evaluation or the organization: (1) power; (2) communication; (3) consultation; (4) reinforcement; (5) training ; and (6) direct measures. The strategies differ depending upon the time frame in which they are  applied. That is, different operations are required prior to commencement, during the initiation of the evaluation, and when evaluation procedures are to be integrated into routine organizational activities. It is concluded that: (1) in planning the implementation of evaluation, the implications are that implementation strategies should persuade rather than enforce cooperation; (2) cognitive and perceptual changes must be accompanied by behavioral changes; and (3) different management practices will be applicable at different time intervals in the evaluation procedure.

        "description":"A computerized flexilevel test was implemented and its ability estimates were compared with those of a Bayesian estimation based computerized adaptive test (CAT) as well as with known true ability estimates. Results showed that when the flexilevel test was terminated according to Lord's criterion, its ability estimates were highly and significantly correlated with those of the Bayesian based CAT and with the known true thetas. Matched t-tests between the flexilevel and the Bayesian CAT and with the known true thetas were not significantly different from one another. The primary implication of this study is that it is feasible to implement a computerized adaptive test without having to create a calibrated item pool containing 200 or more items, as is the case with Item Response  Theory (IRT) based CAT systems. Neither the software nor the hardware needed for flexilevel CAT methods present the rather serious obstacles that they often do for IRT-based CAT. This fact and the result that flexilevel CAT ability estimates compare favorably with the IRT-based CAT ability estimates indicate that, for the first time, CAT procedures can be made practical and feasible for ordinary classroom testing.

The evaluations are described in four phases: (1) from a nadir of low quality, utility and precision (1966-1974); (2) to a transition point (1974-1978); (3) to a point of high quality, utility and technical rigor with the implementation of the Title I Evaluation and Reporting System (1978-1981); (4) to a relaxation of standards and quality given the revised requirements of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (1981 to the present). Informal agreement among evaluators and program managers indicates that the quality of Chapter I evaluations is on the  decline. Evaluation systems must be applied uniformly across the states if comparable data are to be collected and analyzed. At present, Federal agencies are not requiring that uniform data be collected on the 1981 block grants. The availability of an authoritative future source of national information about: (1) the nature of program operations; (2) the levels and types of service available; and (3) the effect of programs on the problems they are intended to address remains in doubt.

The student questionnaire is based on an evaluation form from an American Educational Research Association workshop, Scriven's checklist and EO-CRDG experiences. The one page form includes Likert-type items on course (or class) organization, pace, difficulty, and opportunities to interact or ask questions. Three open-ended  questions cover strengths, weaknesses, and other comments. Students assign a letter grade (A-F) to the course. The observation form used is a modified version of the Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development. It includes engagement time, active teaching behaviors, student and teacher field notes, and teacher time allocation. Using the State's performance expectations for major subject matter areas, cognitive tests were constructed. For greater efficiency, final reports would include writings that had proven to be successful in communicating in the past. The three generic instruments developed in this study are appended. (PN)",

        "description":"The sampling of teachers for nationwide surveys offers a challenging endeavor in obtaining a representative and adequate sample to truly represent opinions of the teachers. Ten national surveys of public school teachers conducted between 1980 and 1985 are presented with respect to their sampling design and procedures. Concepts and theoretical considerations provide the background of the critical review. This paper discusses adequacy and representativeness as criteria of a good sample, sample design, bias, sampling error, sampling frame and unit, multistage and stratified sampling, and sample size allocation. Problems associated with prevailing sampling practices include: (1) lack of sampling frame or list of all public school teachers from which a sample may be drawn; (2) the  question of assurance that the sample drawn is representative of the target population of public school teachers; (3) the theoretical connection between a sample design and the computation of estimates from the results; (4) the recognition and knowledge of the quantitative relationship between the sample design and the precision of estimates; and (5) reporting results that demonstrate validity, and willingness and ability to sort out the strengths and weaknesses of the survey. Solutions to these interrelated problems are discussed. (PN)",

        "description":"The student performance standards of excellence in mathematics, science, social studies, and writing for Florida schools were developed cooperatively by the Florida Department of Education, local school district personnel and representatives of institutions of higher education. These standards and skills were reviewed by teachers and supervisors throughout the state. A second revision was sent to superintendents in each district for review by appropriate persons with subject area expertise. Input from reviews was used to prepare the final document for State Board of Education approval. The standards represent general and higher-level competencies at grades 3, 5, 8, and 12. Written in broad general terms, the standards are intended to communicate with the general public. The skill  statements provide teachers and curriculum specialists with more specific information concerning the performance expected of high-achieving students at specific grade levels. These skills will form the basis for a state assessment program in each of the areas of mathematics, science, social studies and writing. Tables summarize the number of applicable standards and skills for each grade level. A listing by subject area of standards and skills and the grade levels to which they apply, comprises the balance of the document. Upon the authority of the Educational Reform Act of 1983 the Florida State Board of Education approved these standards of excellence on September 20, 1983 and required each district school board to adopt by July 1, 1984, rules which provide for appropriate instruction  based upon these standards.

Student promotion rates in these grades between 1980 and 1985 were examined. Results showed that, in all four grades, the percentage of students retained to repeat the grade increased slightly. The BST was the main, but not the only criterion for retaining students. Student attendance in remedial summer programs did not appear to affect promotion decisions. In fact, among students who qualified for the compensatory program, promotion rates were higher among those who did not attend summer school than among those who did. It was also found that the BST was able to identify a small group of students who had continuing difficulties in meeting the minimum standards.  The percentage of students who failed to meet the minimum standards and who had previously received remedial services increased each year. In grade 2 in 1985, it was 6 percent; in grade 3, 17 percent; and grade 4 or 5, 27 percent. Accordingly, it was suggested that alternative programs were needed to meet these students' needs.

Language arts and mathematics tests were administered in grades 2 through 5. Scores increased slightly between 1982 and 1984, and declined in 1985; therefore the number of students qualifying for the Compensatory/Remedial Program also changed. The BST played a limited role in decisions to promote or retain students. Of students who failed the grade 2 BST, 25 percent were never retained during the next four years, 66 percent were retained once, and 9 percent were retained twice. About half failed the BST two or more times in four years. It was concluded that the combination of  retention and remediation did more to alleviate basic skills deficiencies than did either retention or remediation alone. This combination was most effective early in the student's educational career. Recommendations concerning the provision of remedial services are included. (GDC)",

A class in naturalistic inquiry methods was offered to practicing teachers and other graduate students during a 15-week semester. During the first two or three weeks, students read extensively about qualitative methods and identified a possible site to conduct a study. The remainder of the course included conducting the studies, discussing the experiences in weekly class meetings and writing a final report. The teacher/researcher observed one student's work/study habits and interactions with teacher/researcher and peers daily for over three months. A videotape camera recorded the student's behavior during ten hours of classroom activities. Field notes were made based on the tapes and recalled details. Repeated  interviews, formal and informal, were conducted with the student, his peers, principal, parents and school guidance counselor. The teacher/researcher maintained a detailed set of field notes, a log of observations, a record of interview results and teacher attitudes, and evolving analyses of the data. Two questionnaires provided sociograms and information on the student's life, family and attitudes. The paper then describes the study process, identifies difficulties and benefits encountered, summarizes activities taking place since the study, and suggests implications for other teachers and settings.

It is the behavior or intent of the human being that is clearly a matter of ethical concern. Like numerology and the sects of inumerates and qualitatives, there is not so much an unethical practice that is supported as there is a lack of vision and concern for other points of view. The qualitative and quantitative researchers have made it difficult to live in both their worlds even though there are no necessary contradictions between them. The quantifiers at the very least could have provided data to determine if students were attaining, or were even aware of, aesthetic values and ethical norms. If quantifiers detract students from a love of beauty or from a knowledge of ethical and  unethical behavior, then quantifiers are failing their responsibilities, and their behaviors are examples of ethics gone wrong. Examples are given of scientism, a pseudoscientific belief that accepts the appearance and apparent successes of science without its essence, including a willingness to reexamine data, hypotheses, and theories when the evidence so suggests. Selected examples are presented regarding educational rationalizations that hinder understanding and free inquiry. (PN)",

The predictive validity of the SPRT was empirically investigated with two different and relatively large item pools with heterogeneous item parameters. Graduate students in a course on computer assisted instruction were administered tests on the Dimension Authoring Language and the COM Test, which measured knowledge of how computers functionally work. It was contended that, if the SPRT were used conservatively, it would remain robust as a decision model. Overall agreement coefficients ranged from .84 to .98, depending on the method of determining mastery status on the total test. The  Neyman-Pearson classical approach to hypothesis testing was also included. The expected agreement was .95. An average of about 20 test items were required to reach SPRT mastery decisions, reducing testing time by 75 to 80 percent. (GDC)",

The overall purposes of the field tests were to evaluate questionnaires and procedures to be used for the full-scale surveys scheduled for 1986. Both the NLS-72 and the HSB questionnaires were reviewed for item nonresponse for all items with four percent or more missing data. Both questionnaires included a large number of skip patterns. Empirical results concerning response rates to skip patterns were discussed and special problems requiring revision were analyzed. A calendar format was tested to offer an effective way of capturing periods of  interrupted schooling and employment, reducing the size of the main survey data file without compromising data quality. The effectiveness of new and revised HSB and NLS-72 items were evaluated by frequency distributions and evaluators' observations. The current follow-up surveys of HSB and NLS-72 were conducted primarily by mail. However, locating for the NLS-72 field test was done by telephone. In addition, a separate questionnaire, the Teaching Supplement was developed for a subset of the NLS-72 sample. (PN)",

Three topics are discussed in question-answer form. (1) Will standardized testing dictate the curriculum in the future? An analysis of major curriculum change indicates two changes in the past 25 years: a revolution within particular content areas (e.g., mathematics and linguistics) and a narrowing of the curriculum to basic skills. Standardized tests seem to exercise little influence upon these types of major curricula change. Inferences from historical patterns indicate that testing will exercise little influence on the curriculum in the future. (2) Will test coverage provide a better match for the curriculum in the future? While the present  curriculum-test content match is believed to be quite good, it is hoped that conclusions drawn from present studies will lead to developments in the theory of content validity for multi-level achievement batteries. (3) Will recent developments in testing methodology influence the test-curriculum match? Developments in Item Response Theory and Latent Trait Methodology have been shifting interest from curriculum-test content match to trait methodology. The inevitable result of tipping the balance in favor of a trait methodology will be to attenuate the strict fit between curriculum content and test content. (PN)",

Attention is also given to seven action areas identified by the Task  Force which would address these problems. The remaining portions of this paper discuss challenges faced by professional psychologists in converting research knowledge into improved school testing practices, specifically, improving the assessment and analysis of student's learning abilities and language skills through dynamic assessment of cognitive skills and assessment of communicative competence. Attention is called to improving and updating the scientific knowledge-base of professional psychologists, improving schools' capabilities to monitor and manage implementation of innovative testing practices, and to fostering collaborative relationships between school psychologists and academic researchers on testing innovations.

The PRO-S/E, used in over 20 school districts in six states, is a diagnostic system school districts use to determine strengths and weaknesses based on 11 characteristics of effective schools. Data is collected by PRO-S/E administrators using: (1) district data forms; (2) superintendent interviews; (3) school data forms; (4) principal interviews; (5) school rating forms; (6) teacher questionnaires; (7) student questionnaires; and (8) optional forms to study schools' achievement test scores and students' socioeconomic status. Data from the school rating form and the teacher and student questionnaires develop graphic comparison profiles for  the 11 characteristics. Analyzed results are used in addition to the interview and descriptive information to develop a written comprehensive profile of the school district. The validation study resulted in the broadening of the definition of one variable category, &quot;Roles and Responsibilities&quot;; the reassignment to other variable categories of three items for both the student and teacher survey; and the rewarding of five items in the student survey and five items in the teacher survey.

This paper then focuses on the experience of 11 program faculties at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville), that developed and used exit exams for majors as one component of a comprehensive program evaluation process. The purpose for test development is discussed, as well as test development procedures: (1) faculty involvement; (2) initial steps; (3) item types; (4) test length; (5) consultants; and (6) test revisions. The preparation of students, test administration and scoring are described, as is the post-administration evaluation of the tests through student reaction,  faculty reaction, item analysis, test revision, and test security. The use of test results, future test use, and faculty reaction to the test development process are presented. Faculty involvement in the test development and a review of students' performance stimulated a variety of improvements, including increases in curricular structure, more consistency among faculty teaching core courses, stronger linkages between lower- and upper-division coursework, and more opportunities for students to apply knowledge learned in classes.

Data were available for 155 of the 500 school districts from the 1985 Educational Quality Assessment administration. A norm sample included 111 high schools, 138 junior high schools and 361 elementary schools. Students were tested in grades 5, 8, and 11. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between teacher perceptions of school effectiveness variables and student achievement as well as student attitudes. Teacher perceptions of school effectiveness variables were found to have a statistically significant link with most of the student achievement measures. Rather low  correlations, which in many cases were not statistically significant, were found between teacher perceptions of school effectiveness variables and student attitudes. Teacher perceptions of school effectiveness variables (when used with other school and student variables) were not the best predictors of student achievement in multiple regression.

Following a literature search, national and statewide surveys of reporting practices and information needs were conducted by Measurement Incorporated. Common and unique needs of district and building administrators, teachers and counselors, and parents and students were found. Using the nationwide search results, the information needs of students, parents, teachers,  guidance counselors, principals, and district administrators in Maryland were surveyed. Score report design was based upon these studies emphasizing the accountability function of the tests. Four levels of reporting and seven content areas necessitated 28 separate score reports. Examples of four levels of reports (student, class, school, and local education agency) are presented. Each report is oriented to a specific audience, visual clutter is reduced, and diagnostic information is briefly presented. A user's guide provides thorough background on score interpretation at multiple levels. This score reporting system appears to meet the responsibilities and information needs of all its audiences.

One purpose is to compare the item parameter estimates produced by various procedures available in BILOG. Four different models are used: the one, two, and three parameter model and a three parameter model with common guessing parameters. The results generally indicate that the various item parameter estimation procedures tend to yield similar results. The major exception concerned the Bayesian and maximum likelihood procedures (MLP) applied to the three parameter model. The MLP has a tendency to produce more extreme estimates than the Bayesian procedure. A second purpose is to compare the ability estimates produced by the available procedures: maximum likelihood, expected  a'posteriori, and maximum a'posteriori. The results indicated that: (1) robustification is not a strong effect on the mean or standard deviation of the ability estimates; (2) the mean and variance of the ability estimates are not strongly effected by the type of item parameter estimates used in calculating ability estimates; and (3) the effect of ability estimation procedure is fairly strong on the ability estimates.

This paper outlines the process that CCSD followed in the development of math and language arts tests for grades one through eight and area exams for required high school courses. The test development process begins with a statement of instruction or an objective. Methods for making objectives testable include revision, creation of new objectives, or grouping objectives into domains. The test purpose and feedback desired should be a guide in making objectives testable. Blueprinting refers to outlining the content to be tested and requires the developer to decide which objectives to test and the number of items  needed to test each objective. Test and item specifications provide guidelines for writing items for a given objective. Objectives identification and specifications development provide the foundation for item construction. The pilot test tries out items and administration procedures, obtains empirical data for item evaluation and test form composition, and obtains performance data from students. Decisions to eliminate or retain items for future test forms depend upon the analysis of test data and the preference of the instructional staff. (PN)",

This paper (1) describes the various approaches to implementing Chapter 1 program improvement activities at the state and local district levels in 13 western states through the provision of technical assistance by an outside agency; (2) categorizes these approaches in terms of essential ingredients for fostering change in education; and (3) discusses implications of the findings for future work in program improvement. During 1982-85, the Region 4 Technical Assistance Center (TAC) provided over 300 workshops and consultations on program improvement topics alone. A majority of the program  improvement activities are found in the opportunistic or pragmatic category. This implies that understanding of and expectations for program improvement in Chapter 1 should be moderated in the face of reality constraints, that many of the school improvement models currently in use may need to be adapted or tailored to accommodate assumptions inherent in the improvement package, and that TAC staff should take advantage of the diversity of approaches being initiated to afford flexibility in promoting incremental improvements in Chapter 1 projects.

        "description":"This paper details the development of the high school general mathematics examination and reading comprehension tests for grades one through eight for the curriculum referenced testing program in Charleston County School District, South Carolina. While the basic developmental approach was similar, problems encountered in developing the two types of tests were unique and inspired different strategies to accommodate the differences in the curricula. Begun in 1983 development of the ninth grade mathematics examination involved identifying objectives and writing item specifications, followed by four cycles of item writing, test production, and pilot-testing. Curriculum changes by the North Office in 1983 necessitated recalibrating 468 items. After pilot testing a second set of test  forms in 1984, a consulting firm recalibrated the item bank, created four test forms and projected student performance. The first official examination administration was postponed until 1986 and the 1985 administration became a field test. The examination will account for 50 percent of the final course grade. The test development process goal for reading comprehension was to generate formative and summative tests to assess curricular objectives for grades one through eight. Outside consultants assisted in identifying reading comprehension objectives due to the different organization of existing elementary and middle school objectives. Outside contractors were also used to develop test specifications and to train district teachers in writing the test items. Item review and revision by  district staff took longer than anticipated, so a language arts content expert completed the item review and prepared the 60 pilot test forms. Pilot testing was postponed until the spring of 1986. (BS)",

One method emerged as having the best all around performance. This method used repeated T-squared statistics and removed the variable with maximum significant F statistic, providing a good balance between power and Type 1 errors. It consisted of  the following steps: (1) MANOVA on p variables followed by ANOVAs; (2) reject the hypothesis for the variable with the largest significant F statistic and remove that variable; (3) MANOVA on p-1 variables; (4) repeat Step 2 with p-1 variables; (5) MANOVA on p-2 variables...and so on until no MANOVAs are significant, no ANOVAs are significant, or there are no variables left.

Parallels are drawn between the &quot;healthy&quot; black family and a common memory of historical and cultural values. Current problems confronting the black family are described including a change in the roles and potency of black social institutions, reduced control of black families over the socialization process of black children, and effects of popular media on the socialization of  blacks. A greater institutional role is advocated to enhance black awareness and understanding of black culture and history: social institutions must combine resources and provide vehicles to communicate values, beliefs, ideas and history to blacks, and institutions must be developed to promote black economic development.

        "author":["August, Lynn Kao"],
        "description":"This study examines the patterns of health service use among Rhode Island's Southeast Asian refugees, using Medicaid/Refugee Medical Assistance data. It was found that this group has a lower rate of health service utilization than the general Rhode Island population. Following the 3-month initial resettlement period during which mandatory health screening occurs, the use of health services begins to decrease. The types of services most used by refugees are outpatient services, and the most used ambulatory care facilities are the community health centers; hospital admissions and emergency room visits are not common. These findings suggest that the health care needs of Southeast Asian refugees are compatible with the health care principles of HMOs. However, the group's high usage  of community health centers and the successful and long-standing experience these centers have had with the refugees indicate that they are a very appropriate means of health care delivery for Southeast Asian refugees. Based on this evidence, it is suggested that a Community Health Center-Primary Care Network model would be the best option for improving refugee medical assistance/service delivery. Low health service use rates also imply a low demand for health services, which indicates that the refugees' need for third-party coverage stems chiefly from the fear of catastrophic medical expenses rather than from actual use of services as a result of on-going illnesses. Extensive tables and charts are included at the end of the report. (CG)",

        "description":"This report reviews existing research on the labor force participation and employment of Southeast Asian refugees, in the context of an apparent paradox between reports of positive labor force participation and high rates of public assistance usage by refugees. Following an introduction, Part II reviews the available evidence on general labor force activities of Southeast Asian refugees as compared with the general U.S. population. Part III focuses on factors which seem most influential in predicting who enters the labor force, including age, sex, foreign education, knowledge of English upon arrival, and timing of arrival in the United States. Parts IV and V consider whether the type of sponsorship which a refugee is assisted influences labor force activity, and analyse refugee  ethnic differences and how they affect labor force participation. Section VI examines the methods used by refugees to search for and secure jobs. Section VII describes what kinds of jobs they find and what job conditions are like for them, and also comments on their involvement in the &quot;underground economy.&quot; It is concluded that the high rate of welfare participation does not appear to be a result of lack of motivation to work, but rather of the refugees' difficulty in obtaining adequately remunerative work.

The first section of this final report presents the project rationale and discusses the status of the region's &quot;small cities&quot; and research on educational change and school effectiveness. The next section describes the project goals. The role played by professional and civic associations as collaborators in school improvement is discussed next, and the effects and impact of the project on the associations, school districts and  participating schools are then described. The final section concludes that associations make important contributions to school improvement by: increasing participation activities; improving the utilization quality of R &amp; D information and products; identifying opportunities for successful implementation of projects; providing training, technical assistance, and follow-up support; and contributing to a climate of acceptance and cooperation. Critical characteristics of associations and their relationship to involvement in improvement activities are explored. Finally, implications of the &quot;natural channels&quot; approach for State and local policymakers are examined. Appendix A lists the cooperating organizations. Appendix B lists Urban Development products and publications. (CG)",

The communities that participated were in New Mexico, California, and Florida. One section discusses characteristics of the Hispanic youth unemployment problems, with a history of Hispanics in the United States, demographics on the group, and the various barriers to employment. Another covers the general concept of public and private partnerships with  specific reference to the Jobs Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Each of the six successful communities' programs are described, including information on funding, innovative approaches, problems, and points which were especially successful and which could be transferred to other communities. Finally, the peer matching component of the program in which two successful programs were matched with two communities wanting to initiate similar projects is described.

Ninety-four students were enrolled: 73.4% were 18 or 19 years old; 73.0% were women; 90.4% were single; 47.9% also spoke a language other than English. Prospective students took the CUNY skills assessment tests in reading, writing, and mathematics in the spring. Seven students were enrolled in reading, 26 in writing, and 65 in mathematics. Student performance was assessed by skills assessment posttests and teacher's observation. Findings showed that 98.9% of the students completed the program. Reading and mathematics students showed  improved performance on CUNY skills assessment tests. Class performance did not necessarily predict test performance. Improvement in writing was not apparent in test scores. Most students remained at the same course level. Attendance across classes was inconsistent. Lower attendance in the morning classes and writing classes may have affected learning outcomes. The program was generally well implemented but additional pre-planning and administrative and clerical support before start of classes might alleviate specific problems. Recommendations for future research are given. Tables and appendices provide student and curricular data. (CG)",

        "description":"In 1984, 94 college freshmen attended the SEEK Prefreshman Summer Program at Baruch College in the city of New York. This program, held for six weeks during the summer prior to college, provided skills remediation, counseling, and financial aid to freshmen from educationally and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Its goal was to improve students' academic and coping skills in order to increase their chances of success in college. A study was conducted to compare the first-year enrollment and academic outcomes of incoming SEEK freshmen who participated in the program with incoming freshmen who did not participate. The investigator found that: (1) SEEK freshmen were demographically distinct: the program served proportionately more females and blacks, and fewer Asians. (2) The  program participants, most of whom came from vocational high schools, required assistance in mathematics. Otherwise, their academic preparation was similar to non-participants. (3) Program participants who advanced after completing a summer remedial course continued to show adequate overall academic performance during their first semester. (4) Participants' academic performance in their first two semesters did not differ greatly from that of non-participants. Prior academic preparation was more important than program participation in determining first-year outcomes. (5) Proportionately fewer program participants than non-participants re-enrolled in the second semester. (6) Participants who did not re-enroll were more likely to leave on an official basis, such as transferring to another  institution. (Author/KH)",

An education for employment component of the Summer Youth Employment Program, Project ALERT represents a concentrated effort to address problems that have contributed to the high unemployment rate among economically disadvantaged youth. The primary goal of the project is to increase the future employability potential of the participants by increasing their reading and mathematics competencies, helping them clarify their careers, and providing employment experiences. Participants were assigned to various public and private nonprofit organizations for a total of 16 hours of work experience per week. Additionally, each participant was enrolled in educational  activities, which focused on computation, communication, and job finding career skills, for 18 hours per week. In 1985, Project ALERT served 167 students, 157 of whom earned between 7.5 and 22.5 hours of credit by earning a passing grade in from 1 to 3 of their academic subjects. After the program ended, over 60 percent of the participants felt that they possessed those behaviors necessary for employment, and 87 percent attained an improved awareness of career objectives. Because gains were seen in all areas except computation, in the future additional opportunities should be provided for practical application of computation skills. (KH)",

The section on schools discusses low-income students' access to educational resources, compared with other students, and compares LIS with non-LIS Catholic high schools. Teachers, students and principals give perceptions on school climate in LIS schools. The section on students provides information on 9th  and 12th graders' values, religious beliefs and practices, life skills, and behaviors, with emphasis on differences that may be a function of race and family income. The next section discusses the motivations, attitudes, and perspectives of teacher in LIS schools. The section on student outcomes examines the impact of four years of Catholic education on student learning and school characteristics, such as family background, student characteristics, school programs, and climate, that promote growth.

The growth rate for Hispanics in the accession age range of 17.35 is projected to be over three times the rate for Blacks. In 1961, Hispanic accession rates were higher for males than females and were highest of all for insular Puerto Ricans. These accession rates were patterned differently from projections, with non-Puerto Rican Hispanics projected to have higher accession rates  than Puerto Ricans in the period 1980-2000. ESL eligibility rates in 1981 were found to be much higher for Hispanic males than females and Puerto Ricans had higher ESL eligibility rates than other Hispanics, consistent with projections. The proportion of Hispanic accessions eligible for ESL instruction was not projected to change dramatically between 1980 and the end of the century. Results point to the need for continued, high quality English instruction, suitable selection and classification procedures, awareness of cultural differences, and improved data collection methods.

        "description":"This brief digest discusses teenage pregnancy and various educational strategies that appear to affect pregnancy rates. While pregnancy among white teenagers has increased since the 1970s, the birthrate among black teenagers is still five to eight times higher. Teenage mothers and fathers have lower educational attainment and income than their peers who delay childbearing. Early parenthood has short- and long-term consequences for the children as well. Babies of teenage mothers are at risk for low birth weight and high infant mortality; moreover, children of adolescent parents tend to become teenage parents themselves. Some studies show that teenage parents risk alienation from school, unemployment, or underemployment. In contrast, positive school experiences and steady progress  toward employment reduce the changes of teenage pregnancy. Preschool education has been found to correlate positively with later lower delinquency and pregnancy rates in teenagers. Desegregation was also found to correlate positively with a reduction in pregnancy before the age of 18. High educational goals appear to be related to a lower incidence of adolescent pregnancy. Finally, several studies of job training programs show that for those students who do not have aspirations towards higher education, appropriate preparation for employment may serve the same positive purpose in reducing teenage pregnancy.

        "author":["Ascher, Carol"],
        "description":"This brief digest reviews research findings on achieving racial integration in desegregated magnet schools. Studies show that resegregation tends to occur in most schools after desegregation as a result of tracking and ability grouping; furthermore, as the numbers of blacks rise in a school, the resegregation in classrooms tends to rise. A number of cooperative learning techniques have recently been developed which seem to work well in the integrated, heterogeneous classroom and are found to have a positive effect on race relations and achievement. Newly desegregated schools are found to expel a disproportionately high number of black students and, in general, discipline of these students is found to be more severe than with white students. Here again, cooperative learning  techniques are found to build a more positive climate and reduce suspensions. Blacks and other minorities are heavily represented in compensatory education classes which, because they are pull-out programs, tend to increase resegregation. In planning desegregated magnet schools, it appears useful to: (1) maintain a mixed stable student body, (2) include children of different abilities in each classroom, (3) avoid tracking, (4) encourage interracial contact in academic and extracurricular activities, (5) recruit teachers and principals who are concerned with racial equality, (6) initiate staff development programs dealing with desegregation, and (7) involve parents in classroom instruction.

These strategies are conceptually distinct and have been designed to facilitate systematic planning and evaluation of prevention efforts and to allow for comparative assessments of the relative effects of different prevention approaches. Each strategy is based on an assumption regarding the cause of delinquency and presumes a goal of intervention aimed at modifying or eleminating the cause. The 12 strategies are: (1) biological/physiological, (2) psychological/mental health, (3) social network development, (4) criminal influence reduction, (5) power enhancement, (6) role development/role enhancement, (7)  activities/recreation, (8) education/skill development, (9) clear and consistent social expectations, (10) economic resource, (11) deterrence, and (12) abandonment of legal control/social tolerance.

Section 2 describes major changes in the racial wage gap for males from 1940 to 1980 and identifies the distribution of wage gains among important subgroups in the black population. Section 3 describes differential racial trends in schooling and the income benefits associated with education. Section 4 deals with the influence of two dimensions of geographic location: black migration to the North and the increasing urbanization of the black population. The extent to which education and place of residence \"explain\" trends in black-white wage ratios are summarized in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the implications of  three historical developments in recent black economic history: the invention of the mechanical cotton picker, the declining workforce participation rates of low-income blacks during the 1970s, and affirmative action. The final section speculates about likely future trends in the racial wage gap. The 40-year record clearly points to a large improvement in the relative economic status of black men. Although black poverty persists, a large black middle class has emerged. The largest wage improvements were found among younger blacks and college-educated blacks. Education has helped significantly to close the income gap, particularly through the narrowing of education disparities between the races and the improved economic return to black schooling. (KH)",

The report is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 presents background information and describes the purpose and methodology of the study. Chapter 2 outlines a generic model of case management. Chapter 3 describes variations in case management design and implementation, divided into sections dealing with the goals of and impetus for case management, client service delivery issues, institutional relationships, state  administration of case management programs, and financing and cost issues. Chapter 4 presents a summary of findings and conclusions. For the most part case management can have beneficial effects on refugee prospects for self-sufficiency. However, current programs are often marked by confusion about the roles to be played by providers, duplication of effort, and a lack of linkages between the case manager and service providers. Thus, refugee case management appears to be an approach with unrealized potential. Appendices contain an explanation of refugee case management practices in selected states and a short bibliography.

All cultures contain values that can be organized into six &quot;clusters&quot;: nature, the self, society, the supernatural, human nature, and the family. Section 2 provides axiological definitions of the basic value orientations, outlining them as a range of choices toward solving life's problems and evaluating the solutions. Section 3 describes Haitian culture in general terms. It focuses on the history of  colonization, the political situation, education, United States influence, and population trends. Section 4 follows the previously presented outline of value orientations to present details on Haitian values. Finally, Section 4 discusses the influence of culture on the Haitian education system. General features of Haitian education are described, and emphasis is placed on cultural aspects of schooling, such as language use and behavior expectations, which are of interest to North American teachers of Haitian immigrants. It is concluded that American teachers should look beyond the classroom experience to cultural factors in order to understand Haitian students' academic behavior and performance.

First, general research by cross-cultural psychologists is described, focusing on the observation that types of thinking and learning behavior are influenced by social organization and environment. Analytical thinking and field independent behavior, for example, are said to be associated with industrial societies, while relational thinking and field dependence are associated with rural and minority cultures. Next, the paper surveys different types of assessment instruments. Many of these testing devices have fallen out of favor, and factors to be considered in choosing and administering assessment tests are outlined.  These include: (1) purpose of test; (2) results of test; (3) norming population; (4) language dominance and language proficiency; and (5) previous instruction. Different tests and research related to each of these factors are discussed. The paper describes various teaching techniques that can be adapted for multicultural classrooms. These include: mathemagenics for directing learner attention to broad generalizations or specific culturally relevant details; learning through observation; the use of the kinesthetic modality in combination with visual and auditory modalities; and developing heuristic methods for problem solving.

While sometimes thought of as being an overly quantitative and excessively time-consuming activity, strategic planning does not need to be characterized in these terms. In its simplest and most straightforward form it can be a highly qualitative, highly participative, and very worthwhile activity. One model of strategic planning involves a four-phase planning framework. Relationships are established between elements of the planning cycle, time frame orientation, and level of organizational and individual accountability. Strategic planning can provide clear qualitative and quantitative data, effective direction, and meaningful measures  of progress for educational organizations to use in determining their success and in meeting the challenges of the increasingly competitive environment of the future (Aauthor/KC)",

        "description":"This report provides the results of a questionnaire survey of 830 postsecondary vocational-technical students attending state-operated schools in Kentucky. The objectives of the study were: (1) to provide demographic information needed to prepare profiles of typical students by program area; (2) to determine the relationships of economic status and students entry into vocational-technical programs; (3) to analyze standardized test scores of a stratified random sample of students. A discussion of objectives and methodology is followed by the results presented in both narrative and table form. These findings for the total sample are presented: age, number of dependents, education level, sex, race, work experience, marital status, family income, financial aid, program area in which  enrolled, handicap types, employment status, time of day students attend school, General Aptitude Test Battery scores, and Test of Adult Basic Education scores. Profiles that include the above types of information are then provided for students in these program areas: health and personal service, business and office occupations, industrial and technical, home economics, distributive education, and public service. A total of 62 tables are included. (YLB)",

        "description":"This report attempts to answer criticisms that have been leveled against existing research on effective schooling. The research reported has three important features: (1) it is based on a major national survey--High School and Beyond (HSB)--with longitudinal information on each respondent; (2) measures are not restricted to verbal and quantitative test scores; and (3) dynamic modeling with differential equations is applied to guide the statistical analyses. Ten outcomes are examined by the study: verbal test, quantitative test, science test, civics test, educational expectation, occupational expectation, self-esteem, locus of control, work values, and deportment. Four relatively distinct studies are presented in this report. The first examines differences among the 1,000 schools  in the HSB sample on the average level of all 10 outcomes. Having found in the first study that different schools do produce differing levels on the 10 outcomes, the second study investigates school characteristics that may account for those differences. It finds that sector (private/public), school desegregation, and teacher labor relations have little or no effect on the outcomes, while demographic composition, student context, and policy variables have an important effect on test scores, career expectations, and/or self-esteem. The third study compares the effects of dropping out of school on quantitative and verbal test scores. This study concludes that the last two years of high school are effective in bolstering verbal and quantitative skills of most students and that black youth  suffer more from dropping out of school. The fourth study examines effects of curriculum track (academic versus nonacademic) on all 10 outcomes, and finds that effects of tracking on all outcomes except work values are strong, although less so when endogenous variables are controlled. Recommendations based on the studies are presented. (KC)",

        "description":"This publication presents the Adult Language Levels (ALL) Management System as a curriculum and programmatic framework to assist administrators and teachers in implementing a competency-based English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) program. Chapter 1 presents theoretical investigations of adult learning and adult second language development and an explanation of competency-based adult education (CBAE) as an effective teaching approach. The suitability of competency-based principles for ESOL program development is also discussed. Chapter 2 focuses on the importance of and processes involved in conducting an assessment of learners' needs and interests. Chapter 3 highlights the language proficiency levels and testing procedures developed by Baltimore County adult educators to  measure the English language abilities of limited English proficient adults. Chapter 4 describes how the instructor uses the results from the needs assessment and proficiency testing to individualize instruction. A sample lesson is included. Chapter 5 presents an overview of how to monitor student progress. Appendixes, amounting to over one-half of the publication, include (1) seven charts that display the life-skill tasks across proficiency levels and that form the foundation of the curriculum framework, (2) seven tables listing each competency task and its respective performance measure, and (3) an annotated bibliography of curriculum materials.

        "description":"Wilmington College (Ohio) conducted a study to determine if receiving college training during incarceration enhances offenders' post-release behavior. Three hundred residents of Lebanon Correctional Institution in Ohio, a medium-security prison for adults under 30, were studied. Of the group, 95 received associates degrees while in prison. These persons were compared with two groups: 116 offenders at Lebanon who received high school degrees, and 106 who were high school dropouts. The hypothesis of the study, that those offenders who earned associate degrees would be more successful in their reintegration than their non-degreed counterparts, was measured by means of records at the Ohio Adult Parole Authority. &quot;Successful reintegration&quot; was defined as not returning to prison during  the first year on parole. Additional indicators of success included remaining arrest-free for this period and being employed on a full-time basis during the first year of release. The study found that by the end of the first year on parole, more than two-thirds of the college graduates were employed, compared to approximately 60 percent of the high school graduates and 40 percent of the high school dropouts. Thus, the employment data suggest that a linear relationship exists between the level of education an inmate acquires while in prison and the likelihood of obtaining and retaining employment on parole. This linear relationship is echoed on the arrest and recidivism (return to prison either because of conviction or parole violation) variables reported. Although the groups were small,  the study showed that college education during incarceration contributes to inmates' post-release success. (KC)",

The project involved these goals and objectives: (1) staff development for instructors of the basic skills curricula; (2) generating enthusiasm for basic skills instruction in the underprepared student; (3) assessment of student progress through staff development activities; (4) enhanced public relations for the program; and (5) effective administration of the basic skills program based on training of staff and use of resources. To meet these goals, various activities were carried out from July 1985 to June 1986. For example, student progress was assessed in relationship to staff development training, a public relations plan was developed, and a staff  development program was implemented through workshops for teachers. Efforts were evaluated and results were disseminated both in the college and in the community.

Instruments were Taylor's Work Quiz (WQ), the Values Scale (VS) and Salience Inventory (SI) developed for the international Work Importance Study, and Holland's Vocational Preference Inventory (VPI). From the WQ three basic orientations to work in this sample were identified: self-actualizing, instrumental, and necessity. Correlations between the WQ and VS scales showed the self-actualizing orientation was highly correlated to 12 intrinsic values, the instrumental scale was correlated with 17 extrinsic values, and a lack of relationships existed between the necessity orientation and the VS scales. Correlations between the WQ and SI scales showed the  self-actualizing orientation had the strongest relationship with the worker role, the instrumental scale correlated positively only with the leisure scales, and no significant relationship existed betwen the SI scales and the necessity scale. No significant relationship existed between the VPI scales and the self-actualizing orientation; the instrumental orientation highly correlated with the enterprising, realistic, and conventional scales; and the necessity scale correlated with the realistic and conventional scales. These relationships supported expectations. Parallels were identified between study results and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. (YLB)",

        "description":"Previous research on adult cognition has focused mainly on the distance that separates the adult from the \"formal standard\" and on the factors that interact with formal operations whether they are moderators of competence or a hypothetical fifth step. Results of new clinical research on adults can be used to argue for a new constructivism of adult intelligence where equilibrium processes and structuralization of intelligence operate differently from children. This new constructivism is called \"adaptability\" and accounts for four characteristics of adult intellectual evaluation: stability, flexibility, generalizibility, and organizibility of operations. The model of adaptability can be derived from Piaget's theory when one departs from the idea that formal operations are the  essential component of adult intelligence. This suggests that intellectual evaluation of adults could be made more appropriate if it would concern itself more with adult adaptability and concentrate less on adult formal ability.

        "description":"This report compares several farm characteristics of the mid-1980s with those of a decade earlier to document the real amount of change in the farm sector. Farms are stratified into five groups based on their farm income: rural residence, small family, family, large family, and very large. Sources and levels of farm operator income and wealth are first considered. Land ownership and tenure patterns are examined. Some variables are studied that can be measured to indicate variations in farm organization: farming enterprises, technology, yields, and intensity of resource use. An examination follows of changes in the degree of concentration of production and land used for producing specific agricultural commodities. The analysis uses Gini index-Lorenz curves and distribution curves.  Census of Agriculture data for 1974, 1978, and 1982 are used to trace change in several variables that are important measures of the structure of the farm sector. Structural change variables are examined in both nominal and real terms. A final section describes further the five sales classes. Regions are compared with the national average. The basic structural characteristics addressed are farm numbers and size, asset value, sales, tenure, organization, off-farm work, age, and expenses. Forty-nine tables supplement the text, and a short list of other agricultural reports is included. (YLB)",

The region had an above-average share of employment in the national fast-growth sectors (services, finance, insurance, and real estate), and employment growth rates in those sectors were near the national average. The region lost manufacturing employment at about the same rate as the rest of the nation going into the 1975 and 1982 recessions, but failed to match the nation's recoveries. The region's decline in manufacturing employment from 1974-84 occurred in nearly all the major manufacturing industries and in most of the states for each industry. A  comparison of metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas within the Mid-Atlantic region from 1974 to 1984 revealed that although non-metropolitan areas led metropolitan areas in employment growth rates between 1974-79, employment declined in non-metropolitan areas from 1979-84 while employment in metropolitan areas continued to grow. Non-metropolitan areas dependent on mining and manufacturing and metropolitan areas in the region's interior fared worse than metropolitan areas in the New York City--Philadelphia corridor oriented toward fast-growth industries.

        "description":"A comparison of the vocational education and training (VET) offered in Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United States revealed that programs in all three nations emphasized the following aims: competence at work, commitment of all to achieve excellence, and capacity to contribute to change. Organizations in all three nations were increasingly looking for, and prepared to help develop, people with the ability to use acquired knowledge and skills effectively in changing circumstances and in an integrated system. Although the United States appeared to be well tuned to a climate of moderate change, it appeared much less reflective about the future and appeared to lack an educational strategy, especially at the secondary level. Germany had systems that work well and in  a stable environment; however, change appeared to be slow. Although Japan's VET strategies have given the country a highly educated working population, the downside of its success in corporate organization and individual service for the greater good is probably an underdevelopment in the kind of creativity that flourishes with wayward individual opportunities. Great Britain's imperial past, on the other hand, appears to continue to hamper the country's progress in the area of VET. (MN)",

Educators must eliminate the inapplicability and the crudeness of the present division between academic, vocational, and general educational programs in the secondary schools. The major challenge in the years ahead will be to create a more comprehensive continuum to cater to the gamut of human intellectual capabilities. Instead of vocational schools per se what is needed are schools of applied knowledge where people of various ages gather at different points in their lives to receive education and training in a variety of fields, including preparation for technical, paraprofessional, and artistic endeavors. Such a school or center will  have two foci: it will concentrate more on concrete, more practical forms of education, and it will direct considerable resources to the transition from school to work. The school will be a center of learning and its boundaries will be near such transitional offices or units as placement or job service offices, work-study coordination agencies, guild or union facilities, and military and college recruitment outposts and social service welfare offices.

Part A describes Nutri-Calc in terms of subject area (food and nutrition) and hardware requirements (IBM-PC or XT, Apple II, MacIntosh, or TRS80) and indicates its suitability for use with students in grade 11 and up. Listed next are accompanying materials (manual) and time estimate (30 minutes). Availability information includes cost ($99.95), policies, and contact address. Part B contains the evaluation criteria in eight categories; reviewer ratings appear as  yes, somewhat, no, and not applicable, with explanatory comments. Part C summarizes the evaluation. This program could supplement a nutrition class, but classroom discussion is needed. Instructors were found to be difficult to follow and unclear. Moreover, some program commands do not work, it is difficult to exit, and the manual is not clearly written. A summary section shows that this courseware received overall ratings of &quot;yes&quot; for subject matter and application programs; &quot;somewhat&quot; for technical presentation, student interaction, and documentation; and &quot;not applicable&quot; for program interaction, student evaluation, and work behaviors. The program can be used to supplement class material, with help from the instructor. (SK)",

There are many nonleather, natural, and synthetic man-made material sandals, boots, and shoes. For the person who needs foot protection, there is a company that has designed a boot that costs one-half its leather counterpart with twice the durability. The footwear needs of an individual who works in a contemporary business or office setting can be met by a canvas and rubber shoe that performs excellently and looks good at one-sixth the cost of its leather counterpart. A more widely available shoe for less formal purposes is the open weave, mesh top shoe, which comes in three colors and is practical  in terms of wearability, style, and cost. Sandals are internationally popular, simple, inexpensive, and cool in hot climates. There are many varieties of sandal, from synthetic rope soles and straps, tire-tread soled sandals, Japanese wooden sandals, which are relatively easy to make, to the form-fitting wooden sandals of India which are more difficult to construct. Also in vegetarian India there are water buffalo hide sandals, the leather for which is obtained from animals that died naturally because of age or disease. Other popular styles are plastic Chinese sandals, thongs, and garden togs. The Mongolian felt footwear is warm and practical if worn indoors or inside other shoes meant to be worn outdoors. (AEM)",

However, instead of the major educational modifications necessary to accompany these changes, minor curriculum changes have taken place. The need to modify education programs is severe at the undergraduate level, and associate and bachelor degrees need to be reflective of a more modern multi-faceted reality. Education must be provided in a manner that will maximize students' facility in adjusting to the realities of the workplace, and programs must be developed to permit increased vocational mobility, permit students to move from social work to allied fields, and allow others to move to social work from related areas. The most glaring deficiencies in the  programs have been in business related skill development. Students need to be able to understand how the agencies in which they will work operate financially and where and how agencies obtain funding and should have enough business skills to prepare budgets for departments and clients and write grants and proposals that include financial justification. In a society where there is competition among social service and allied health agencies, a basic understanding of marketing is necessary for agencies to survive. A multi-tracked program which includes urban community studies with a business emphasis, computer skills, and social services components has been developed for the two year associate degree program as both an applied and transferable program.

Students apply for classroom jobs, run businesses, pay taxes, buy rental properties, and make investments. Chapter one of the guide deals with the effectiveness of using the mini-economy in economics instruction. Chapter two presents steps for establishing the mini-economy, such as: (1) designing the classroom money; (2) determining what items and privileges the money will buy; (3) determining how to distribute items and class privileges; and (4) deciding how students will earn the money. After the mini-economy has been  established, chapter three illustrates ways of expanding it, such as establishing banks, insurance companies, and real estate companies. Chapter four deals with concerns that teachers may have about carrying out economic activities in the classroom. Resources for implementing the mini-economy are: (1) a 12-item bibliography of curriculum material; (2) a glossary of economic terms; (3) suggested models for inservice; and (4) reproducible mini-economy aids.

        "description":"In recent years, assessment of what is actually learned or accomplished in a college career has gained increasing attention. An instructor of a weather and climate geography course at Illinois State University constructed a 25-question multiple choice test in order to develop a method of assessing what his students learned during the course. The tests were administered to each section of the course on the first day of classes and again on the last day of classes. Because not all students who ultimately enrolled were present on the first day and not everyone bothered to attend on the last day, out of a possible 396 students, only 143 took both the pre-test and the post-test. For the pre-test, the mean was 23.6, illustrating little knowledge of weather and climate. For the  post-test the mean was 43.5. Before-and-after testing may prove the worth of a course or program, but there are problems. Due to enrollment procedures used at many universities, it will always be difficult to test everyone. The second problem is student motivation in taking such tests. At the present time, the test scores are not considered in a student's grade; thus there is no real motivation to do well on them.

An analysis is included: &quot;The Status of Social Studies in the United States in the mid-1980s,&quot; by Irving Morrisset. Generalizable findings are that: (1) the &quot;flavor&quot; of social studies throughout the country is highly prescriptive; (2) major changes in requirements and recommendations for teachers in training, teacher certification, and inservice assessment have taken place since 1976; (3) most states have  increased graduation requirements, many in the context of statewide testing and specification of competencies for specific courses; (4) in most states various courses are required, in addition to several history courses, either at state or local levels, and requirements for such courses have been increased; (5) the duties and influence of state social studies specialists vary greatly from state to state; and (6) recent trends in social studies with respect to requirements for teachers, students, and curricula predominantly are toward tighter requirements or recommendations and are seen overwhelmingly by state social studies specialists as being favorable to social studies in their own state and in the nation as a whole.

        "description":"Becoming involved in the arts is a process that involves movement through several stages, from disinterest to active attendance at and enthusiasm for performing arts events. Since target consumers at any time will differ in their placement on this continuum, marketing programs to expand arts audiences must first identify where each target segment is and then motivate that group to move to the next stage. A six-stage model, labelled the \"Performing Arts Adoption Process,\" is a first approximation of this process. Data from the survey of Public Participation in the Arts are used to test the model and explore its implications. Detailed comparisons of consumers at adjacent stages in the process, using both bivariate and multivariate analytic techniques, appear to support both the  validity and the usefulness of the model to both arts managers and future researchers in the field.

This assessment investigates the capacity of leading U.S. social studies and history textbooks to inspire the imagination of students through effective literary, pictorial, and historigraphic techniques. Twelve panelists of historians, journalists, editors, and teachers were charged to act as expert reviewers of textbooks at the fifth, eighth, and eleventh grade levels. The review specifically sought to examine books in depth and to identify and review those texts already established in the marketplace. The reviewers found that many U.S. history textbooks strive for simple, inoffensive  prose that often lacks the qualities of good literature and fine history. While these textbooks may be effective reference materials, they are not compilations aimed at inspiring and exciting the reader through vital treatment of subject. Recommendations of the panelists include: (1) scaling down the size of textbooks; (2) rededicating textbooks to the text; (3) hiring better textbook writers; (4) emphasizing primary source materials; (5) putting minority group issues into historical context; and (6) initiating textbook review by independent sources, such as newspapers and news magazines.

Constitution Bicentennial celebration in the areas of curriculum development and instruction and whether or not the celebration has been accompanied by educational renewal and improvement in secondary schools. Persistent problems in teaching and learning about U.S. constitutional history include confused curriculum priorities, inadequate treatment in some textbooks, and serious deficiencies in students' knowledge. Promising teaching practices and methods include the development of new resources, such as: (1) educational television programs; (2) history lessons that might supplement shallow and bland textbooks; (3) study units on specific historical periods or themes; and (4) classroom forums for  detailed study of historical issues. Recommendations, useful in sustaining the Bicentennial's achievements, include the need to: (1) assign high priority to goals and content selection criteria concerning the historical role of the U.S. Constitution; (2) expand coverage of the U.S. Constitution in standard secondary school textbooks; (3) provide students with opportunities for in-depth studies of major events, issues, and themes; (4) use lessons that require interpretation, analysis, and synthesis of primary sources; (5) emphasize ideas in constitutional history; (6) stress the paradoxes of U.S. constitutional government; (7) connect the U.S. Constitution to contemporary citizenship concerns; and (8) use comparative and global perspectives.

The proposed model provides educational leaders with an enhanced context within which one can effectively analyze and evaluate policies and procedures, critical issues, and decision making processes, and determine educational practices that will result in more effective schools. The model serves as a framework for analysis and evaluation and includes the following components: (1) the foundations of education (historical, philosophical, sociological, political and organizational) and how these perspectives should be considered in the decision making process and their relationship to administrative behavior and the decision setting; (2) the functions of management and their role in the decision making process; (3) the implications of policy development related to the decision and the policy's ensuing procedures with emphasis on the appropriate level of policy/procedure development and how a policy can be integrated into the life of an organization; and (4) the use of the attributes/findings of the more effective schools research as a criterion for analyzing, evaluating and implementing policies and procedures to carry out the decision.

This paper reports an effort to utilize model building to generate research. A discussion is first presented on the process of model building, and a working model of teacher career stages is presented. The model is based on the following phases of a teaching career: (1) pre-service; (2) induction; (3) competency building; (4) enthusiastic and growing; (5) career frustration; (6) stable and stagnant; (7) career wind-down; and (8) career exit. The concerns and characteristics of teachers during each of these phases are described. A discussion is presented on the personal and organizational influences on the teacher's career cycle. Incentives for professional growth  are analyzed, and a review is offered of diverse professional delivery modes. The research questions that formed the foundation for this study were derived from the Teacher Career Cycle Model. These questions concerned whether or not there are differences among career stages with regard to: (1) self-reported characteristics of teachers; (2) teacher identified personal and organizational environmental influences; (3) teacher identified appropriate incentives and rewards; and (4) teacher identified appropriate professional delivery models. Implications of the research findings are reviewed in terms of refinement of the Career Cycle Model and future research and practice. A 67-item reference list is included. (JD)",

In most instances, however, the early stages of this process have focused primarily upon academic criteria for selection. Several research projects in recent years have attempted to identify and study \"effective\" teachers, and these efforts have suggested that many of the significant variables that seem to be associated with effective teaching are non-academic in nature. Instead, they indicate that personality factors, affective variables and value system factors, among others, are important in understanding the characteristics of effective teaching. The review of literature undertaken in this study was intended to compile  the findings of the numerous investigations into non-academic factors associated with effective teaching and to analyze those findings to discover common patterns and trends. Conclusions were drawn and offered for consideration in the development of national and state certification procedures. Suggestions were also made for how this information can be integrated into procedures for identifying and selecting teacher education candidates for admission to teacher training programs. Sixty-eight references are appended. (Author/JD)",

However, the state has been endorsing the trend toward retirement at 55 years of age and 25 years of experience, leaving the public schools with a potential &quot;en masse&quot; turnover of 35.8 percent of the administrative staff. Many replacements would be needed, and the pool must be large enough to include women. Through a cooperative program between the school district and Utah State University, relevant, current, and practical training courses were developed. Courses were delivered on site in the school district. The spring of 1987 and the autumn of the 1987-88 school year saw the dramatic turnover. Teachers had been trained in the  administrative/supervisory program and were ready to apply as the positions were vacated. A report of the number of new principals hired in the district, the increase in the number of female principals, and an overview of the numbers and quality of applicants are analyzed as validation of the program's success.

The paper focuses on the strains of the mentor/principal relationship in the Los Angeles Unified School District, California. The problem examined is that of the complications faced by mentor teachers in asserting the role of instructional leader with principals who have traditionally assumed that role. Twenty-two mentor teachers each wrote six vignettes describing their successful and less successful experiences with their assigned mentee teachers, and their relationships with administrators and other colleagues. An analysis is presented of six vignettes. The first two deal with the mentors' reactions to inappropriate  requests from their principals. The next pair illustrate how a mentor-teacher relationship can be compromised when a principal inappropriately divulges confidential information to the mentee. The last two cases illuminate the mentors' frustration when they work with mediocre neophytes. Some of the cases are accompanied by reactions from other teachers. A discussion of the analysis highlights problems in the areas of nation-wide induction programs, and the evaluation of teachers. Two model teacher evaluation systems are briefly described. (JD)",

The vignettes served as a catalyst to stimulate discussion about issues concerning the new role of mentor teachers. These vignettes were then incorportated into a casebook that integrated research knowledge with practitioner knowledge.

        "description":"This handbook was generated by a survey of the specific needs of the coaching community serving young children as athletic coaches. The survey revealed a need for information that addresses the needs of beginning level volunteer coaches. The first section discusses the benefits of competitive sports for children and youth and the role of the youth sports coach. In the second section, the ways children grow and develop are considered with guidelines offered for selecting skills to be taught, rules and strategies, and preventing athletic injuries. Goalsetting, motivating, and teaching values and sportsmanship are included in this section as well as suggestions on how to analyze sport skills. Practical advice is offered in the third section on planning, practicing, running  competitions, and dealing with parents. The final section offers information on emergency procedures, legal liabilities, sports for disabled children, and co-ed competition. Program evaluation procedures are also discussed in this section.

The instruments used in testing the subjects were: (1) the modified Mehrabian &amp; Epstein Empathy test (1972); (2) the Battle Self-Esteem Scale, Form B (1981); (3) the Coopersmith modified Self-Esteem Scale (23 items); (4) the Assertiveness Scale by Osborn &amp; Harris (1978); (5) the Narcissism Scale by Emmons (1984); and (6) the Torrance Creativity Scale (Figural form). A questionnaire surveying interests and psychosomatic symptoms was also planned for the study. The findings indicated: (1) empathy as well as self-esteem and self-assertiveness seemed to increase statistically significantly with age; (2) girls were  more empathetic and more sensitive than boys; (3) there were no differences according to sex in self-esteem; (4) the subjects became increasingly narcissistic and self-assertive but less sensitive with the years spent in active playing; and (5) no effect on total empathy scores was found, although self-esteem increased with the playing years. An analysis of these results is presented. (JD)",

        "description":"The use of exercise as a general treatment for rheumatoid arthritics (RA) has included range of motion, muscular strength, water exercise and rest therapy while virtually ignoring possible benefits of aerobic exercise. The purposes of this project were to examine the guidelines for exercise prescription in relation to this special population and to determine the effects of a 12-week progressive, interval-type cycling program on physiological variables as well as perceived lifestyle changes in a small sample (n=4) of RA. Measures of physical work capacity (PWC), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), blood pressure (BP), and flexibility were completed prior to and at completion of the exercise program. In addition, questionnaires concerning medical history and lifestyle were  completed. After 12 weeks of internal cycling, significant improvements were noted. Blood pressure decreased substantially during work and RPE was lower. Changes in flexibility at the hip, knee and ankle were minimal. Lifestyle benefits included reduction in fatigue, less pain throughout the day, and a reduction in daily pain medication. In conclusion, the results from this small sample of RA suggests the possible benefits of land cycling for RA and the ability of this group of individuals to withstand the rigors of such a program. However, some additional questions regarding appropriate exercise testing and prescription for RA indicate the need for further research. (Author/JD)",

The ideographic characteristics considered were date of graduation and level of work experience; the incentives considered were receipt of a newsletter and/or receipt of 25 cents mailed with the survey. Analysis of returns showed: (1) sampling former students across level of teaching experience and year of graduation did not result in a response bias to an instrument seeking perceptions on topics of general professional interest to teachers; (2) using  incentives did not introduce a response bias; (3) receipt of a university newsletter did produce a higher response ratio, but receipt of a small monetary incentive (25 cents) did not; and (4) using multiple mailouts to increase the number of responses did not affect response patterns across mailout requests.

Two attitude tests, Berryman and Berryman's Attitudes Toward Mainstreaming Scale and Hall's Stages of Concern Questionnaire, are also briefly described. The identification of teacher attitudes is important because of the effects of teachers' expectations on students, as well as the relevance of teacher attitudes for evaluating program effectiveness. Teacher attitudes, both toward handicapped students and toward mainstreaming, can be measured by rating scales, interval scales, rank order, Q sorts, semantic differential techniques, sociometric techniques, adjective checklists,  questionnaires, and interviews. Research shows that many teachers express negative views about handicapped students and mainstreaming, especially for emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded students. Both support services and teacher education are associated with more positive teacher attitudes. (GDC)",

        "description":"This brief overview of minimum competency testing and disabled high school students discusses: the inclusion or exclusion of handicapped students in minimum competency testing programs; approaches to accommodating the individual needs of handicapped students; and legal issues. Surveys of states that have mandated minimum competency tests indicate that many states' requirements specifically mention provisions for handicapped students. The method of test administration is often modified, and should be based on the modifications indicated in the student's individualized educational program (IEP). Approaches which have been used by states include: (1) the exclusion of severely handicapped students; (2) use of different graduation requirements, such as completion of the IEP or a  different weight for the test score; and (3) testing modifications which allow physically disabled students to complete the test, such as Braille editions. Legal problems may arise when certain students are not allowed to take the minimum competency test, and are therefore denied the opportunity to earn a diploma. Problems of discrimination may also arise if remedial instruction is not available to disabled students, or if evaluation standards are applied inconsistently within a state. (GDC)",

        "description":"Research on student evaluation of college teachers' performance is briefly summarized. Lawrence M. Aleamoni offers four arguments in favor of student ratings: (1) students are the main source of information about the educational environment; (2) students are the most logical evaluators of student satisfaction and effectiveness of course elements; (3) the student-teacher communication involved raises the level of instruction; and (4) use of student ratings by other students in course selection may increase the possibilities that excellence in instruction will be rewarded. Although faculty have expressed concern about the ratings being measures of popularity, research indicates that students can effectively discriminate between teaching effectiveness and other affective dimensions.  Research does not support strong relationships between teacher ratings and student grades, while research on the effect of class size is inconclusive. It is noted that design of the rating forms should consider the purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative); that the ratings should be administered by appropriate departments; and that a summary of results should be available quickly. In general, individual respondents' comments should not be published. (GDC)",

        "description":"Current practice in educational program evaluation was examined through analyses of 232 reports submitted, from 1980 to 1983, by institutions seeking approval for their programs from the U.S. Department of Education's Joint Dissemination Review Panel (JDRP). The JDRP reviews these reports to determine whether educational programs have demonstrated that they are effective. This study also examined how evaluation methods differed for programs which were approved or not approved by the JDRP during this time period. Certain features were found more often in programs approved than those not approved. These included: (1) the presence of an independent evaluator affiliated with a research firm; (2) the use of more than one evaluation design; (3) the absence of obvious errors in data  analyses; and (4) the implementation of evaluation designs of high quality. Features of the educational programs and their evaluations were documented through content analyses. Descriptive profiles were developed for the entire sample, as well as the subsamples of approved and not-approved programs. Regression analyses were used to relate differences in evaluation methodology to differences in the programs' effect size. The appended tables include summary data on program content, approvals, grade level, evaluators, outcome measures used, test validity and reliability, evaluation design, data analysis, and effect size. A 36-item reference list concludes the document. (MAC)",

The concrete and abstract attitudes are not acquired or learned but are capacity levels of the entire personality. The eight characteristics of the abstract attitude are listed, as well as descriptions of the five sub-tests making up the individual performance test battery: (1)  Goldstein-Scheerer Cube Test; (2) Gelb-Goldstein Color Sorting Test; (3) Gelb-Goldstein-Weigl-Scheerer Object Sorting Test; (4) Weigl-Goldstein-Scheerer Color Form Sorting Test; and (5) Goldstein-Scheerer Stick Test.

        "description":"Adults' responses to a survey of television viewing were investigated to examine the premise that respondents assume that the range of precoded response alternatives reflects the researcher's knowledge of the distribution of opinions or behaviors in the population. Responses are, therefore, a function of the response alternatives provided. Respondents assume that the average respondent is represented by the values in the middle range of the response alternatives, and that the values at the extremes of the scale also represent the extremes of the distribution. These assumptions may mediate the impact of response alternatives on respondents' reports in two ways. Respondents may either use the range of the response alternatives as a frame of reference in estimating their own  behavioral frequencies, or they may be reluctant to report frequencies that appear extreme in the context of the scale. Three experiments were conducted to differentiate between the frame of reference and the social desirability hypotheses. Subjects included American undergraduate students and West German adults. The results of all studies favored the frame of reference hypothesis, i.e. that respondents use the range of the response alternatives as a frame of reference in estimating their own behavioral frequencies.

This was the second administration of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS), in reading, language arts, and mathematics, with science and social studies tests administered in grade 11. School and district scores were extensively tabulated and reported. Overall test results were above the national average in all content areas at all grade levels. In all grades, Total Mathematics scores were higher than Total Reading scores, and in all grades for which Total Language scores were available, they were higher than Total Reading scores. Higher average  scores were observed in the primary grades. In general, these trends across grades and subtests were the same as those reported in 1984 and 1985 Statewide Test Results Report.

NELS:88 is a national, longitudinal study designed to provide trend data about the critical transitions of young people as they develop, attend school, and enter the work force. The base-year NELS will survey a sample of 26,200 eighth graders from 800 public and 200 private schools. Follow-up surveys will be repeated every two years. NELS questionnaires include surveys of students, teachers, administrators, and parents; both biographical and attitudinal items are included. The student survey also contains cognitive tests in reading/English, mathematics, science, and social studies. Five states were selected  as field test sites for these instruments. A number of analyses were conducted on the test items and the sampling procedures. Both classical test theory and latent trait theory were used to determine the most appropriate items. The field test also examined the effects of conducting orientations and ways of distributing parent questionnaires. Results generally demonstrated the appropriateness of the survey design, procedures, and instruments. Problems with specific items were reported. This report includes chapters on: (1) field test preparation; (2) student data collection; (3) analysis of student survey results; (4) parent survey; and (5) school and teacher surveys. The extensive appendices contain nine research instruments: Eighth Grade Locator Booklet; Eighth Grade Questionnaire; Tenth  Grade Questionnaire; Twelfth Grade Questionnaire; Parent Questionnaire; Teacher Questionnaire; School Questionnaire; New York Supplement; and Summary of Cognitive Test Battery.

OCES agents developed materials to facilitate: (1) accepting the situation; (2) understanding transferrable skills; (3) realizing interests comparable to farming; and (4) exploring career and job options. Agents received intensive training in data collection, counseling families, and referral. Instruments to gather baseline data, to record interviews, and to  make pre-post test comparisons were developed by OCES personnel. Two of those instruments, a preliminary discussion form and a log sheet, are included as appendices to the report.

Cognitive styles tend to be bipolar and less value-laden than ability or aptitude measures. Conceptualizations of cognitive style differ in the number of styles and the degree of metacognitive control over them which individuals are presumed to have. The Hill model, the McKenny-Keen Model, and the Cognitive-Dimensions Model are discussed. In particular, the paper describes measures and reviews research pertaining to nine cognitive dimensions identified in an earlier review by Messick: (1) field dependence-independence; (2) reflectivity-impulsivity; (3) scanning; (4) breadth of categorization; (5) conceptualizing style; (6) cognitive complexity-simplicity; (7) leveling-sharpening; (8)  distractibility; and (9) tolerance for unrealistic experience. Other cognitive style definitions utilize visual-haptic, analytical-global, and verbal-visual dimensions. Research on relationships among measures is summarized, and their lack of convergence suggests that there are a multitude of cognitive styles or dimensions of cognitive style. The dimensions that seem most conceptually comprehensive and potentially independent are field dependence-independence, distractibility, tendency to use global versus analytical problem-solving strategies, and preferred medium for obtaining information (e.g., visual-haptic; verbal-visual).

        "description":"A multivariate modeling approach was developed to assess the impact of changes in aptitude requirement minimums on U.S. Air Force technical training outcomes. Initially, interviews were conducted with technical training personnel to identify significant student inputs, course content, and training outcome variables. Measures of these variables were formulated on the basis of personnel records and routinely available training documents, and data were assembled for over 5,000 trainees in 39 initial-skills courses at five Air Force bases. A cross-validation sample consisted of about 1,000 trainees in nine courses. Using formal path analysis (LISREL V computer program), an empirical model of the training process was developed. Although aptitude was one of the best predictors of the  quality of student performance, it interacted with a variety of other student input and course content variables in determining training outcomes. Course content variables tended to be defined by course subject-matter difficulty, occupational difficulty, and manpower requirements. Counseling mediated the relationship between training performance and distal training outcomes such as retraining time and student elimination. Appendices present sample interview questions, an Air Force policy document on student measurement (with reporting forms), and tables of input statistics and path analysis results. (LPG)",

Alternate forms of a 28-item true-false test were administered as a pretest and posttest to 18 undergraduate and 19 graduate students enrolled in introductory educational statistics courses at the University of Alabama. Cronbach's alpha and corrected item-total correlations were computed for the pretest. Item analysis resulted in the elimination of 10 items from the original instrument. The alpha coefficient for the resulting 18-item instrument was .75. Total pretest scores were correlated with each of three course exams and with course average. Results revealed significant correlations with examinations  administered after the first examination for the sample as a whole. However, correlations for the two separate groups revealed significant results only for undergraduates. A groups-by-tests repeated measures design was employed to detect between-group differences and mathematics skills improvement from pretest to posttest. Both groups improved, with greater improvement shown for undergraduates, but no conclusions could be drawn regarding the reason for the improvement. (Author/JGL)",

Eleven schools participated in a 1981-82 pilot study. Faculties at the pilot schools completed the evaluation and responded to a postevaluation questionnaire; steering committee chairpersons were also interviewed. Questionnaire results showed that the new instrument was rated Good or Excellent by 69% of those  responding and Fair or Poor by 31%. As major strengths of the instrument, participants mentioned that: (1) it promoted a total overview of the schools' programs; (2) it was thorough and comprehensive; and (3) it promoted interaction. The responses from steering committee chairpersons were similar, but they cited as the chief strength the fact that articulation was encouraged. Both groups cited repetitiousness and vagueness of some items as overall weaknesses. The instrument was revised to remedy these weaknesses.

Machine scoring procedures are detailed, and results tabulated, showing that the SMRT was relatively easy (mean about 80% correct) with a negatively skewed score distribution. Subtest percentage scores are given by school and by district, as well as norms in percentiles and stanines. A professional panel of teachers, supervisors, and two Educational Testing Service personnel rated the usefulness of SMRT and made suggestions for relevant school improvement plans. To develop mastery scores and  minimum standards, the panel judged item difficulty for three reading competency levels (satisfactory, minimum, below minimum); these judgments were coordinated with actual proportion correct on each item for three groups defined by Degrees of Reading Power test scores. The report considers the validity, reliability, and predictive value of SMRT, and its relation to National Assessment of Educational Progress norms.

Results showed that the overall performance by Delaware students tested (regular and special education combined) was above the national average in all content areas at all grade levels. In all grades, Total Mathematics scores were higher than Total Reading scores. In all grades for which Total Language scores were available, Total Language scores were higher than Total Reading  scores. In comparisons across grades, students in the primary grades generally obtained higher scores than those in upper grades. These trends across grades and subtests are the same as those reported in the 1984 and 1985 Statewide Test Results Report.

Although Federal spending in these territories would double, more revenue would be generated from the taxes. This revenue may decline over time however, due to the loss of business tax incentives for American corporations with operations in the territories. Analysis of the considered change shows an increase in Federal costs in the territories and a decrease in their own costs. The leaders in these territories are not in favor of extending the Federal income tax. Some  favored the extension of aid programs but expressed some concern about welfare dependency, work disincentives, and an influx of immigrants who want public assistance.

A total of 31 women participated in three survival skills training groups involved in three studies over a period of three years. The program was improved as 28 groups (over 300 women) were trained in the Kansas City (Kansas) area. Using evaluation measures of workshop unit tests, direct observations of participant behavior (studies 1 and 2 only), direct observations of facilitator behavior, take-home  practice projects completed, and attendance at sessions, for process, outcome and participant satisfaction, it was demonstrated that the survival skills were effectively mastered and that improved versions of the program increased participants' application of the program content to their everyday lives. The program offers the opportunity for women to acquire key skills and to develop social networks, which guard against the isolation so common in urban environments. The model is being disseminated to community agencies that deal with women. Five tables and seven figures present definitions and statistical data. (VM)",

Research methods include interviews with staff (over 300 individuals) and collection of statistical data. A conceptual framework for studying these issues is presented and the data collection procedures are discussed. Three types of teacher commitment and two types of student commitment have been found. Interrelationships between teacher commitment and student commitment have been uncovered. Correlates and results of this ongoing study are presented in figures, charts, and tables. Emerging themes in student and teacher commitment are listed. General preliminary findings suggest the  following: (1) the district context influences student and teacher commitment; (2) there is an interplay between student and teacher commitment; and (3) a variety of school factors influence the interaction between teachers and students.

A high level of economic and social distress is associated with high dropout rates. To help institutions to more effectively address the needs of disadvantaged people, the New York State Board of Regents adopted, in 1985, a policy statement which underscored the role of schools in cooperating with other human service providers on this issue. The Regents specifically called for the use of schools as bases of operation for the delivery of comprehensive services. Suggestions for these services include the following: (1) human services for students and their families which address the  out-of-school causes of low performance; (2) academic support services available on a 12-month basis; and (3) educational services targeted toward hard-to-serve or special populations. This document contains the text of the Regents' policy, a list of potential funding sources, and two annotated bibliographies. (VM)",

        "description":"To be maximally effective in solving problems, researchers must place their methodological and theoretical models of science within social and political contexts. They must become aware of biases and assumptions and move toward a more valid perception of social realities. Psychologists must view women in the situational context within which behaviors happen, and must avoid the sexist viewpoints which have been traditional in American culture. This paper discusses the scientific method in terms of the social and political contexts of our culture and suggests five critical areas which behaviorists must analyze as they develop programs for minorities. These areas are: (1) formulation of the problem; (2) operationalization of the program/research; (3) consideration (or lack of  consideration) of the social-political context in which women behave; (4) experimenter bias; and (5) analysis and inference. A case study of the Juniper Gardens Children's Project from 1979 to 1982 is presented. (Author/VM)",

This gap in service has led to the exploration and utilization of nonprofessionals to fill these roles. Many of these nonprofessionals are peers of the needy people. This adds the advantage of \"peer relationships\" as a positive dimension in the interaction of helper and client. Two programs at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the University of Kansas--the Juniper Gardens Family Education Program (FEP) and Survival Skills for Urban Women--use this model where women become peer trainers for program participants. Evaluations of these and other peer training programs show the efficacy of using peer trainers as deliverers of behavioral  community programs. For maximal utilization of this model the following five strategies are suggested: (1) selecting peer-trainers; (2) establishing competencies; (3) training competencies; (4) measuring outcome/monitoring performance; and (5) maintaining acquired competencies/quality control.

These goods and services have not been counted when measuring the income and poverty of the recipients. This report examines three proposals to change the manner in which poverty is measured. All include ways to calculate the value of noncash benefits. The examination of each proposal is based on the following five questions: (1) What is the basis for defining income?; (2) Are the methods valid?; (3) Do the values that are assigned actually represent the benefits that are received?; (4) What is the quality of the data and analytic procedures used to assess benefit values?; and (5) Are definitions used consistently across key steps of poverty measurement?

Although the conclusions of the reports are not the same, there are some developing consensuses. Findings are discussed in the following areas: (1) how are recipients of Chapter 1 services selected? (2) do those who most need the services receive them? (3) among the program structures that have been used (pull-out, add-on, in-class, and replacement) are there reasons to choose one over another? (4) which instructional strategies are used (mastery learning, higher order thinking skills, and computer education), and are they effective? (5) how have parents participated  in the programs and are there new ways for them to become involved? and (6) does compensatory education increase achievement? It is concluded that the success of the programs has been mixed in all of the areas listed above. It is clear that low-achieving students need some type of help, but there are some serious problems with Chapter 1 in the following areas: (1) it is not enrichment since it takes students away from other instruction; (2) there are inefficiencies in grouping and regrouping students during the day; and (3) the teaching of Chapter 1 students lags behind research findings on equity and pedagogy.

Often the lack of literacy and achievement in these subjects is due to the following factors: (1) cognitive differences between how the information is presented and how the students process it; (2) lack of familiarity, because of cultural differences with the context in which the material is taught; (3) family stress due to poverty and/or unemployment; (4) racial and cultural biases that may lead teachers and parents to believe that minorities and women cannot get jobs in technology or aren't suited for them, and therefore shouldn't waste effort learning subjects that will be of no career use; (5) the perception that physically disabled students cannot function safely in a  technological environment; and (6) tracking that steers certain groups away from academic or technical courses. Recently a range of successful educational policies, programs, and methods have been identified to help these students. They are the following: (1) high quality programs with longevity and continuity; (2) high quality diverse staff who are role models for the participants; (3) recontextualization, which allows students to understand the material in the context of their own lives; (4) cultural and language sensitivity; (5) anxiety-reducing strategies; (6) improved programming; and (7) cooperative, heterogeneous grouping of students.

For the student in need of academic help, peer tutoring programs provide an opportunity to learn in a more nonthreatening environment than the classroom. Immediate feedback and clarification of information is possible. For the student tutor, these programs reinforce their own knowledge, build their self-esteem, and develop a sense of responsibility. The experience may result in improved attitudes for both the tutor and the learner, and can also foster cross- cultural and interracial awareness. The use of peer tutors in the classroom can make teachers more flexible and enable them to better target their efforts toward individual  students. Effective peer tutoring programs have used the follow steps to guide their work: (1) establish a planning group; (2) assess student needs; (3) develop measurable goals and objectives; (4) determine faculty, material, and equipment needs; (5) develop a draft plan for school staff and parental review; (6) formally present a revised plan; (7) conduct an orientation; and (8) conduct ongoing evaluation.

It describes the major issues involved in funding education and proposes alternative ways of addressing them. The issues are the following: (1) every student should have access to an education which meets his/her needs, but the costs of this education varies widely across the province; (2) there are significant inequities in the level of taxes paid by residential and non-residential taxpayers; and (3) school boards are increasingly dependent on local revenues and some do not want this local taxing power eroded. In addition to these issues there are five principles of education funding contained in Alberta's New School Act which must be considered in any new school finance plan. They are the  following: (1) access to quality education; (2) equity; (3) flexibility; (4) responsiveness; and (5) accountability. Five new funding options are proposed in consideration of the issues and principles. Their advantages and disadvantages are presented. Statistical data are included in two appendices. (VM)",

        "description":"This volume is a collection of profiles of 130 outstanding Chapter 1 programs across the United States. All of the programs have been given special recognition by the United States Department of Education because they have been unusually successful in meeting the needs of disadvantaged students. The criteria used for judging the effectiveness of a project were based on the number of attributes incorporated from the following list: (1) clear project goals and objectives; (2) coordination with the regular school program/other special programs; (3) parent/community involvement; (4) professional development and training; (5) strong leadership; (6) appropriate instructional materials, methods, and approaches; (7) high expectations for student learning and behavior; (8) positive  school/classroom climate; (9) maximum use of academic learning time; (10) closely monitored student progress; (11) regular feedback and reinforcement; (12) excellence recognized and rewarded; and (13) evaluation results used for project improvement. The projects submitted evidence of achievement and gains. The profiles contain the following information: (1) name and address; (2) setting; (3) number of students; (4) grade levels; (5) curriculum; (6) per pupil cost; (7) indicators of success; and (8) attributes of success. These programs from the 1985-1986 school year scored high on the appropriateness of the instructional materials, their articulation with the regular school program, and parent/community involvement. A list of nominated and selected programs, a tabular profile index of  these programs, and a geographical index of them comprise the three appendices. (VM)",

        "description":"Resources in Education (RIE) is a monthly abstract journal that announces (catalogs, indexes, abstracts) documents of interest to the educational community (including researchers, teachers, students, school board members, school administrators, counselors, etc.). Each issue announces approximately 1,100 documents and provides indexes by Subject, Personal Author, Institution, Publication Type, and ERIC Clearinghouse Number. This special Computer Output Microfiche (COM) edition is prepared directly from the ERIC magnetic tape database prior to publication of the printed journal and therefore is lacking the cover and other regular introductory and advertising matter contained in the printed journal. The COM edition contains only the first three of the five indexes in the printed  edition. The first accession in each issue of RIE is the issue itself. In this way, the monthly microfiche collection for each issue is immediately preceded by a microfiche index to that collection. This practice began with the RIE issue for May 1979. (CRW/WTB)",

        "description":"This assessment of American education, carried out at the President's request, comes on the fifth anniversary of &quot;A Nation at Risk,&quot; the landmark 1983 study of the National Commission on Excellence in Education. In this report, the Secretary of Education evaluates the progress of education reform during the last five years and sets forth the critical tasks that remain to improve American education. While noting that promising changes already underway may eventually show results, the Secretary warns of &quot;bureaucratic inertia&quot; and &quot;those with a vested interest in the status quo,&quot; both of which may block worthwhile reforms. The report draws on advice from hundreds of individuals, a series of Education Department seminars on key topics of education reform, and on much research  sponsored by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) measuring what students study and what they learn. A study of transcripts, comparing the courses taken by 15,000 high school students in 1987 with a similar group in 1982, reveals significant improvement. Nearly 30% of 1987 students completed the English, mathematics, science, and social studies portions of the &quot;New Basics&quot; curriculum recommended in &quot;A Nation at Risk,&quot; compared with 13.4% in 1982. National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) advance data from forthcoming reports indicates that math and science performance by American students is generally improving, but it remains weak compared to students in other countries. Five key imperatives are presented as recommendations that &quot;should guide continued  reform of American education&quot;: (1) strengthen content throughout the curriculum; (2) ensure equal intellectual opportunity for every student; (3) establish an ethos of achievement in every school; (4) recruit and reward good teachers and principals; (5) institute accountability throughout the education system for student learning. A Press Release and a copy of the Secretary's remarks at a Press Conference announcing the report are appended. (WTB)",

It outlines the seven objectives established for the three-city test--job placements, exposure to the security profession, enhanced job skills, development of community partnerships, enrichment of school curriculum/experience, better-trained and more community-conscious security recruits, and student involvement in preventing crime. The report also draws lessons of interest to security professionals, employment specialists, youth workers, and educators. Lessons are grouped into subject areas: youth employment programs, youth development, community partnerships, versions of the program and  how they work, potential problems, and program costs. Investments and dividends are listed for these participants: student/employee, school and school leaders, employer, professionals, community leaders, and community funders. The report describes what happened at each site--Harbor City Learning Center, Baltimore; Shaw High School, Cleveland; and Vashon High School, St. Louis--as well as program-wide. A final section presents questions to help determine whether a community should actively pursue starting a SEEP program. (YLB)",

School-based child care programs are a positive way for educational institutions to encourage young mothers to return to or stay in school, prepare for employment, and acquire accurate information about child development and appropriate parenting practices. This handbook was designed to be a practical &quot;how-to&quot; guide for creating school-based child care centers. It leads the reader through all phases of the development process, including support strategies, staffing, program and policies, funding, and evaluation. In developing the handbook, staff from the Academy for Educational Development's Support Center for Educational Equity for Young Mothers conducted a thorough survey of the program history,  philosophy, and delivery arrangements in many school-based child care programs throughout the country. Six sites representing a diversity of settings and approaches were selected for intensive investigation, including in-depth interviews with key actors --motivators, innovators, strategists, program planners, care givers, and student parents. The guide describes how each center began, how it gained acceptance in the school community, and how it became an excellent program. It includes advice from those who have organized and operated such centers. An extensive list of additional resources makes up the final chapter. (KC)",

This monograph examines programs that develop the employment potential of those youth who are not likely to make it on their own. It first looks at the problem of youth unemployment and describes the components of employability--the skills, attitudes, and behaviors that make a young person ready for a job. The following three chapters describe some activities business, education, and government leaders have undertaken; provide examples of business-education partnerships; and draw on current research to provide recommendations for action. Suggestions are made to policymakers in education, business, and  government on contributions they can make in each of the four areas of employability development: basic skills, pre-employment competency, work maturity, and occupational skills. Activities to promote pre-employment competency and work maturity are combined in the discussion, as they are in many youth programs. The recommendations at the end of each chapter are intended to guide the way toward more effective strategies to prepare youth for work. A bibliography is appended. (YLB)",

The survey data consisted of copies of vocational teacher certification requirements and telephone interviews with representatives from the state departments of education in the following states: Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Certification requirements and professional development practices varied widely from state to state. Mandatory in-trade experience requirements ranged from one year or less to a maximum of five years, and 9 of the  16 states performed no mandatory technical testing, relying instead on work experience as the sole criterion for determining adequate technical competence. Only four states had mandatory written and practical examinations to validate applicants' technical skills. In 9 of the 16 states, one basic course (3-9 semester hours) was required for initial certification, and only 2 states had what could be termed extensive academic requirements. Four states required virtually no higher education even for permanent certification, although 7 required approximately 60 semester hours and 2 required a baccalaureate degree. These results were practically the same as those of a study conducted nearly a decade ago. (MN)",

        "description":"A study compared the barriers to employment facing handicapped persons in Israel and the United States. Five vocational rehabilitation centers (two in the United States and three in Israel) were examined. Each was studied in terms of the type of center, population served, goals, nature and scope of services provided, sources of income, staff and staffing patterns, organizational structure, architectural accessibility, geographical area served, local labor market conditions, and business and industrial bases in the area. Greater variation was found among the centers in each country than between the countries with respect to stated rehabilitation goals, nature and scope of services provided, and staff-to-client ratios. Centers were 100 percent government-supported in Israel but  only 59-90 percent government-supported in the United States. A greater proportion of the clients served in the U.S. were mentally retarded, whereas the Israeli centers served a greater proportion of physically disabled clients. A pyramid structure was more evident in the U.S. centers as were unemployment problems in the areas surrounding the centers. Considerable differences in opinion concerning the most important outcomes of vocational rehabilitation were evident. The three most important outcomes identified in the United States were competitive employment, stable employment (sheltered or competitive), and increases in total income, whereas improved independent living, increased wages, and increased job satisfaction were the three most important outcomes identified in the Israeli  centers.

Systematic delivery is advantageous because of its developmental emphasis, effective use of resources, amenability to change, provisions for built-in ongoing evaluation, and focus on process and product. A comprehensive adult career counseling delivery system includes the following components: needs assessment, resource assessment, goal setting, planning, establishment of specific objectives, program development, implementation, evaluation, and modification. Vetter et. al. (1986) have developed a six-point interactive model for adult career counseling programs. The model provides for intake (obtaining formal information about the client and establishing a foundation for  the counseling relationship); formal assessment (analyzing clients' strengths, weaknesses, attitudes, values, and interests with enough flexibilty to address the needs of special populations); exploration and information gathering (to identify and clarify work values, interests, and skills and to facilitate exploration of specific occupations); decision making (identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives); planning (translating the information gathered in the preceding stages into action); and transition (entry into a training program, education program, or job). Care must also be taken address the special career planning needs of dislocated workers, displaced homemakers, long-term unemployed persons, limited-English proficient individuals, adults with disabilities, incarcerated  persons, and older workers.

        "description":"Because of their special ties to the community, community-based organizations (CBOs) are often able to be more responsive to the needs of local or special populations than can mainstream institutions such as schools and government-funded employment services. CBOs such as Service Employment Redevelopment (SER), the National Urban League, and Operation Mainstream have been especially effective in working with disabled, disadvantaged, minority, and limited-English speaking individuals. Despite their advantages, most CBOs are not in a position to provide the highest-quality vocational programs on their own--hence the need for collaboration between CBOs and vocational education. A wide array of partnerships are possible, depending on such factors as the size and resources of the CBO  in question, its target clientele, its overall goals, and the types and extent of services that it has developed on its own. Possible foci for partnerships between a CBO and vocational education include vocational orientation and counseling, remedial education, career education in an alternative high school setting, employment and work experience programs, and combined/comprehensive programs. The barriers that have been found to interfere with some CBO/vocational education partnerships, such as &quot;turf&quot; problems, unwillingness to expend funds for services that another agency can provide, and interagency competition for clients, can often be overcome by careful preliminary planning and face-to-face meetings between the collaborating parties to foster an understanding of each other's goals  and concerns and to develop mutually suitable goals and strategies. The Opportunities Academy of Management Training has developed a 12-point plan for establishing local partnerships and a 7-point plan for establishing state partnerships. (MN)",

        "description":"Being an effective vocational teacher today means having knowledge and/or experience in four areas: a specific skill area; instructional planning, implementation, and evaluation; classroom and laboratory management; and occupational experience. Tomorrow's vocational teachers will need to be competent in all of these areas, but they will also need to develop skills in areas that may seem distant from their primary teaching duties. The need to help students develop employability skills and higher-order thinking skills is becoming more evident. Vocational teachers will be called upon with increasing frequency to address individual needs in their classroom. Teachers will have to manage experiential learning programs, both in and out of the classroom. Teachers will likely be expected  to become more involved in public relations work, and they will face increasing demands from the standpoint of keeping up to date in their specialties and professional development. The Holmes Group report, &quot;Tomorrow's Teachers,&quot; and the Carnegie Forum report, &quot;A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century,&quot; have outlined similar proposals for reforming teacher education. Many of these proposals (for example, creating a national board of standards and relating teacher incentives to student performance) have raised serious debate. Regardless of the outcome, it is likely that change in vocational teacher education will come about, not only because of the reform reports but also because of other pressures within the education community. The final effects of the reform movement will likely  be felt in the next decade. (MN)",

The handbook is based on information derived from a project that involved a literature search, a pilot study in which some major tests were administered to adult students, observations and interviews with students and teachers in adult education classrooms in the San Antonio area, a statewide survey of all adult education programs in Texas, and presentations at regional meetings of adult educators. The handbook presents a comprehensive assessment model for adult education, appropriate  techniques for interpreting assessment results and for developing teacher-made assessments, and assessment resources, including tests currently used by adult educators throughout the state. Specific topics covered by the model include developing measurable objectives, developing test specifications and items, interpreting and using assessments, adult basic education, English as a second language, General Educational Development, competency-based high school, and other education settings.

The book contains five chapters. Each chapter addresses a particular aspect of providing these services: surveying needs, identifying barriers, defining strategies, developing interagency coordination, and putting it all together in an appropriate, workable, community-based plan. At the end of each chapter, a worksheet is provided for completing suggested tasks. Readers are encouraged to use the worksheets to address needs, barriers, and strategies that reflect the local ABE program. This learn-by-doing approach  is designed to result in an implementation plan, unique to the local program, that addresses the provision of support services to ABE students.

The paper concludes that there is a close relationship between the aims and methods of adult education and the view of humans as independent in their search for solutions to problems. Adult education is assumed to attract mature people intent on personal, intellectual, and professional development in the direction of autonomy. The study content, the institutional forms, and the methods usually applied are intended to pave the way for this development. The maturity of participants in adult education would seem to strengthen the assumptions that adult  students are--or can be--particularly capable of independent study. This maturity, the conversational methods developed, and the very ethos of adult education make it reasonable to expect of adult study particular potentials for developing independent personalities. This expectation and knowledge of the general motivation of voluntary, mature learners make lifelong learning a realistic proposition for considerable numbers of people to whom study opportunities are continuously available.

Topics covered include the concept and academic discipline of adult education, theoretical attempts to delineate the academic discipline of adult education, university study of adult education, and a comparison of plans and reality in the field of adult education. The paper concludes that adult education is the designation of any educational activity with which earlier educational activities are continued, thus including literacy programs and similar work in developing parts of the world with adults who have had no formal schooling, but have profited from other types of education. Adult education as almost universally understood today is concerned with liberal arts, languages, science, technology,  and occupational subjects. Various methods and media are applied to adult education, among them primarily those of group learning and distance education. These activities are being investigated at many universities within the framework of the academic discipline of adult education. University curricula for adult education have become common. Their core is adult learning, and their target subjects include the life conditions of adult students, analysis of educational and training needs, counseling, curricular studies, and methodologies.

        "description":"This article focuses on the linkage between the quantitative and qualitative distance education research methods. The concept that serves as the conceptual link is termed &quot;complementarity.&quot; The definition of complementarity emerges through a simulated study of FernUniversitat's mentors. The study shows that in the case of the mentors, educational phenomena are approached from several points of view rather than from a viewpoint where one perspective excludes another. Because of the interrelationship between everyday reality (qualitative) and reconstructed reality (quantitative) research, a conceptual linkage is required that displays the fruitfulness, yet philosophical and theoretical faithfulness, of interrelating the qualitative and quantitative research procedures. To this end,  complementarity is proposed. Complementarity aids the development of a holistic portrayal of mentors while retaining acceptable philosophical, theoretical, and ethical standards. It contributes to a more faithful interpretation within the context of the program in use, and it allows for recommendations that focus on a complement of quantitative and qualitative methodologies.

Developers' acts, plans, beliefs, expectations, values, and assumptions about the state, education, society, and humankind act as a life lens through which the developers envision the conceptualization, plan, organization, and development of distance education materials and programs. Care must be taken to assess the appropriateness of program developers' perspectives when materials are used by students in a foreign land or culture and to  assess the implications of transferring distance education programs to other cultures. Materials and programs may be developed from a variety of perspectives, including the common sense, technological, theoretic, political, mythical, and illusionary perspectives. When interpreting a program perspective, an analyst can never know the meaning of an object or an act as it is experienced by someone else. With this in mind, developers must carefully analyze their materials and programs to be sure that their impact in a foreign culture will be the one desired. Some of the issues that must be addressed include how the user will interpret any metaphors used, whether the underlying intents of the program or materials will be understandable to the user, whether the implied relationship between  teacher and student is the one intended, the ethical implications of the text's descriptions and prescriptions, and the manner in which the program incorporates student input.

        "author":["Holmberg, Borje"],
        "description":"This paper begins by contrasting theories of teaching (which are predictive) to theories of learning (which are descriptive). It justifies the feasibility theory of distance teaching by asserting that methods of distance teaching can affect the pace and direction of learning; therefore, it should be feasible to develop a theory of distance teaching. After a caution that it is impossible to develop a theory of distance teaching that is universally applicable to all students, all conditions, and all subject areas, a prescriptive theory of distance teaching is outlined. The theory asserts that distance teaching will support student motivation and promote learning pleasure and effectiveness if it is provided in such a way that (1) students believe that the subject of study is  relevant to their individual needs, (2) students are made to feel a sense of rapport with the distance education institution, (3) access to course content is facilitated, (4) learners are engaged in discussions and decisions, and (5) the program provides for real and simulated communication to and from the learner. Eleven strategies that are favorable to distance teaching and thus facilitative of distance learning are postulated. These include involving students in the selection and evaluation of course goals, using course materials that are characterized by a conversation style and highly readable, selecting instructional media on the basis of individual student needs and the requirements of the subject area being studied, handling assignments quickly, making assignments that require  students to solve problems or make decisions, and providing self-checking exercises. The paper concludes with 11 hypotheses that can be tested to assess the validity of the proposed theory. A 40-item reference list concludes the document. (MN)",

        "description":"Educational theorists frequently use the term \"model\" to denote a simplified picture of the reality of a theoretical approach or a school of thought. In branches of empirical science, including education, experimental data are often correlated with mathematical symbols, which makes it possible to interconnect these symbols in an exact way. Models can be used to explain causal relationships or to test hypotheses and theories. Although models present simplified pictures of reality, they are seldom exclusively descriptive; rather, they tend to show causal relations and clarify which variables in a given system are dependent and which are independent. Other types of models that have been used in writings about education are the hierarchical model and the algorithm-type model. Another  type of simplifying model is one that aims at delineating concepts and areas of research. In many cases, the dividing line between an argumentative outline of a theory (or description) and a model is far from clear. Educational theorists have relied on both functional and normative models. Some of these represent positions within a philosophy of education leading to explicit concerns about ideological issues. On the other hand, they aim at guiding the teaching-learning process and thus develop various schemes that systematize the concepts that are important to them. The difference between functional and normative educational models may be viewed in terms of contrasting attempts to separate scholarship from value judgments and attempts at normative pedagogy.

        "author":["Perraton, Hilary"],
        "description":"Distance education can be examined in three ways. It can be analyzed from the standpoint of its teaching, administrative, and assessment systems. The three systems are interrelated, and examining each of them--first in isolation and then in conjunction with the other two--can provide a coherence that is useful in teaching and improving distance education programs. Evaluations of distance education teaching systems should begin with an examination of the general theoretical statements that have been made about distance education. Focus should be on the role of various media in teaching at a distance, the significance of two-way communication, and the effect that presentational devices within texts and a coherent structure of the subject content have on the effectiveness of a  distance education program. Although such theoretical statements are too general to be of great practical value, they suggest a way in which narrower (and more useful) dependent theories can be developed from them. When the administrative system of a distance education program is evaluated, generalizations can be drawn from practice that may offer useful heuristics and may thus, in time, serve as the basis for administrative theories. Distance teaching institutions may be classified in terms of their governing structure and functions. The system for assessing a distance education system must include value judgments about educational quality and indicators of that quality. A 46-item reference list concludes the document. (MN)",

It describes a systematic preventive approach to hazardous chemicals that is based on the following steps: determining which chemicals are in use at a particular worksite (techniques for asking the company and steps to take if the company is unwilling to cooperate); identifying the short- and long-term health effects of different chemicals; assessing the seriousness of exposure (solid, liquid, and gaseous chemicals; ways in which chemicals enter the body; ways of determining how much exposure employees are receiving, and ways of identifying patterns of illness); methods of controlling exposure (control methods, personal protective equipment, and Occupational Safety and Health  Administration [OSHA] policy on personal protective equipment). Appendixes include a chemical hazard inspection checklist, a table of glove permeability, a form for use in requesting that a company supply information under OSHA, and comments on the degree of protection afforded by OSHA standards.

It presented early evidence of successful use of two sets of vocational education resource materials in 12 demonstration sites, 6 for each resource. The materials were \"BASICS: Bridging Vocational and Academic Skills,\" which helps teachers provide students with the basic skills needed by today's work force, and \"CONNECTIONS: School and Work Transitions,\" which helps ease the problems involved in the transition from school to work. Data were collected by a preimplementation survey of participants at an orientation workshop, telephone interviews with each site coordinator, and a survey of users after adoption of materials. Findings  indicated that research-based vocational education resources offer how-to-do-it frameworks of ideas for teachers; help to defuse objections of staff and school boards who are resistant to change; set the climate for change; reinforce activities that teachers already do; and increase the credibility of a learning activity with students. Successful implementation called for extensive time and effort devoted to key activities and for ongoing support from administrators and educational leaders. (YLB)",

The reviews of the research literature that compare the learning effectiveness of different delivery media tend to support the position that in learning, the medium itself is not the critical factor. The bulk of the research indicates that maintenance training can be effectively delivered with actual equipment trainers, 3-D simulation, and computer-based instruction. The investigation focused on videodisk delivery systems and found that they are at least as effective as other training media. Although reported costs for methods of training vary widely, videodisk systems can be cost-effective.  The cost of acquisition of videodisk delivery systems is offset by the savings in delivery costs. The study concluded that computer-controlled videodisks can be effective in delivering maintenance training and simulation. Because of the elimination of instructors and the reduced training time required to complete coursework, videodisks provide the most cost-effective delivery method for hands-on mechanic training and verification testing. Following a comparison of various training models, simulation testing was recommended to test, certify, and license mechanics in California. (KC)",

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analyses of variance, and T-tests. The study found that the state staff was rated most highly on the quality of the working relationship between state staff and teachers, whereas they received the lowest mean rating on their efforts in helping teachers improve the quality of their teaching. The university  faculty were rated highest on usefulness of workshops offered and lowest on opportunity for agriculture teachers to have input in faculty agriculture education policies. State supervisors were rated significantly higher than teacher educators on four areas: how well they represent vocational agriculture to those outside the profession, quality of working relationship, quality of communications, and opportunity for teacher input. Teacher educators were rated more positively by those who had received the most visits from them.

Leading factors for seniors in selecting a career were interest in the work, working conditions, salary/wages, and personal satisfaction. The differences in responses among the students who were categorized according to  vocational program experience indicated that a uniqueness exists in the career decision-making patterns of vocational students. Little relationship, if any, or a low positive relationship existed between years in a specific vocational program and whether that vocational teacher had an effect on the student's career decisions.

It has been active in developing instructional technology that teaches intellectual skills, cognitive strategies, the affective domain, or motor skills in addition to presenting information. In its 1985 instructional video production \"Math Works,\" students are taught to use cognitive strategies, such as critical thinking, to manage their own learning processes by watching peers cope successfully with a difficult math problem. AIT's 2-year program \"Principles  of Technology\" uses 6 different learning situations to teach applied physics to vocational and technical students. It contains 1,500 pages of text, 72 video programs, 90 laboratory sessions, mathematics exercises, classroom presentations, and teacher/student interaction. All materials produced by the agency are evaluated by teachers and other subject matter experts. AIT funds curriculum design and program production by forming consortia of interested state and provincial educational agencies in the United States and Canada. AIT is also actively seeking mutually beneficial curricula-sharing projects around the world and has worked with geographers and television crews in 14 countries to produce a program entitled \"Global Geography.\" Materials intended for use outside the United States are  translated, correlated to foreign texts, and adapted to the culture in which they will be used; the videotapes on which the materials are recorded are subjected to various technical conversions. \"Principles of Technology\" is being adapted for use in Bophuphatswana, Mexico, and Turkey, and \"Math Works\" is currently being adapted for use in Israel.

The first investigation addressed the differences in the knowledge base that troubleshooters bring to a problem. A group of five novice troubleshooters and five experts was given electric generator sets to repair. The results showed that experts have a much greater depth of understanding of the basic principles and concepts that underlie the operation of generator sets. Experts can also comprehend the function and operation of the generator system, whereas the novices seem to lack an accurate mental model of the operation of the technical systems they repair daily. The second investigation attempted to identify  differences in the actual troubleshooting performance of the expert and novice service technicians. In this test, the subjects were instructed to &quot;think aloud&quot; as they worked through a problem with either a faulty fuel pump or an open wire. The primary difference between the troubleshooting performance of the experts and the novices was that the experts were able to select better information and generate better hypotheses, probably because they have more knowledge and their knowledge is organized more effectively. The results of this study can be used to design training programs to reduce the differences between expert and novice technical troubleshooters. (KC)",

        "description":"It has been suggested that a lack of assertiveness may be an important component of the psychological make-up of bulimic women, and that bulimic women may experience particular difficulties in asserting themselves in interactions with men. In this study, 23 women reporting the symptoms of bulimia by high scores on the Bulimia Test (BULIT) and 21 women reporting low BULIT scorers completed several self-report scales, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before interacting with either a male or a female confederate who made five increasingly demanding requests. In vivo interactions were videotaped and tapes were rated for behavior by a rater blind to subjects' BULIT scores. The results revealed that, compared to low scorers, high scorers on the BULIT obtained significantly  higher scores on the BDI, displayed significantly shorter latencies of response to the confederate's requests, and manifested significantly lower overall verbal assertiveness in response to confederate's requests. Compared to other conditions, a disproportionate number of high scorers complied with all requests of the male confederate. (Author/NB)",

In his opening statement, Representative John Conyers, Jr. presents statistics which attest to a rise in antigay violence since the murders of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1979. He notes that there are currently no federal statutes which specifically prohibit antigay violence and stresses the need for this hearing to examine the level of violence being directed toward homosexuals and to determine what needs to be done about it.

        "author":["Basow, Susan A."],
        "description":"Student ratings of college professors play an important role in many employment decisions. One factor strongly associated with student ratings is teacher expressiveness. A study was conducted to explore the effects of teacher expressiveness, teacher sex, and student sex on student ratings of their instructor, student perceptions of their instructor's gender-linked characteristics, and on student achievement. Forty male and 40 female undergraduate students viewed a videotape of either a male or female instructor acting either expressively or nonexpressively. Students then completed a student rating form, the short form of the Bem Sex Role Inventory to rate the instructor's personality, and a short multiple-choice test on lecture content. The results revealed that expressive  instructors received the most positive student ratings on all measures, although expressiveness interacted with teacher sex on the rating of scholarship such that the expressive male instructor was rated the lowest. Expressiveness also interacted with both teacher sex and student sex on achievement scores. Student-perceived teacher sex-typing may partially explain the effect of expressiveness on student ratings.

        "description":"Research has suggested the utility of studying individual differences in the regulation of negative mood states. Generalized response expectancies for negative mood regulation were defined as expectancies that some overt behavior or cognition would alleviate negative mood states as they occur across situations. The Generalized Expectancy for Negative Mood Regulation Scale (NMR) was developed to measure this dimension. To examine the scale's internal consistency and discriminant validity from social desirability and locus of control, the NMR, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and the Internal-External Control of Reinforcement Scale were administered to 789 college students. The results demonstrated internal consistency and discriminant validity for 30 items from a  50-item pool. In a second study using another sample (N=162), the NMR correlated negatively with the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, indicating that subjects who reported a strong belief that they can regulate negative moods were less depressed than subjects who reported a weaker generalized expectancy. These results have implications for the understanding of stress and coping processes and the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety and affective disorders. (Author/NB)",

Zabin); (4) the Too Early Childbearing (TEC) Network (Anita Mitchell); (5) an array of interventions (Cheryl Davis Hayes); (6) comprehensive programming (Lorraine Klerman); and (7) Project Redirection (Barbara Blum). The state experience is examined by Linda  Reivitz (Wisconsin), Agnes M. Mansour (Michigan), Gregory L. Coler (Illinois), and Cesar A. Perales (New York). Three workshops are described which were organized in the areas of Ethical Issues and Concepts (Linda A. Wolf), Interagency Coordination (Robert Fulton), and Media Relations (Clifton H. Jolley). The final section of the document presents conference recommendations for what the states, the American Public Welfare Association, and others can do to combat the issue of adolescent pregnancy.

        "description":"Theory and research on the processes of early social learning in children has indicated that television and television commercials play an important role in children's internalization of cultural meanings, interpretations, and values, whether or not the commercials children see are intended for or directed at them. Between the ages of 2 and 18, the period in which social learning is most intense, American children see approximately 100,000 television commercials for beer. This study examined the cultural myths and messages present in a sample of 40 commercials representing 15 brands of beer which were broadcast on network television during 22 weekend daytime and evening hours in February and March of 1987. The relationships among beer, masculinity, and driving represented in the  commercials were analyzed. The results of these analyses suggest that beer commercials promote not only a particular stereotypical view of what it means to be a man, but they also promote an association between drinking and driving. This association reflects and propagates values and attitudes implicated in drunk driving. Based on the conclusions of this research, it is recommended that the policy permitting the televising of commercials for beer be revised to prohibit such commercials. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Inconsistent use of contraceptives or discontinuance of family planning services places women at risk of unintended pregnancies. Dropping out of family planning clinics also could mean interrupting gynecological care. Nonetheless, approximately 20% of adolescent family planning patients and nearly 25% of adult patients do not return for a second visit. This study examined reasons for clinic discontinuance by conducting telephone surveys of 628 women more than 2 years after their last clinic visit at one of 62 clinics. Two reasons cited most frequently by respondents were dissatisfaction with the clinic care and the inconvenience of the clinic's hours, location, or transportation. Relationships were found between reasons for discontinuation and the individual covariables of age,  years of education, income, use of public assistance, and number of live births. Relationships were found between reasons for discontinuation and the clinic covariables of number of different staff seen by a patient, seeing the same medical care provider, convenience to public transportation, and number of visits by patients with incomes less than 150% of poverty level. During the period following clinic discontinuation, 89% of the women went to another place to get gynecological care or a pelvic examination and 35% went specifically to get family planning services. These findings have both programmatic and policy implications. (NB)",

Section IV reviews the chronology of the attempted dismantling of the Medicare Home Health Benefit. Section V presents the results of the survey to all home health agencies in the United States. Section VI  provides evidence of the cost effectiveness of home care. Section VII gives the results of a national opinion survey measuring public attitudes toward home care. Section VIII lists reasons in favor of home care, section IX contains a summary and conclusions, and section X gives 20 recommendations. The contention of the report is that the administrative restrictions placed on home care providers are punitive and designed to restrict the statutory Medicare benefit, to force providers out of business, or to force them to subsidize Medicare with revenues raised from private contributions of Medicare patients.

Experts interviewed by the GAO generally concurred with the priorities reflected in the administration's AIDS prevention budget for fiscal year 1988, targeting three areas for immediate action: (1) containing the spread of AIDS virus among intravenous drug users and their sexual partners; (2) educating targeted high-risk groups and the general population about AIDS and AIDS prevention; and (3)  expanding voluntary testing with pretest and posttest counseling services. While agreeing with administration priorities, experts considered budget proposals to be inadequate. Respondents also suggested a full-scale federally coordinated campaign against AIDS, the simultaneous launching of several approaches to prevention education with evaluation of program effectiveness required, and education of low-risk groups to assure these groups remain uninfected by the AIDS virus.

        "description":"The Veterans Administration (VA) established the Readjustment Counseling Program in 1980 to assist Vietnam era veterans who had not made a successful psychosocial adjustment to civilian life. The program was intended to make services available at vet centers for veterans reluctant to seek counseling from regular VA health care facilities. At the request of Senator Frank Murkowski, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed specific aspects of the Readjustment Counseling Program to: (1) evaluate the need for retaining vet centers in community-based settings; (2) provide information on characteristics and problems of clients, services provided, staffing, and vet center relations with other agencies and the community; and (3) assess program management, oversight, and  recordkeeping. Based on findings of the study, the GAO recommended that the VA should be able to decide on a case-by-case basis whether vet centers should be relocated to existing VA facilities. Clients were found to have motivational or behavioral problems. Centers were found to offer individual and group counseling and employment and VA benefits assistance. The centers had established extensive community networks for outreach and referrals. Most staff members had relevant academic, military, and professional experience. Improved monitoring of centers' activities was considered necessary to help ensure the provision of quality care.

        "description":"Gordon Allport believed that one could learn about the content and structure of people's personalities by looking at their expressive movements. While his expectations were not absolute, he did believe that different expressive behaviors were consistent with each other, and that any given expressive behavior, for a particular individual, would be consistent across time and across situations. An important development in the study of expressive behavior is found in the literature on the deliberate regulation and control of expressive behaviors. This impression management perspective can be seen as complementary to, rather than competitive with, Allport's ideas about unselfconscious expressiveness. Several points can be made regarding the deliberate regulation of expressive  behaviors: (1) it may well occur quite frequently; (2) it can ruin expressive consistency; (3) it can enhance expressive consistency; (4) attempts at deliberate regulation are not always successful; and (5) the impression management perspective on expressive behaviors suggests a different way of conceptualizing such behaviors. Allport saw much to be learned about expressive behaviors, especially facial behaviors, and he outlined six questions which might guide the scientific study of the face. Researchers have made various attempts to study these areas, and the issue of accuracy of personality perception has recently resurfaced at both the theoretical and the methodological levels. (NB)",

A study was conducted to examine the relationship of ambivalence over emotional expression to psychological and physical well-being through the &quot;personal striving&quot; framework. Measures of ambivalence over expression, actual expressiveness, and psychological and physical well-being were administered to 75 undergraduate students. A separate group of 48 subjects completed daily mood and symptom reports for 3 weeks. Ambivalence over expressing was positively related to measures of negative affectivity, and negatively related to life satisfaction. Ambivalence scores were also significantly correlated with several of the ill-being  measures, including daily reported physical symptoms. Actual expressiveness showed weaker relationships with the criterion measures. The findings suggest the importance of conflict in the expression of emotion as a factor in the development of symptomatology which has been traditionally associated with emotional inhibition.

A section on neuropsychiatric dimensions of AIDS infection explores the range of psychological suffering experienced by persons with AIDS and explains involvement of the central nervous system in the disease. A section on treating patients with AIDS or related conditions discusses needs of patients which go beyond medical care and suggests referrals to various service groups. Treatment considerations are presented for patients with AIDS and for patients who have  tested positive for HTLV-III antibody or who have AIDS-related complex. Support groups and mental health referrals are discussed. The next section looks at the needs of health professionals who work with AIDS patients.

The National Institute of Mental Health has worked to remove the stigma associated with mental illness and research has unraveled many of the mysteries about the origins of mental illness. Deinstitutionalization, while providing freedom to the mentally ill, can also present them with an unsympathetic, unfair, and hostile society. Although public attitudes toward the mentally ill have changed, people continue to discriminate against them. One reason for this discrimination may be that people fear the mentally ill and consider them unpredictable. The vast majority of mentally ill persons are not dangerous. The communications media, by stressing a  history of mental illness in news stories or by stereotyping mentally ill persons as violent and dangerous in dramatic programs, may have perpetuated the public fear of the mentally ill. The media have a responsibility to provide a broader perspective on the mentally ill. Research has shown that negative and stigmatizing images of mental patients can be altered and there are several encouraging signs of greater public understanding and acceptance of mental illness. Many mentally ill persons, if given help, can recover fully enough to live productive and satisfying lives. (NB)",

        "description":"In response to a request by Congressman Claude Pepper, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a study to examine the private long-term care insurance market. The GAO analyzed the premiums, benefits, and limitations of 33 policies offered by 25 insurers in 1986. The GAO assessed the potential for abuse in this market by surveying state insurance commissioners in 26 states, interviewing officials with consumer advocacy groups, and reviewing consumer guides in the long-term care insurance literature. The results revealed that the 33 policies offered a broad range of indemnity payments. There was considerable variation in the indemnity benefit amounts available, in the premiums charged, and in the duration of benefits. Many of the policies offered a broad range of long-term  care benefits, providing benefits for different levels of care and giving consumers a choice of waiting period. Some policy clauses limited the use of benefits. Premium costs generally varied depending on age, daily indemnity benefit amounts, duration of benefits, and length of waiting periods. About 70% of the policies were guaranteed renewable. The potential for abuse was believed to exist and, although several states have established programs to guard against abusive marketing practices, Congress may want to consider federal legislation to reduce potential abuse in marketing.

These include the following: (1) going to the bereaved student's home the night before the funeral; (2) making sure proper arrangements have been made; (3) making sure someone has explained what is expected of the student at the funeral and shivah; (4) knowing the protocol for calling on the avel and reassuring the student that he/she need not worry about missed schoolwork; (5) ensuring that a friend of the student's will be with him or her; (6) leaving a telephone number and making available for the family certain books on death and mourning;  (7) ensuring that arrangements have been made for the avel's classmates to attend the funeral; (8) preparing the class by discussing their feelings; (9) being aware that some friends of the avel may need counseling; (10) arranging for some formal group expression of condolence; (11) remembering that additional counseling may be needed after the shivah; and (12) considering a special learning project as a means of further involving students and identifying with the avel. Special points to consider when reacting to death in the family of an elementary school student are discussed. Four questions in a quick checklist and a note on the value of a competent counselor conclude the pamphlet. (ABL)",

        "description":"The topic of procrastination (putting off for tomorrow what one should do today) is introduced as a well-known phenomenon that has been the subject of widespread general interest, modest professional activity, and remarkably little research interest. In this paper, explicit criteria are formulated to define the phenomenon. The various etiological and treatment perspectives (psychodynamic, behaviorist, and cognitive) are described. Distinctions are made between internal versus external locus of avoidant responses and between positive versus negative task valence. Internal locus of avoidant responses refers to intrapersonal characteristics that activate avoidant responses with regard to tasks or decisions, while external locus of avoidant responses refers to task or decision  characteristics that elicit these avoidant responses. Positive task valence is defined as an effort to succeed, to complete a task or reach a decision satisfactorily, and negative task valence is defined as an effort to court failure. Procrastination is discussed in relation to broad concepts in the field of stress and coping. The paper concludes that procrastination is more than a curious human aberration; it represents a dysfunction of important human abilities to establish priorities and the ability to perform these tasks in a conflict-free, efficient manner.

        "description":"Adolescent substance abuse is a leading problem in schools today. If prevention efforts by schools are to be effective, needs assessment and evaluation must be integral parts of the process. A comprehensive needs assessment of school substance abuse prevention programs in the western United States was conducted to: (1) describe the degree and patterns of adolescent substance abuse; (2) describe local and state prevention programs and activities; (3) identify the technical assistance needs of schools, state agencies, and higher education institutions; and (4) identify barriers to providing regional technical assistance. The assessment revealed that adolescent drug use was a critical problem that has existed for many years, cutting across geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic  boundaries and starting as early as the elementary grades. Nearly all schools were involved in prevention and intervention activities although few had a comprehensive program. State agencies had conducted student use surveys, provided dissemination and training, and were involved in fragile partnerships with other state agencies. State coordinators claimed they would welcome a regional technical assistance center. Institutions of higher education generally did not have teacher training programs in substance abuse prevention or intervention, nor did they pursue federal funding for cooperative prevention programs with schools. Concerning evaluation and dissemination, the assessment found that service providers, training opportunities, prevention curricula, and model programs were not fully  utilized and most district programs had not been evaluated. The assessment identified several barriers to technical assistance. A reference list is included. (ABL)",

        "description":"This report proposes a planning model for successful drug-free schools based on the idea that the problems of drug-abusing youth are not solely the responsibility of the school but are the responsibilities of both the schools and community institutions. It notes that the process of planning for drug-free schools will require the school to identify a team of committed and interested staff, and that strong district leadership, commitment, and support for the team process is a necessary foundation. It advocates school activities being integrated with community activities and school personnel being joined by representatives from the community, such as substance abuse treatment institutions; enforcement agencies; and social, political, and religious organizations. The five phases of  the planning model discussed are: (1) needs assessment and planning the information base; (2) planning the implementation; (3) implementation of school programs; (4) evaluation of school programs; and (5) dissemination of school progress. This five-phase comprehensive planning model describes both the process and the content for a comprehensive prevention and intervention strategy for schools and communities. The report concludes that schools will benefit from the time invested in planning, needs identification, and goal setting which will result in programs appropriate for the school and community; and that ongoing evaluation and dissemination will ensure effective, targeted, and publicly supported programs to achieve drug-free schools.

The consequences of caring for victims include emotional, physical, and familial strain as the caregiver is faced with the progressive psychological deterioration of the victim. This study examined three levels of variables hypothesized to be related to distress and adaptation among caregivers of victims of Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder. These are: (1) intrapersonal variables; (2) interpersonal variables; and (3) support from the wider social network. Subjects were 85 female caregivers of non-institutionalized dementia patients, nearly all of whom were spouses or  daughters of the victim. Results showed no significant relationships between caregiver age, family status, socioeconomic status, employment, and distress. Coping style was related to health, appraisal, family support, and distress. The quality of the caregiver-patient relationship was significantly associated with health, coping, and distress. Qualitative variables were more predictive of distress than were quantitative variables. The majority of the variance in distress was accounted for by the use of avoidant coping strategies, followed by caregiver health and family support. Eighty-nine references are provided.

Recent research suggests that judgment and choice are indeed not the same, and that the processes evoked by each differ radically. Using information search boards, this study followed the disclosure patterns of 52 undergraduate college students who were asked to either choose a hypothetical roommate, or make judgments on each roommate alternative. One-half of each group (choice and judgment) were randomly assigned to select either a roommate for themselves (personal relevance) or for a friend (non-personal relevance). Under non-personal relevance, the decision process for conditions of judgment versus choice was predicted to involve more  information searched, less variability of the pattern of search, and greater use of interdimensional strategies. High relevance was predicted to attenuate these patterns. Analysis confirmed the predicted patterns for judgments as compared to choice. Unlike previous research, personal relevance yielded more intradimensional search patterns. (Author/ABL)",

An overview of regressive adaptation focuses on expressions of anger; depression and despair; rigidity; alcohol, sex, and drugs; envy; adolescent self-centeredness; and adolescent lack of appreciation. Stages of family life are described, with attention to the individual within the family, the family life cycle, the family system, the midlife stage of family development, loss of self, triangulation, adolescent pressure to achieve, family negotiation, and sibling influences. Sources of  dysfunctional family patterns are considered, including parental needs, negative attitudes toward change, unresolved separation issues, responses to adolescent behavior, and views of common problems. A section on facilitating adolescent growth examines helping relationships outside the family, idealization of significant others, parental resistance to help, transference reactions to a counselor, appropriate responses to adolescents in conflict, and family history. The monograph concludes that helping adults need to understand the authority and control conflicts of adolescent development, the conflicts and dynamics of the adolescent's family, and the influences of social and cultural affiliations.

A profile of a potential suicide attempter is presented, and issues of behavioral indications, verbal cues, motivations and cognitive distortions, depression, and personality traits are discussed. The rationale for choosing a cognitive-behavioral approach to counseling aimed at preventing adolescent suicide is given and six intervention strategies are suggested. Six components of school-based suicide prevention programs which must be in place for the adolescent at-risk population are identified: (1) district and building level administrative support; (2) faculty/staff  inservice on the topic of adolescent suicide; (3) parent education on adolescent suicide; (4) classroom presentations for all adolescents; (5) preparation of core teams; and (6) options for individual and group counseling. Crisis management is considered and questions useful in assessing lethality are posed. Crisis management interventions are discussed, postvention is described, and follow-up counseling or therapy is recommended.

Subjects' facial and gestural responses were videotaped. Later, and with their permission, the videotaped sequences were observed by the same Chinese students and also by 20 American students who attempted to determine the kind of slide presented from the facial/gestural reactions. Results indicated that the sex difference in sending accuracy usually found in Western  students (with females being more expressive) did not occur in Chinese students. The usual finding of female superiority in receiving ability was, however, also found in the Chinese subjects. The students from Taiwan showed significantly greater sending accuracy than did students from the PRC, but there was no difference in receiving ability between these groups. There was no evidence that communication within a culture or group is more efficient than communication between cultures or groups in this data, and there was no evidence that cultural contact enhances spontaneous communication.

        "description":"To evaluate the 1987 Compensatory Language Experiences and Reading (CLEAR)-Reading Recovery Summer Project undertaken in the Columbus, Ohio Public Schools, data on reading improvement of 59 first grade pupils from Douglas Alternative School were collected. The objective of the 5-week, 3-hour-per-day-program was to give students enough instruction to allow them to be moved from the CLEAR project to normal classroom settings without further individualized help. A total of 12 teachers were involved in the Summer Project, which featured 30-minute, one-on-one lessons during which pupils were engaged in a variety of instructional activities, such as reading and rereading books, writing and reading their own stories, and analyzing letters and sounds in words. The remainder of the time  was spent on group activities. Student achievement was measured, using a CLEAR-Reading Recovery data form, and results indicated that of students who had good attendance records, 50% were discontinued from the program. Although these results were below the 75% target discontinuation figure, students overall showed an average of five Text Reading Levels of improvement. Results suggest that low attendance rates posed a major problem for the program, and suggestions are given for improving attendance. (SKC)",

        "description":"Underlying virtually all of the basal reading series available in the United States today is the assumption that learning to read is a skill-by-skill and word-by-word process. This part-to-whole approach to teaching reading is based on principles of behavioral psychology and &quot;scientific management&quot; developed a half century ago and treats meaning as merely an end to be attained after words are identified and sounded out. More recent research by Frank Smith, Kenneth Goodman (l973), and others indicates reading is a process of constructing meaning rather than merely obtaining meaning. Similarly, Jean Piaget and cognitive psychologists like Lev Vygotsky have advanced the concept that children learn best when what is to be learned is functional and concrete rather than dysfunctional  and abstract, indicating that learning to read should be approached as a whole-to-part, whole language process which replaces dull and often frustrating drills with opportunities to develop an understanding of and pleasure in the written word. This approach has been adopted in New Zealand, in parts of Australia and Canada, and in a number of schools and classrooms in the United States. (Examples of each approach are presented, and three pages of references are attached.) (NH)",

The program used diagnostic testing to assess pupils' individual reading strengths and weaknesses, and provided individualized instruction to meet pupils' needs on a daily basis in a small group setting. Some program sites used computer-assisted instruction as well. Success of the program was judged by results of the &quot;Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills&quot; Reading Comprehension Subtest as pretest and posttest, and the General Inservice Evaluation Form, developed  locally. Test results showed that none of the program's objectives were met--pupils with good attendance records did not improve their reading scores, nor did the target of 80% of program personnel evaluate the program as successful. The computer users scored no better than other groups on the achievement criterion. Recommendations included rescheduling the program, giving more attention to students' individual needs, and showing greater commitment to the program on the part of teachers and administrators at participating schools.

The program featured individual and small group instruction arranged according to pupil needs. There were also pilot programs using microcomputers with fourth through eighth grade students at many of the schools. The program was evaluated through administration of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills as pretest and posttest. Test results indicated that of 3,425 students with good attendance records who were native speakers of English, average test score gain was 5.9  Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) points for the six months of instruction, which nearly met the goal of 1.0 NCE points per month of instruction. Analysis by grade revealed that the evaluation criterion was met in grades 3, 4, and 7. Average NCE gains for students using computer-assisted instruction were higher than those for the regular group at both the elementary and middle school levels. Classroom observation and teacher interviews revealed that teachers used a variety of approaches for diagnosis and instruction to build pupil self-esteem and positive attitudes toward learning, and that teachers were concerned about low parent involvement and lack of coordination between program and classroom instruction.

        "description":"Noting that accurate procedures for predicting reading ability in school settings are necessary for a variety of purposes, this paper reviews methods for predicting reading ability and presents a new, more precise model for use at the second grade level. First, the paper defines reading expectancy as an informed estimate of the level of reading achievement that can realistically be expected of an individual when the relevant facts are known. Presented next is a historical review of reading expectancy formulas from the late 1920s to the present. The review notes that many of the formulas grew more complex and began to test different aspects of reading, such as listening comprehension, while others relied on general intelligence testing to predict reading ability. After pointing  out the difficulty these models have in predicting actual achievement for individual children, the paper proposes a multiple regression model that makes use of stepwise regression analyses to test second grade native speakers of English. Correlates of reading achievement that the proposed model must account for are the topic of the next section, which discusses intelligence tests, listening comprehension tests, anxiety, attention span, self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and sex variables. Twelve tests for these variables for inclusion in a proposed reading diagnosis battery are then listed, followed by three research hypotheses and a graph of the proposed reading expectancy model. The document concludes with 67 references. (SKC)",

Construction of the instrument involved five phases: (1) finding community settings in which writing is participated in or observed by children; (2) analyzing the different functions of writing in the community; (3) creating semi-scripted writing vignettes depicting the different writing functions; (4) videotaping the vignettes; and (5) composing interview questions based on the videotapes that probe children's concepts. Sixty midwestern  public school children, from kindergarten, fourth, and sixth grades, were shown sequences of the videotape and then interviewed. Results indicated that children at all grade levels described a wide range of writing functions and placed value on writing. A detailed description of the results of the data analysis is being prepared in a separate paper. Data obtained from the study is being used to build a developmental model of children's concepts about writing functions. (ARH)",

Davies claims that the whole language program is still evolving, but is already a viable alternative to traditional approaches in intermediate grade classrooms. Davies begins by asserting that very few modifications are necessary to use the whole language approach with older students, then describes a typical day in the classroom, which includes (1) reading; (2) sharing; (3) journal writing; (4) editing; (5) written reactions to  reading; (6) logic exercises; (7) whole language content area instruction; and (8) quiet time. Davies next describes her holistic evaluation methods, which are based on observation. Davies' discussion then turns to using microcomputers in middle grade classrooms, including use of language arts software and interactive games. Finally, Davies talks about the role of the whole language teacher, interaction with administrators, the teaching philosophy, and the atmosphere in whole language classrooms.

Currently civic education is the province of social studies teachers, but English and language arts teachers could also play an important role in increasing the effectiveness of civic education. The Institute on Writing, Thinking, and Citizenship Education held at Harvard in the summer of 1987 was designed to help participants--teachers and administrators responsible for language arts/English or social studies--develop a multidiscplinary approach to civic education at all grade levels, with reading and writing skills at its core. School literature programs can  also contribute to the development of civic identity in subtle but profound ways, such as helping develop students' aesthetic and moral sensitivities, and providing them with common cultural information. This use of literature to learn history and civic pride was at one time common in schools, but today's emphasis is on offering exposure to a wide variety of fiction representing various ethnic and racial groups. Thematic units in literature for the secondary school student could focus on perceptions of the community by using fiction that calls attention to the different ways in which communities are portrayed in literature.

The second chapter presents details of the experimental design, including procedures for selecting the 560 successful teachers and their 715 students who participated in the first part of the survey. This chapter also discusses ethnography--observing response practices--in the two ninth grade writing classes that  participated in the second part of the study. The third chapter describes the response practices of the teachers, and their range and helpfulness, while the fourth chapter analyzes values about writing uncovered in the survey, the underpinnings and structuring of response. The fifth chapter provides a summary of the research, including characteristics of the successful teachers and their response practices, while the sixth chapter contemplates what can be learned from the study. The book concludes with 83 references and the following appendixes: (1) the National Writing Project surveys; (2) assignment sequences; (3) note-taking conventions and procedures for in-class data collection; (4) criteria for determining what was to be recorded on camera; (5) supplementary tables; (6) questions  for character analysis; and (7) student writing samples.

        "description":"Based on the perspective on childhood literacy which assumes that listening, speaking, reading, and writing abilities develop concurrently and interrelatedly rather than sequentially, a kindergarten literacy program was implemented in classrooms in San Antonio, Texas, to influence young childrens' writing development. Writing was linked with other activities in the childrens' lives and with other subject areas in the curriculum, and these connections included: (1) using writing for functional purposes (for example, writing to pen pals, creating shopping lists and menus); (2) linking writing with reading, which involves students reading their written work aloud; and (3) connecting writing with children's literature through various response activities (creative dramatics, artwork,  imitative writings). Connecting kindergarten writers with each other is another important factor in beginning writing development. (Student writing samples, a chart analyzing writing systems before and after creative dramatics, and an extensive list of references are appended.) (MM)",

Following an introduction that outlines the steps necessary to adapt the model to fit local needs, the first part of the document provides a timeline and guidelines for a three-year implementation period for grades K-12. The major portion advances two statements of purpose: (1) students will use listening, reading, and literature skills to understand and appreciate human experiences to share cultural commonalities and differences; and (2) students will use writing and speaking skills in a variety of modes of communication and self-expression.  Specific learning outcomes follow each goal; 17 outcomes follow the first statement, and 22 outcomes follow the second.

Twelve children, aged three, four, and five, were selected. The study involved three tasks which examined the subjects' expertise with letters, numbers, and the written form of their own names, the understandings they held relative to their own names, and with regard to two other words. Results indicated that children did not treat their own names as unique words in terms of letter order and word size. This study calls into question the view that learning the written form of one's own name is a unique case of written language learning. It would appear that when children are able to write their own  names in standard form they may also be able to exhibit very sophisticated understandings about words in our written language system.

        "description":"While there has been much debate about defining and teaching critical thinking, little discussion has occurred regarding the connection between critical thinking and creative thinking, especially in relationship to teaching speech communication. While it was once thought that creativity is something that some are born with and some are not, recent research has found that creativity can be fostered like any other thinking skill. Findings have revealed that mastering any kind of knowledge requires both creativity and critical skills, while early stages of learning require simple memorization of rules. Both the \"soft\" thinking behaviors of creative thinking (such as dreams and fantasies) and the \"hard\" behaviors of critical thinking (such as reason and reality) are needed to solve  complex problems. Thus, to encourage creative as well as critical thinking in speech classes, educators must take care to create classroom environments conducive to both kinds of thought. A nonthreatening atmosphere, emphasis on communication, and liberal doses of humor all support higher level thinking skills. A system of motivating rewards (for instance, showing how learning a skill connects with the students' lives) is also beneficial. Positive teacher attitudes, a belief that students can foster their own learning, and encouragement of classroom communication are other ways to help speech communication students develop creative and critical thinking skills.

Subjects' self-ratings were included. This comparison was operationalized through a pretest-posttest design with 12 experimental and 22 control subjects. The assessment instruments consisted of Spitzberg and Hurt's (1987) Conversational Skills Rating Scale (CSRS) and Curran's (1982) Simulated Social Interaction Test (SSIT). Two rating judges were utilized. Results, although modest, are in the expected direction. Assessment of competence with the CSRS failed to reveal any significant improvement in the experimental group relative to controls. However, the SSIT did reveal  significant improvement of the rated skills and anxiety of experimental subjects while the control group showed no significant improvement. In addition to assessing the effectiveness of the training program, this study sought to establish further validity support for the CSRS. As expected, the CSRS revealed a positive correlation to SSIT ratings. (Author)",

A total of 100 two-part questionnaires were distributed to Thai students at southwestern public universities in the United States. Forty males and 28 females, whose lengths of stay in the United States varied from 2 months to 15 years, returned usable questionnaires. Subjects were asked to indicate their degree of concern for changes in the three dimensions, as well as to rank the five types of mass media--radio, TV, film, newspapers and magazines, and videocassettes--according to their effects on Thai society. Results indicated that respondents believe U.S. mass media has affected Thailand's lifestyles most, and had lessen effects on social  problems and value conflict. Results also showed that the longer the respondents stayed in the United States, the less they perceived the impact of U.S. mass media, and that females were more concerned about the effects of mass media than males. Finally, both sexes ranked television as the most important media, but males believed that videocassettes ranked second in importance, while females ranked them as least important. Although the study should be replicated with respondents who are not liberal Bangkok residents (as most in this study were), it does suggest that U.S. mass media is having a sizeable impact on Thai society, and almost every facet of Thai society is currently integrating Western values.

        "description":"Destructive dialogue, originating from frustration and disappointment, is an intrapersonal process that always involves a person in a relationship to others and that can be defined as inner talk cast in a negative tone. It is so powerful, influential, and pervasive that it can affect all aspects of a person's life and become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The way the mind and body function can be changed by becoming aware and gaining control of the process. Control of negative inner dialogue results from using effective intervention or coping strategies, such as: awareness, labelling, shifting control of circumstances to ourselves, and positive imaging (the process of creating material pictures in the mind which can be scanned as people would scan real events in their environment).  Several other intervention strategies can be used in combination with imaging: reframing, acquiring a confidant to share ideas, providing an excuse to change, mentally shooting the source, using self-help books, learning something new, and obtaining professional help.

        "author":["Schwartzman, Roy"],
        "description":"The rhetorical functions of history depend on the domain in which history is used, with no connotations of interpretive priority attaching to the social or the academic realm. The appropriation of history in support of social causes as radically opposed as socialism and fascism fuels the temptation to subsume history under ideology, with the result that history is &quot;relativized&quot; as whatever interpretation of past events supports a particular cause. History when used as a warrant in public argument is immensely authoritative, acquiring a mythic character when divorced from factual evidence. The fact that history can by used to suit almost any purpose demonstrates how interpretive latitude allowed by uncontested terms (which are not amenable to logical dissection) can instigate  widespread adherence to the principles these terms embody. Quarrels among academic historians regarding interpretation indicate that historians themselves do not use history consensually. History in public argument is not simply true--it is truth--and as an argumentative warrant provides a point for building consensus around argumentative claims. However, rhetors who advocate a position ordained by history could escape from moral responsibility, since the argument is not theirs but that of history. It would be well to remember that the power of history is no more the property of a single cause or ideology than truth is the exclusive possession of only one person. History deserves a place in public argument, but it is not the last word. (Extensive references are attached.) (NKA)",

Subjects, 522 prospective and experienced elementary and secondary school teachers enrolled in communication classes in large eastern and western universities, completed a survey that included four student misbehavior scenarios. Respondents selected those strategies they would use to gain student compliance in the scenarios reflecting misbehavior type (active/passive) and intensity (frequent/occasional). Using pro- and antisocial Behavior Alteration Techniques (BAT)  factors as variables, four significant multivariate effects resulted. Experienced teachers reported using more pro- and antisocial strategies than did prospective teachers. Both groups relied on antisocial BATs for active misbehaviors and prosocial for passive; both groups used pro- and antisocial strategies for frequent, as opposed to occasional, misbehaviors. Antisocial BATs were used more frequently by male teachers. (Tables of data and a figure are included, and 42 references are attached.) (NKA)",

Following an introduction that pinpoints the androcentric and hegemonic nature or the concept of organizational culture, the paper challenges the empiricist methods of traditional organizational communication research and suggests the need for feminist readings that contest the authority of men as the sole authors of cultural texts. The next section of the paper discusses the implicit dualisms inherent  in the concept of culture: culture as a rational, public, and male domain is held antithetical to and privileged over nature as the emotional domain, the private sphere, and women. The major section of the paper presents a review of research studies by organizational culture scholars and proposes a feminist criticism of these studies. The following section then offers and discusses alternative research studies by Kathy Ferguson and Angela McRobbie, two feminist scholars. The paper concludes with the presentation of a preliminary agenda for reconstituting the practices and politics of organizational scholarship by developing a feminist discourse commensurate with the radical intent of the organizational culture approach.

Results indicated no significant differences between male and female managers on any component of &quot;communication control&quot;--defined here as the communicative behaviors that restrict the type, direction, frequency, and amount of participation of the other person. The same pattern (no  significant gender differences) held, regardless of whether the manager was dealing with his or her subordinate or superior. Clear status differences, on the other hand, were reported. Findings showed that managers (regardless of sex) did communicate differently with subordinates than with superiors (again, regardless of sex).

        "author":["Burtis, John O."],
        "description":"Arguing that understanding human interaction requires both a study of symbol use and a study of human action, this paper focuses on one function served by symbolization--fantasizing. Drawing upon the work of R. F. Bales, who identified the sharing of group fantasies as a useful communication function and who observed the process by which group members &quot;chain out&quot; on stories that are only indirectly related to a task at hand in order to build a sense of group unity, the paper first offers a brief description of why some fantasies chain out and others do not. It then provides clarification of and definitions for the terminology employed throughout the paper, specifically elaborating upon &quot;fantasy,&quot;&quot;richness of fantasy&quot; (the idea that some people have greater ability to fantasize  than others), and &quot;chaining out of fantasy.&quot; The paper then discusses a pilot study designed to test the &quot;richness of fantasy&quot; hypothesis. The paper concludes with a theoretical explanation for the processes of making meaning, persuasion, and problem solving--that the receiver is the source of meaning in communication and that richness of fantasy is a mediating variable in an individual's process of communication. An appendix contains the 10 richness of fantasy items used on the pilot study instrument, and four pages of references are attached. (FL)",

        "author":["Miller, Keith A."],
        "description":"Since the number of adult students engaging in higher education activities is growing rapidly and is expected to continue to climb, this paper is intended to help administrators develop a perspective from which to view adult learners on college campuses and craft programs to help faculty work more effectively with adult students. The first section of the paper discusses the ideal learning environment for adults, while the second section presents a profile of the adult student with respect to (1) social differences; (2) life experience; (3) motivations; (4) academic behaviors; (5) problems faced by returning adults; and (6) life cycles. Basic perspectives on andragogy and pedagogy are the focus of the paper's third section, which includes discussions of pedagogical and  andragogical assumptions and their implications for program design. The fourth section deals with adult development, and the fifth is concerned with research findings on how adult/pre-adult students react to lecture versus other methods of instruction, faculty attitudes, and andragogical assumptions. The sixth section contains ideas for improving the learning environment for adults, and concentrates on developing structures to aid students and faculty and helping faculty to learn and experiment. The concluding section notes that the andragogical process shifts the focus from transmitting content to the process of helping students learn. This is followed by 76 references, and an appendix containing the text of an educational orientation questionnaire for use in determining attitudes of  college faculty and administration. (SKC)",

        "author":["Hay, Ellen A."],
        "description":"Because critical thinking has become a popular topic among speech communication educators in recent years, this paper reviews the literature on teaching critical thinking skills and discusses its relevance for speech communication instruction. First, the paper briefly sketches the history of the critical thinking movement and describes the reaction of speech communication educators to the movement. Second, definitions of critical thinking are discussed, and the document notes that the definitions--logical, cognitive and communicative--differ depending on point of view. The third topic covered is how critical thinking is taught. Types of thinking skills programs are listed, including the following: (1) general thinking skills programs that can function within a communication  curriculum; (2) programs that concentrate on particular skills (such as argumentation, persuasion, debate, and logic) in particular content areas; (3) programs that teach thinking skills in isolation; and (4) programs designed specifically for speech communication classes. Teaching methods such as questioning techniques and modeling are also mentioned. The paper's fourth focus is on evaluating critical thinking. Several theoretical bases for assessment are presented, and the merits of different standardized measures are also debated. The final part of the paper concerns implications of the critical thinking movement for speech communication instruction, including the importance of cognitive and metacognitive aspects of instruction and the transfer of thinking skills to other contexts.  Thirty-one references conclude the document. (SKC)",

        "description":"Scholars have called for an integration of knowledge of the jury trial process, and in response, this paper argues that the contingency rules theory of communication can integrate and advance understanding of the trial. Four common approaches to the study of the trial are outlined briefly and criticized: the jury characteristic approach, the jury attitudes approach, the group dynamics approach, and the storytelling approach. Then, the contingency rules model is explained and examined relative to other approaches. The paper concludes that the contingency rules approach to the trial offers four advantages: (1) it integrates the findings of other approaches to the trial without losing precision; (2) it logically subsumes other approaches to the trial, offering greater explanatory  power; (3) it is more parsimonious; and (4) it is heuristic. Finally, suggestions for applying the contingency rules model to the trial process are advanced. Twenty references are appended. (Author/SKC)",

In a successful effort to enhance the system's educational objectives, Manitoba Education sustained a level of support that allowed the province's individual divisions and districts to revise their method of allocating diminished financial resources in the successful effort to enhance the system's educational objectives. In spite of shrinking resources for the province's Foundation Program and the Government Support to Education Program, a new, responsive, and expansive plan was developed and implemented. (JAM)",

        "description":"This presentation highlights and discusses the recommendations made by the National Commission on Excellence in Educational Administration in its report \"The Restructuring of a National Understanding of Requirements for Educational Leadership of the Future.\" The revamping of administrator preparation is said to be essential because current preparation is nearly irrelevant to practice and unresponsive to public demand for a more effective educational system. Three ideas in the report are cited as significant for reform of administrator education: (1) teachers are preeminent, and administrators' roles must change to grant teachers greater authority; (2) administrator preparation should be housed in professional schools rather than in colleges of arts and sciences; (3) preparation  programs should be responsive to the concerns of both the profession and the university. Courses of study should therefore be organized around problems and principles of best practice rather than around academic and research specialties of sociologists and psychologists. The preparation program should take individuals from the theoretical study of learning, teaching, organizations, and people through clinical studies to guided practice, and ultimately to independent practice. Most of the recommended adjustments have to do with building and incorporating a knowledge base of administrative practice and formalizing rigorous clinical experiences as part of administrator preparation.

Written for local school boards, professional staff who work with boards, and interested parents, the paper calls for policies that will encourage parents to assist in their children's educational development. After an introductory historical perspective on parental involvement in the American public school system, the document looks at changes in the American family and the implications these changes have for the schools. The publication discusses types, levels, steps, roles, and strategies of parent involvement to promote an understanding of the parents' link to school board leadership. Other essays discuss the differences between parental  involvement in the early grades and in middle and high grades, and the role of public schools in parent education. It is concluded that three policy goals should characterize all parent involvement regardless of the level of schooling: to promote the complete development of children, to enhance the role of the parent as the primary educator and caregiver of the child, and to help parents develop and use knowledge and skills that will enhance the educational level of families. The publication begins with a summary list of recommendations and concludes with an appended checklist for school board members to use in assessing their parent involvement policy and practice needs.

Chapter 2 outlines an eight-step process for implementing school improvement, while chapters 3 through 7 discuss each of these eight steps in detail: (1) appointing a school improvement management team or steering committee; (2) collecting baseline data; (3) raising the awareness level of faculty, students, and parents; (4) assessing the school climate;  (5) identifying improvement priorities and developing action plans; (6) organizing task forces to accomplish the tasks identified in the action plans; (7) coordinating the work of the task forces; and (8) evaluating the overall effects of the climate improvement effort. The final chapter, &quot;Why Do It?,&quot; provides anecdotal testimony as to the success of climate improvement projects in various schools. Appended are the following instruments: an instrument for rating school climate; the CFK, Ltd., School Climate Profile; two &quot;mini-audits&quot; designed to assist school officials in identifying climate improvement priorities and assessing the process and material determinants of a school; and a brainstorming and prioritizing activity instruction sheet.

Corcoran and B.L. Wilson (1986) around the role of the central office administration and the ways in which it might cooperate with schools in supporting secondary school improvement. The themes, which emerged from Corcoran and Wilson's study of 571 schools included in the Secondary School Recognition Program, are presented to reflect the writers' interpretations. Anecdotes from interviews with selected central office staff and secondary school principals are included in discussions of the themes, as well as supplemental analysis. The themes, which portrayed the dynamics of successful schools, were  derived from data on school characteristics, reports by site visitors, and reports by the schools on the factors contributing to their success. The nine themes defined and reviewed are as follows: (1) clear goals and core values; (2) leadership: (3) control and discretion; (4) solving problems and improving schools; (5) recognition and rewards for teaching; (6) high expectations and recognition of achievement; (7) student-teacher relationships; (8) school-community relations; and (9) good people and a good environment. The report offers concluding remarks with suggestions for decision-makers contemplating their district's role. Over 70 references are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"This technical manual describes the School Assessment Survey (SAS), a multidimensional questionnaire that uses teachers' perceptions to measure key organizational characteristics of a school. Developed to take advantage of recent developments in organizational theory and school effectiveness research, the SAS instrument can be used to identify areas of strength and weakness and to help decide the course of action to implement desired changes. A general overview of a perspective on schools as organizations states why that perspective is important and illustrates how it might be useful in efforts to improve educational practices. The 55 items in the SAS questionaire measure 9 distinct dimensions covering a wide range of organizational characteristics. A justification for each  dimension is offered. The history of the SAS instrument is also presented, as well as technical details regarding the measurement properties of its nine dimensions. A four-page graphic profile illustrates how the results can be presented to educators. Twenty notes and a 60-item bibliography are appended. The appendixes contain the SAS instrument and summary statistics of items in the dimensions based on data collected from a sample of 2,311 teachers in 61 schools. (MLF)",

        "description":"This paper describes the model and process developed by the Connecticut education department to assist schools in improving their effectiveness. The report offers an operational definition of the term &quot;effectiveness&quot; and summarizes the research that provides the conceptual base for the model. The characteristics selected from this summary are discussed in terms of a systems perspective that advocates the school as the unit of analysis. The systems approach argues that schools should resist focusing on only one characteristic and that meaningful change must address instruction, curriculum, organizational dynamics, and community involvement in an integrated manner. The model is built upon suggestions from a 1978 Rand document by Berman and McLaughlin that summarizes why some 293  projects receiving federal funds in 18 states varied in their degree of successful implementation. The Connecticut process maintains a voluntary, school-based approach that helps the school examine itself introspectively in relation to effectiveness characteristics so that a meaningful action plan for the principal and faculty can be developed and implemented. To trace progress, data will be gathered from approximately 25 schools at one-year intervals. The goal is to produce change in student achievement patterns by the second year of implementation. The document concludes with a discussion of future directions. A list of 53 references and a diagram of the model and process are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"In 1984, the New York State Regents issued an action plan calling for changes in curriculum, high school graduation requirements, and educational standards. Histories of school reform indicate, however, that state legislation alone cannot successfully or permanently improve educational practice. This essay therefore surveys the history of federal and state-sponsored school reform efforts in New York State in the 20th century to identify general characteristics of these varying reform movements that distinguish successful from unsuccessful attempts to change New York's schools. Included are three of the major reforms that attempted to change schools in New York State before World War II: the Hanus Report of 1911-1913, the Rural School Survey of 1922, and the Regents' Inquiry of  1937. In the postwar era, the National Defense Education Act of 1957 and Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1975 are considered, along with state-initiated efforts such as the Fleischmann Commission and the Regents' Competency Testing Program. Data are presented topically, rather than chronologically; the essay begins with a brief examination of how changing contexts have shaped major reform efforts in the state's past, and then proceeds to a discussion of how past reform efforts have been affected by the specificity of their goals, their consistency, executive leadership asserted, resources, and provisions for accountability. The evidence indicates that reforms that are clearly articulated, consistent, and within the realm of existing knowledge have a greater  likelihood of being implemented than those that pursue vague goals such as &quot;excellence&quot; and &quot;good citizenship.&quot; Forty-eight notes are appended.

        "description":"Advances in cognitive science have greatly increased our knowledge of how the human mind stores and uses information. That knowledge can be used to decompose curricular objectives so as to increase the specificity of instruction to a level of precision that should greatly enhance student writing. This article identifies some major types of cognitive structure and describes how they might be used in the process of decomposing curricular objectives. The two primary types of linguistic information are declarative (factual) and procedural. Declarative information can be subdivided into four basic types: concepts, facts, principles, and schemata. Procedural information includes process knowledge and conditional knowledge (or knowledge about when to use specific procedures). Both types  of information are commonly stored in long-term memory in cognitive structures called \"productions,\" which sometimes have associated terminology and symbols. This model for specifying the cognitive components of a given curricular objective is then applied to the objective of teaching students to read and interpret a bar graph. In laboratory tests, this process of decomposing curricular objectives has shown great promise for helping teachers to specify and plan instruction, and thereby to enhance student learning. (TE)",

        "description":"This report summarizes a two-year study of supervisory officers in Ontario. The research focused on what supervisory officers do, what skills they need, how they are prepared and selected, and how they experience the job in terms of satisfaction and effectiveness. A stratified sample of 25 boards and 4 ministry offices was selected for indepth study, with data gathered through interviews and analysis of pertinent documents. In school boards, five role types were identified: directors, business supervisory officers, central supervisory officers, area superintendents, and combined roles. In the ministry, the role types were regional office, provincial office general supervisory, and provincial office specific assignment. A matrix of action and content showed supervisory officer  tasks falling into various action groupings (such as review/evaluation, problem solving, and coordination) and content groupings (such as curriculum, personnel, and finance). In spite of contextual differences, the core actions and skills were found to be relatively constant, and systematic training for the supervisory role was found to be lacking. The study therefore concluded that major changes are needed in the preparation, experience, working conditions, and professional development of supervisory officers. In the final chapter, the researchers provide recommendations for reform, directed at governance, certification (licensing), preparation, and professional development. Proposals include the establishment of a new independent body to develop and coordinate licensing, preparation,  internship, and professional development for supervisory officers in Ontario.

        "description":"Drawing on research conclusions about the process of educational change, this report seeks to demonstrate the importance of understanding the diverse factors that inhibit or enable school improvement efforts. The report focuses on leadership and support in achieving successful change and stresses that principals are but one of several players who can create leadership for improvement. While not concerned exclusively with leadership and support, two school improvement studies are examined to illustrate how a variety of leadership configurations occur within different contexts and with varying degrees of success. Section 2 of the report summarizes the objectives of the studies--one on dissemination efforts supporting school improvement and the other on the role of teacher  incentives and rewards in implementing a technological innovation. Insights about leadership and support that came from observing change at the field sites of the two studies are discussed in section 3. Section 4 describes the report's methodology and explores the institutionalization of changes and leadership and support as they were manifested at the sites. The kinds of leadership configurations associated with the presence or absence of different types of institutionalization are detailed in section 5. The final two sections offer conclusions and recommendations for further research. The two studies generally substantiate the hypothesis that leadership and support assume varied forms and have many sources. Educational change based on the collaboration of many actors is more likely to  be successful because the opportunities created serve to maintain change after individuals move on. Numerous tables and figures comprise over one-half of the document, and include those derived from literature research and from diagrammatic analysis of the studies examined. Fourteen references are appended. (CJH)",

Principals can promote collaboration by involving faculty members in decisions related to curriculum and instruction, by coordinating teachers' schedules to allow peer observation, and by promoting norms of cooperation through their own example in  seeking teachers help with curriculum and scheduling and in observing and evaluating teachers.

The second part of the paper reviews available choices in the private sector: parochial schools (Catholic, fundamentalist, or Jewish); private, residential prep schools for the wealthy; independent schools for disadvantaged minorities; proprietary business or trade schools that promise job training and placement to disadvantaged teenagers and young adults; and home schooling.

Current school choice policies in the following states are briefly summarized: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. The evaluations of these policies conducted by Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington are then reviewed in detail. Options are then discussed for parents who are dissatisfied with the choices currently available to them in their local school district, and guidance is provided for  gathering information about a school, visiting a school, and taking various steps before making a final decision about a school. The author concludes that with the proper research, advice, and guidance, families can make good decisions about schools for their children. (TE)",

        "description":"The paper traces the establishment and outcomes of a special education program development unit as part of the West Virginia Department of Education. It is explained that the office used a process/product planning approach with information on mission, role/function, allocation of function and resources, and multiple matrix analysis planning. Based on a successful approach to general education program development, the special education program development process was guided by two underlying beliefs: learner-based decision making and research-based decision making. In order to assure a high quality research data base, a modified Delphi technique was used. A delivery system was designed which uses curriculum-based assessments to select general education and additional learning  outcomes for individualized education programs (IEPs) and which determines the least restrictive environment and graduation requirements for handicapped students. Prototypes were developed for retrieving appropriate objectives and mastery information for IEPs and for determining the most appropriate learning outcomes for students eligible for special education. Guidelines were set for reviewing and selecting special education materials. Appendixes include information on the process for interfacing existing special education objective documents with state approved learning outcomes and selecting learning outcomes for the IEP. (CL)",

The goals of this first-year evaluation were to describe the programs and services provided to special education students in AISD, compare these programs and services with those required by federal and state law and local policy, and provide decisionmakers with basic context information so that decisions about special education could be better informed. AISD was found to be meeting all legal and regulatory requirements and to be exceeding them in some service areas, specifically in providing transportation services for special education students. AISD's Special Education serves the highest  percentage of students of any of the eight largest Texas school districts and identifies larger percentages of students as learning disabled and emotionally disturbed than are identified in other urban Texas school districts (except San Antonio), in the state as a whole , and in the nation. The annual cost for a full-time equivalent special education student is $8,365, nearly three-and-one-half times the cost for a full-time regular education student, with instructional costs comprising two-thirds of the total special education costs.

A positive and effective adult confrontation process is outlined comprising ten components: (1) understand the other person's perspective; (2) know your perspective; (3) determine differences in perspectives; (4) isolate the major concern; (5) use a positive introduction; (6) get to the point quickly; (7) respect the other person; (8) control your temper; (9) encourage responses by asking questions; and (10) thank them. The use of positive confrontation when problems arise has increased educational  opportunities for the students and reduced tension between the special education teachers and the people with whom they work. Mainstream teachers are more receptive and responsive to their students and administrators are more supportive of their programs. Additionally, students learn from the teachers' example and communications with parents are more effective. Transparencies used during the presentation of this paper are included. (VW)",

Activities included assessment, inservice training, provision of materials, technical assistance, and direct support. Attitudes of parents, normal children, and school personnel toward handicapped children became more  positive as a result of project activities. The progress of the handicapped children in the total reverse mainstream classrooms generally surpassed that of similar children in partial mainstream classrooms, and was very similar to that of normal children in the mainstream classroom.

The paper provides a seven point definition of successful mainstreaming and reviews the literature on the role of special educators in such a mainstreaming program. The new role requires special educators to learn: (1) the rationale and benefits of mainstreaming; (2) methods of promoting mainstreaming; (3) curricula, rules, and social expectations in the receiving classroom; and (4) methods for preparing special education students for mainstreaming. Special educators need preparation for mainstreaming in four areas: knowledge of mainstreaming, personal support, public  relations, and functional curriculum training. Noted is a tendency of special educators to feel protective toward their students leading to a reluctance to mainstream or equitably distribute children across all potential receiving teachers. Among changes needed are the following: training and administrative support, incorporation of special and regular education into an integrated total educational system, and recognition of mainstreaming as an ongoing process in the education of handicapped children.

Large group, small group, and a minimal amount of one-to-one instruction is used as is increased structure within the curriculum. The rationale for emphasizing group rather than the traditional individual curriculum in a combined comprehensive delivery system is discussed. Guidelines for developing effective groups include assessing all children, establishing individualized education programs for handicapped students, developing a core curriculum, planning  integrated groups, and structuring one-to-one sessions. Preliminary evaluation results indicated handicapped children participated significantly in mainstream activities while achieving at the same or better levels than they did in earlier self-contained classes.

        "description":"The paper is a product of the 3-year project, \"Functional Mainstreaming for Success,\" designed to develop a model for instructional mainstreaming of handicapped children (3-6 years old) in community settings. The paper reviews research on parent involvement in their children's mainstreaming along with variables that may promote or discourage parent involvement. The literature review is organized into sections on: definition of mainstreaming; characteristics of the research (such as dependent measures, age of the child); preparation of parents for mainstreaming--parent concerns (e.g. inadequate knowledge about mainstreaming, quality of education, support services, social isolation, grading, and inappropriate models and safety issues). The section on methods for addressing parent  concerns considers mode of communication, timing of information about mainstreaming, content, and delineating parent responsibilities in mainstreaming. Models of parent involvement and the importance of continued parent involvement are briefly considered. Three recommended components for a model of parent involvement include: (1) a method of assessing parent interests and needs prior to mainstreaming so that specific concerns can be addressed; (2) a variety of options for parent involvement with specific activities listed for teachers to use as a guide for sharing with parents; and (3) an active teacher training program to acquaint teachers with the model for parent involvement.

The literature review examines activities and methods to prepare nonhandicapped children for the mainstreaming of handicapped children. After providing a seven-point definition of mainstreaming, the paper reviews the literature on general awareness and skill building. General awareness activities are intended to provide information about children with handicaps and to model appropriate attitudes and behaviors toward persons with handicaps. The skill training activities are designed to teach and reinforce skills which will allow children to interact appropriately with  handicapped persons. Areas discussed include puppetry, simulation activities, working with aids and appliances, inviting guest speakers to class, class discussion, use of children's books and films, videotapes and other media presentations, and participation in role play and problem solving activities. The paper concludes that while there is a general consensus regarding the efficacy of such activities, there is a paucity of data which empirically demonstrate their effectiveness. (DB)",

The study also sought to expand the Vermont design to include a broader range of factors relating employment status and school preparation. Factors in both studies related to employment status were school location, gender, manner of exit, and work experience in high school, with no relationship between employment and vocational experience. In both states, jobs tended to be located through a self/family/friends network rather than through employment-related service agencies. In the expanded study involving Delaware students only, results  showed that the special education/vocational programs were producing employable students, with 67% employed full- or part-time (compared to 80% employment for all youths). The learning-disabled were more likely to be employed than individuals with other handicapping conditions. Program placement (e.g., resource room, self-contained, special school), intensity of special education services, and vocational training were not related to employment status. Factors showing the strongest relationship to holding a job were transportation availability, method of exit from school, and race. (JDD)",

The Teacher Effectiveness Expert System portion uses teacher data concerning attitudes, goals, and background to identify teaching problems with direct instruction, questioning skills, or academic learning time. Finally, the teacher works with the Training Experience Selecting Expert System which uses some 200 options to produce an individualized set of recommended training experiences based on the data entered earlier as well as on responses to additional questions eliciting information on student age, teaching area,  availability of teachers' aides, and other factors. An evaluation of the system conducted with 18 teachers suggested that it improved attitudes toward mainstreaming and increased concerns about impact upon students, collaboration with other professionals and widening the benefits of mainstreaming. A study comparing the system's training recommendations with those made by expert trainers found the SNAP system comparable. Fourteen appendixes comprising 90 percent of the document provide technical background on the system, samples of questionnaires and forms, discussions about the design and use of expert systems, and a 50-page bibliographic chart analyzing research on effective instruction.

The curriculum based assessment and instructional recommendations reflect the position that normal developmental sequences do not solely constitute appropriate guidelines for testing and teaching severely handicapped individuals since tasks must address skills suited to the subject's chronological age. Evaluation involved both formal test results (Uniform Performance Assessment System and Autism Screening Instrument for Educational Planning) and informal test results (task analytic assessment, teacher-made attending skills test, teacher-made phonetic speech skills test, teacher-made receptive  language skills test, teacher-made imitation skills test, observational pedestrian skill assessment, and checklist for assessment of recreational skills). Educational recommendations focused on structuring the learning environment to simulate the daily routine of naturally occurring events and to stress the skills of increased engagement in a task and development of a communication system. Figures and tables give such information as: a sample task analysis, a sample of a schedule of functional skills occurring at natural times during the school day, and sample plans for teaching communication skills, self-help skills, and leisure skills.

Subjects were 61 Hispanic LEP students (grades 2-5) enrolled in MR classes during 1982-83. Data collected from student folders indicated that mean age at time of referral was 7 years 4 months, and that general lack of academic progress was the most commonly cited reason. More than 75 percent of students' families used Spanish as the primary home language. Teachers generally rated LEP MR students as having very low language proficiency in English. Information about the language used in  administering standardized tests was typically not recorded. Available data suggested that the subjects were, in fact, mentally retarded, and that classification was assigned when low scores across measures left little doubt. Thus, districts seemed to identify the more severely retarded students, while mildly retarded LEP students may not be adequately served. While safeguarding schools against litigation, this practice may deprive handicapped students of needed specialized services. Based on these and other findings, recommendations for policy, practice, and research are offered. (JW)",

Subjects received one of four treatments for 4 days: repeated writing with structural cues, repeated revision with structural cues, writing on a new topic with structural cues, and writing on a new topic with mechanics cues. Final compositions produced on day 5 were analyzed for fluency, writing mechanics, and paragraph structure. Analysis of variance for fluency factors revealed that all groups showed significant improvement from pretest to posttest on the production factor; analysis for mechanics and structure factors indicated that students receiving instruction in writing mechanics made  significantly more progress than students receiving instruction in paragraph structure. Non-parametric tests on structural variables showed significant changes for use of clincher sentences for students receiving both mechanics and structural instruction. No significant differences existed among the four groups at posttest for use of topic or clincher sentences at posttest. Results suggested that highly structured daily writing sessions can be effective in improving writing fluency, mechanics, and structure. Instruction in writing mechanics, appeared to have a more pervasive effect on writing skills than instruction in paragraph structure.

Lexical errors made in examinations were collected and coded by type, and the usefulness of the \"Longman Active Study Dictionary\", designed for ESL learners, in helping to correct the errors was analyzed. The results suggest systematic differences in error types made by students of different language backgrounds. It is proposed that (1) analysis of errors made by language learners can be useful to dictionary writers in increasing the materials' effectiveness and (2) a particular dictionary can vary in effectiveness among different target language groups.

The report presents results from each of these groups separately and summarizes the findings. A major finding was that all respondents identified English language training as the most important refugee resettlement need. Additional findings were that: (1) most young adult refugees attended school during their first 6 months of  resettlement, and after 18 months, more than a third were in school; (2) English and understanding rules and regulations are the two main difficulties of new arrivals, both in school and on the job; and (3) recommendations for additional offerings in the refugee processing centers included more English instruction, cultural orientation, and vocational training, specifically focusing on career planning, the U.S. school system, U.S. laws and legal system, social behavior, and the reality of living in the United States.

This approach uses different teaching methods and strategies. After an introductory section on second language learning and literacy in young children, the guide describes whole language methods for classroom use. The methods are presented in two groups: those that promote second language reading, and those promoting second language writing. Techniques presented include the language experience approach, shared reading with big books (i.e., books written specifically  for children in enlarged print), sustained silent reading, dictated stories, creative writing, story completion, and dialogue journals. Specific classroom procedures and some charts are included. (MSE)",

        "description":"Two experiments examined the process of acquisition of sentence structure in the passive voice among young children. The subjects were several hundred monolingual French-speaking children aged 4-11 in schools in Liege, Belgium. The two experiments used different subject groups. In the first experiment, the children were required to interpret sentences of varying types (plausible and plausibly reversible, implausible but plausibly reversible, and plausible but not plausibly reversible active and passive sentences) presented in either a realistic or a fictitious instructional context. Results showed complex patterns of responses illustrating the influences of semantic and syntactic factors in sentence comprehension, and their evolution over time. In the second experiment, the  subjects interpreted syntactically regular and anomalous passive sentences according to semantic type. Results suggest that when the formal syntactic marks of passivity play a major role in sentence interpretation, the influence of the agentive preposition is more important than that of the auxiliary and/or past participle. A view of the development of passive sentence comprehension that sees it as an evolutionary product of a flexible set of interpretive strategies relating semantic and syntactic factors is proposed.

Data sources included: student records for the State Work Study, College Work Study, and nonworking financial aid recipients; and surveys of campus administrators and students. It was found that work had no impact on the academic performance and very little impact on the academic progress of full-time undergraduates. Neither the number of hours worked nor the rate of pay had a strong impact on a student's grade point average (GPA), number of credit hours attempted, or the ratio of credits earned to credits attempted. For persistence, the working student, on average,  was estimated to take slightly longer to complete college than the nonworker. Additional findings include: the best college GPA prediction was high school GPA; older students performed better academically than the younger students; and State Work Study students generally had higher GPAs than College Work Study students or nonworkers.

Students were surveyed to determine goal commitment and institutional commitment, and background variables (including parents' educational levels, student's high school rank and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, intended major, and gender) were controlled. It was concluded that college involvement can be predicted from levels of initial goal and institutional commitment. Specifically: (1) what students bring with them to  college predisposes them to get involved, as background factors themselves account for 3% to 18% of the variation; (2) initial goal commitment is a significant predictor of most of the measures of students' academic and social involvement; and (3) initial institutional commitment was not associated with any of the measures of academic or social involvement after background variables were controlled.

        "description":"According to the 22nd annual survey of entering freshmen in the United States, freshman interest in teaching careers has increased by more than two-thirds since 1982. However, this level of interest still falls short of the projected demand. The 1987 data also suggest potential problems with future supplies of certain technology and health care professionals. Interest in nursing among freshman women has fallen by more than half in 4 years, to 4%. Engineering and technology continue to show sharp declines among both sexes, although interest is higher now among women than 10 years ago. Freshman interest in engineering has fallen by more than a fourth since 1982, and in computing by more than two-thirds in the same period. Among freshman women, the career preference for medicine  almost equals the interest in nursing. Business continues to be the most preferred career among freshmen, and being financially well off is one of the top personal life goals. Among political preferences, &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; is still the largest category among freshmen, although they strongly endorse a number of traditionally liberal issues. The 1987 data also suggest that freshman participation in government aid programs may have stabilized after six years of steady decline. An American Council on Education press release on this report is attached. (KM)",

The research productivity of 63 full-time faculty members in the college of education at a public university were assessed, with productivity defined in terms of the number of papers presented at professional meetings, number of articles published in refereed journals, number of proposals submitted to external funding agencies, number of proposals funded, and total dollar value of grants and contracts awarded. Data were derived from university records for the 1986 fiscal year. Contract status and gender differences in research productivity measures were found to be not significantly different, and no  interaction effects were observed. It is noted that gender differences were absent in spite of rank, salary, and experience differences, all in favor of the males. It is also noted that these results show non-tenure-track faculty to be performing much like their tenured and tenure-track colleagues. Three tables present the results of the statistical analysis.

In addition to testimony from college representatives, an introductory statement of Senator Jim Sasser indicates that the FY 1988 budget calls for spending cuts of $5.9 billion in education programs, representing a decrease of nearly 30% from the 1988 current services level. The Administration proposes to cut $1.2 billion in funding for the Pell Grant Program, another $1.5 billion from other student financial assistance, and $1.3 billion in budget authority savings from the Guaranteed Student  Loan Program. The President's budget would eliminate federal funding for the Vocational Education program, representing savings of nearly $900 million. The President's budget would also abolish the Supplemental Grants, College Work-Study, State Student Incentive Grants, and some smaller graduate fellowship programs. Information on student aid during FY 1981-1987 is also provided in a fact sheet prepared by American Council on Education vice-president Charles B. Saunders. (SW)",

Paradigm cases of five senior and five sophomore baccalaureate students were transcribed and analyzed for common meanings and themes. The paradigms concern touching patients, giving shots/creating pain, caring for and being intimate with young patients, and relating to patients as friends. Heideggerian hermeneutics was used to analyze the paradigm cases, treating the text as analog. To provide for bias control, the paradigm cases were analyzed by a research team with multiple stages of interpretation. The objective was not to reveal private subjective meanings or to make generalizations, but to discover commonalities in the actual meanings and practices of student nurses. Clinical  learning experiences were found to be socializing experiences, helping student to understand the lived experiences of patients and nurses within the context of the nursing culture. The findings can help nurse educators restructure clinical learning experiences for students to enhance their learning in the context of patient care experiences. (SW)",

For the first time in 15 years, the total number of first-professional degrees decreased.

The colleges were asked to provide information about sources and uses of funds and the number of faculty, staff and students in FY 1985-86. Results included the following: (1) Kentucky's investment produced an expenditure impact of 2.4 times the initial investment; and (2) direct instate expenditures by institutions, students, and visitors due to the presence of public higher education in Kentucky created approximately 61,800 new jobs in the state.

Respondents were persons designated by the CEOs as having responsibility for the evaluation of institutional effectiveness. A total of 167 institutions participated, for a response rate of 54%. This paper compares responses by: (1) the type of institutions (highest degree offered, governance, and size); (2) the function of the office responsible for evaluation; and (3) the existence of institutional research offices. Few  differences were found across types of institutions. However, the overall results point out specific areas where the majority of institutions are not currently engaged in ongoing, institutional assessment. An important finding of the survey is that the majority of institutions have not approached student outcomes assessment as an ongoing activity with an institution-wide perspective.

Specifically, the study examined two measures of central tendency, the median and the mean, to determine which method best addressed the question of competence versus incompetence, rather than the teaching style used. The data utilized were the student evaluations of instruction for the 1986-87 year at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. The evaluation data for each class were merged with the personnel system to capture faculty demographics. A total of 210 faculty were included. The results indicated that the median better addresses the  questions of competence than does the mean, given the limitations of ordinal data combined with the highly negatively skewed distribution. Those faculty rated between 3.5 and 4.0 on a five-point scale often are subject to unwarranted scrutiny by personnel committees concerning their competence. If the median were used, those questions would not occur. Recommendations are made regarding (1) feedback procedures by department chairs and deans; (2) peer review systems; (3) collection of data on valued teaching activities; and (4) personnel procedures that weight teaching, research, and service.

The matrix distinguishes the types of social impacts of computing at three levels--the individual,  organizational, and extra-organizational. The other axis of the matrix categorizes computing activities, tools and procedures into six groups: career/personal, databases, data/file maintenance, networking/electronic mail, security and control, and word processing/graphics. The result is a matrix of changes in behavior; each cell in this matrix is discussed. In addition, implications and suggestions for planning and management are discussed. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"The National Teachers Examination (NTE) core battery tests are designed to be an objective measure of academic achievement for students entering teacher education programs (Parts I and II) and for seniors completing such programs (Part III). Passing these tests at specified levels is a requirement in North Carolina. While the cut-off scores for Parts I and II are relatively low, the cut-off score for Part III, the test of professional knowledge, is substantially higher. To address this problem, a department of education and the institutional research office of North Carolina Central University developed a procedure for identifying students who would pass Parts I and II but would be in danger of falling below the cut-off level on Part III. The purpose was to provide counseling and  other assistance for those students as they prepare to take Part III of the test. By examining students' test scores and grades on the four required education methods courses, a data set of 64 students was identified, and multiple regression analyses were computed to determine the best combination of variables to predict Core Battery III (Part III) scores. The formula was then applied to other education students, and an extremely high correlation was found between the actual and the predicted Core Battery III scores. The meaning of the results and the potential use of the formula in aiding students is discussed. (KM)",

Of concern was whether students carefully and thoughtfully read the questionnaire items, and whether there was any evidence of spiteful or gratuitous responses. A total of 101 students rated six lecturers from the education, history, and geography departments. Results provide some evidence that students give honest and thoughtful feedback on teaching and course content. It seemed possible that students feared being equally honest about their lecturers.

An approach is suggested for college teachers to help them better motivate and evaluate students who participate in classroom discussion. Reliable, accurate, and meaningful assessment of students' participation in classroom discussion can be achieved if an instructor bases the assessment on criteria that are known to all students, are reinforced, and are operationally defined. The approach described involves the use of behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) to assess student performance. A series of statements are used to form a scale to assess classroom performance. Students are involved in the development of the appraisal instrument. Student views concerning adequate classroom performance yield anchors or  statements that have similar meanings for students and the instructor. This approach provides clear performance expectations for the student. The domain of performance is explained as well as the indication of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. Steps in the development of BARS are outlined. (SW)",

Using a new form of address and a flat routing mechanism called Cartesian routing, this algorithm is designed to solve three problems: (1) overhead that increases with size and thus limits expansion; (2) an inability to allow mobile hosts free movement throughout the internetwork; and (3) routing and packet processing requiring large tables or substantial computation per packet. It also retains two desirable attributes of current algorithms: robustness in the presence of link and router failures, and the use of short  paths. This report discusses (1) routing and addressing problems in large metropolitan scale internetworks; (2) Cartesian routing; (3) heuristic modifications; (4) congestion control; (5) applying Cartesian routing to a metropolitan region; (6) host mobility; and (7) simulating Cartesian routing.

The impact of a conference sponsored by the National Science Foundation and Human Resources Research Organization in 1980 on the evolution of computer literacy both as a concept and as a curriculum is then discussed. It is noted that this was the beginning of the debate over whether or not computer literacy should include programming. The different approach taken by the \"new\" computer literacy in the early 1980s is also briefly discussed, and five predictions for the future based on a consensus of computer literacy \"thinkers\" are presented: (1) software  development will improve and increase; (2) textbook publishers will continue to control computer literacy curriculum; (3) teachers and administrators will continue to need more and better training; (4) the use of technology will alter the organization of schools; and (5) computer hardware will continue to drop in price and improve in performance.

Designed for use by top public school administrators and consultants, the purpose of the EIC was to help them save time and do a more effective job by expanding their knowledge about educational problems or issues they were facing on the job. It is noted that, in the period covered by this report (July 1986 through June 1987), the EIC responded to 1,172 requests from 411 individuals and--because requesters shared the information--reached more than 25,400 others. This report provides analyses of data on the groups served by the EIC during its final year, how the information provided was utilized, client evaluations of the  research packets provided by the EIC, the value of the information to clients, staffing and service from 1983 through 1987, types of research packets and other information services provided, the sources and types of information included in research packets, average packet preparation time in minutes, and research packet preparation time by activity. In conclusion it is noted that, during the 15 years it was in operation, the EIC responded to 9,347 requests for information needed by administrators and consultants to handle their professional assignments and solve on-the-job problems more effectively, and that client reaction to EIC services was consistently extremely positive. The EIC was discontinued when the Georgia Department of Education was reorganized in May 1987. Nine tables display  the data discussed in the report. (RP)",

        "description":"This volume marks the completion of Phase II of the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) project of inquiry into the issues inherent in the introduction of new information technologies in education. It summarizes the issues discussed and the recommendations made by four working groups at an international conference, each of which focused on the effects of new information technologies on instruction in one of the four basic skills, i.e., reading, writing, science, and mathematics. Members of these groups included representatives of Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States as well as various western European nations. Noting the increased pressure on governments to provide better basic skills education, it is suggested that two emerging forces can help to  provide a sound basis for the introduction of new technologies into education--inexpensive information processing power, especially computers; and the growing field of cognitive science that can rigorously study, understand, and improve the educational process. Each of the four basic skills is examined in the context of: (1) current instruction; (2) existing information technologies; (3) promising areas of research and prototype development; and (4) the implications of the new technologies. It is recommended that OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) member nations encourage course demonstration and development; reexamine the basic skills curriculum in light of changes brought about by new information technologies; cooperate with other countries to develop software  that is both effective and affordable; and encourage research in the cognitive and instructional sciences. The text is supplemented with various figures, a bibliography is provided at the end of each of the four major sections, and a glossary is included. (EW)",

A brief discussion of why computers should be used in the classroom introduces five chapters which provide overviews of the following topics: (1) the use of computers in teaching and learning (areas of computer use and using the computer as a teaching/learning tool); (2) types of software available for schools (computer-assisted instruction software, applications software, and databases); (3) integrating computers into the classroom; (4) developing a plan for using computers in the classroom (setting up a classroom computer center and working  with only one computer in the classroom); and (5) evaluating educational software (general questions, questions about instructional design, and questions about physical characteristics of the program). A concluding statement argues that the key to continued growth and expansion in the educational computing field lies with classroom teachers and urges them to take an interest in computers and begin to use this important new tool in their classrooms.

        "description":"This report describes a microcomputer system which collects data from students in classrooms on a daily basis and is then used to evaluate concept achievement and attitude changes through a time series analysis. Two pilot studies in two junior high schools in Ohio are detailed, where eighth grade students' progress in an earth science study unit on the Great Lakes was monitored using the study management program. Data from the first study were incomplete but did permit some modification of the program before it was tried again. Data for the second study show a baseline pattern of decreasing performance which has been found in other studies using this data collection system. It appears that students begin to resent having to respond to questions on information that they have not  been taught; they tire of trying to answer the questions correctly; and their performance falls. However, in the &quot;intervention&quot; phase of data collection, when the unit is being used, the positive influence of the unit on the students' knowledge is indicated by a rising curve. It also appears that student performance remains high following the end of the unit. The text is supplemented with three figures and an eight-item bibliography is provided. (EW)",

The emphasis of the simulation is on the acquisition and application of concepts and comprehension of the structuring of output through the execution of the program's statements, not on learning the technical and syntactic aspects of a large computer language. A study was conducted with fourth and sixth grade students to determine whether this type of simulation could be used to teach basic programming concepts to the non-programmers population. All students were found to be able to program the Transparent Computer and run their own programs within a short  period of time, whether or not their pretests had shown any previous programming experience. The study results suggest that the Transparent Computer is the kind of concrete model whose transparency, interactivity, concreteness, and simplicity provide an efficient method for teaching basic programming.

        "description":"The difficulties that younger students experience in understanding concepts related to the use of variables in computer programming are examined through descriptions of two studies: (1) detailed case studies of six highly intelligent children--three fourth graders and three sixth graders--who learned to program in BASIC during 60 hours of instruction under the careful observation of research staff; and (2) a study in a regular classroom environment with 73 children in the fourth and sixth grades who had 12 two-hour hands-on lessons in programming. The programming textbook used in both studies taught the use of variables in the second half of the course, thus permitting comparison of the acquisition of programming concepts related to variables and the acquisition of concepts that  do not involve variables. The results of the first study indicated that the fourth graders, in contrast to the sixth graders, were unable to learn the concepts associated with variables, even though they had understood the concepts without variables. The results of the second study indicated that the inability to understand concepts associated with variables was related more to the level of academic achievement than to grade level. It is suggested that four factors may explain the difficulties younger students experience in learning to use variables: (1) the level of abstraction in using variables; (2) the dynamic nature of the values of variables; (3) the degree of complexity in using variables; and (4) the level of reasoning required. Measures that may help to overcome the influence of  these factors are suggested, and a 25-item bibliography is provided. (EW)",

Fourteen suggestions for future computer applications in this field are then presented as a way to stimulate creative thinking by the school psychologist who is a also a computer enthusiast. The report concludes with brief discussions of issues in the areas of professional status, ethics, research, and theory, as they relate to current and future computer use by school psychologists.

The article describes the development of the audiocassette materials, which were designed for use as an alternative to group tours of the libraries, and an evaluation of the materials after one semester of use. These self-guided, half-hour tours are designed to help patrons develop an increased appreciation for the variety of resources and services available at the libraries and feel more comfortable about asking  for assistance. The main library tour script provides information on the library's organizational structure and services, the information desk, reference library, documents library, online catalog terminals, serial record, circulation office, circulation desk, stacks east/deck directory, stacks west, first floor foyer, interlibrary loan office, newspaper library, and university archives. The undergraduate library script includes information on the library's media center, periodicals desk, reference collection, college and career center, reference desk, card catalog, online catalog, browsing area, self-management lab, circulation desk, question board, reserve desk, book collection, and compact shelving area. A listing of tour stops, self-guided library tour objectives, maps of tour stops  for both libraries, and a daily report form are also included. (KM)",

        "description":"The main purposes of this study were to ascertain something of the quality of in-house use of materials in a science library, and to test the use of interviews as a method of measuring such use. Brief interviews were held with 414 users of the University of Illinois Veterinary Medicine Library (VML) between March 2 and May 13, 1987, to obtain information on the purpose of their visit and their use of library materials (other than reserve books) while in the VML. A count was also kept of the number of persons in the library and of the books and journals left on the tables. Of the four hypotheses tested, support was found for only one: that the number of items used in the library are at least twice as high when reported by the interviewees as when measured by table counts. It is  suggested that future research might start with the hypothesis that people who use materials in a science library are doing so for substantive research and that typically they find what they seek. It is concluded that interviews are to be preferred to both table counts and self-administered questionnaires for collecting data. The report is supplemented with three tables and 18 footnotes/references, and a copy of the interview questions and the one-way frequency distribution of responses is appended. (CGD)",

(This law was enacted as a result of concerns that the government must improve its collection, use, and dissemination of information.) Data for this study, which was conducted in 1987, was collected through: (1) interviews with and information obtained from the Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration; (2) interviews with information resources management officials at the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Labor, and Health and Human Services; and (3) a review of literature related to either information resources management or the  Paperwork Reduction Act. The following Information resources management problems that continue to exist in government agencies were identified: (1) inadequate planning processes; (2) lost potential savings due to improper management of information resources; (3) overlapping systems containing duplicate information within agencies; and (4) lack of focus on the broader objectives of the act. It was also found that none of the agencies studied had established criteria for determining achievement of the act's objectives. (CGD)",

The resulting approach--performance measures based on user studies--is then discussed in terms of data collection, possible benefits, and limitations. It is concluded that: (1) valid procedures, i.e., measures that actually measure what they purport to measure, must be utilized by libraries to adequately evaluate their services; (2) libraries should be most concerned with measuring their ultimate product,  performance or effectiveness, based on user data such as satisfaction; (3) a real need exists for libraries to be accountable for the effectiveness of their services; and (4) user-oriented performance measures provide a valid evaluation technique.

Usable responses were returned by 19.4% of the secretaries and 18% of the supervisors. Study findings included the following: (1) 46.4% of the respondents felt that secretarial positions would change significantly over the next 10 years due to technology; (2) over 60% of the respondents indicated that  more responsibilities and subjects would be &quot;very important&quot; for secretaries in 1997 than in 1987; (3) over 50% of the respondents felt that handling telephone duties, typing with accuracy, meeting the public, organizing and using a file system, organizing and prioritizing work and handling mail tasks were &quot;very important&quot; responsibilities for secretaries in 1987; (4) over 50% of the respondents felt that using voice mail, using a micrographics filing system, using electronic calendaring and mail were &quot;not applicable&quot; job responsibilities for 1987; and (5) only one subject (medical secretarial procedures) and one responsibility (taking and transcribing shorthand) were expected to be &quot;not applicable&quot; job responsibilities for secretaries in 1997.

Study findings, based on a 80% response rate, included the following: (1) women administrators functioned at every level except chancellor, with 50%  serving as directors; (2) the majority of the 49 Texas community colleges employed--on the average--between one to five women administrators; (3) 53.8% of the respondents held a master's degree as their highest degree; (4) 53.4% of the respondents were the &quot;founding&quot; administrators for at least one of the positions they had held; (5) 47% were clustered in the student services track, 18.1% were in academic affairs positions, and 17.5% were in administration; (6) only 16 of the 212 respondents had worked in more than one Texas community college; (7) 57% indicated that they had a mentor in their career in higher education administration; and (8) personal contacts were the best source of information about new positions.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether there were significant differences in the characteristics of students who followed the \"cooling out\" process and those who did not. The \"cooling out\" process was defined as a set of counseling strategies designed to assist students with unrealistic aspirations in selecting alternative career goals which would be more in line with their abilities. For this study, \"cooling out\" encompassed pre-entrance placement testing and/or advising, mandatory or voluntary placement into one or more remedial courses, placement on academic warning and/or probation, and complete withdrawal from the institution or changing initial major to an alternative program which is perceived as being less rigorous and/or associated with less status. The study sample  was drawn from one urban and one rural community college in Florida. From master lists of students whose last term of enrollment was fall 1984, 100 dropouts and 100 college graduates were selected. Data from academic transcripts were supplemented by additional information obtained from telephone interviews. Study findings included the following: (1) there was a statistically significant relationship between students' graduation status and the \"cooling out\" process; (2) the \"cooling out\" process appeared to be linked to dropping out regardless of race, gender, or father's occupation; (3) the relationship between race and the \"cooling out\" process was statistically significant; and (4) gender and father's occupations were not statistically related to the \"cooling out\" process.

The purposes of the study were to: (1) define the minimum levels of competence required of a student wishing to do college-level work for degree credit; (2) develop methods and criteria for assessing how much students are learning in remedial programs and how successful they are in degree credit work after remediation is complete; and (3) propose procedures by which even more of the remedial work done in the Virginia system of higher education can be undertaken by the community colleges. The study report is divided into sections addressing these three purposes. Section 1 considers minimum competency levels in terms  of mandatory student assessment; establishes minimum levels of competence in writing, reading, mathematics; and discusses levels of instruction, options for assessment procedures, enrollment in remedial and other courses, enrollment limits, and class size. Section 2 offers recommendations for assessing the effectiveness of remediation in terms of student learning and student success in degree-credit work. Section 3 proposes procedures whereby the community college system can take on more of the remedial work provided in Virginia higher education. (EJV)",

        "description":"In fiscal year 1984, the Illinois Community College Board initiated a statewide program review and evaluation process, through which each of the Illinois public community colleges has implemented a review process to evaluate both instructional programs and student/academic support services. Each college designed a program review process to serve its own needs. Eight colleges have established &quot;a screening model,&quot; which begins with an annual screening of statistical data available on all instructional programs. Based on these data, individual programs are selected for either a more focused review of a particular problem or a comprehensive review. A &quot;proportional model&quot; is used by 33 colleges. This model involves the pre-selection of approximately 20% of the college's programs for  comprehensive review each year. The individual units selected for evaluation conduct a detailed self-study, which is then reviewed and verified by a college-wide committee or an external review team. Four colleges have established a &quot;divisional model,&quot; a process which is similar to the proportional model in that the process begins with a self-study and culminates in college-level action; but rather than pre-selecting 20% of the programs for review, the college selects a particular organizational division for review each year. Thus, the number of programs reviewed may differ substantially from year to year. A &quot;combination model,&quot; which integrates aspects of the &quot;screening&quot; and &quot;proportional&quot; models, is used by five colleges. During fiscal year 1987, 1,556 instructional programs and 127  student and academic support services programs were reviewed. As a result, 39 programs (3%) are being withdrawn or phased out, and 101 (6%) have been rescheduled for further review. (EJV)",

Data for this study were obtained through observations of 11 recruited children and their classmates during a 4-year period. These observations were supplemented by informal conversations, interviews, and school documents and files. It was found that although the school was perceived by the community as excellent, and had many fine qualities, the recruited children were adversely affected by other qualities. The school's pedagogy gave little attention to social outcomes such as cross-cultural and interracial understanding; the assimilationist ideology of the school excluded pluralistic curricula;  and the \"color-blind\" universalism accepted in the school obscured the need for \"affirmative\" treatment of some children. It is concluded that the optimum programs for desegregated early childhood education are traditional, developmentally oriented ones in which: (1) schooling is an extension of the family; (2) a flexible pedagogy allows for recognition of children's previous and concurrent socialization; and (3) the needs of the children are considered more important than the demands of an explicit curriculum.

Because many Canadian parents do not have extended families to turn to, they are increasingly paying for child care. More than half prefer a form of care other than the one they use. Canadian policy and programs should support parents who care for their children at home as well as parents who use out-of-home care. A wide range of options are needed, including in-home care, nonprofit center care, workplace care, for-profit center care, and community cooperative care. To provide access to programs and services evenly across the nation, the federal government should establish a special, time-limited grant for a variety of nonprofit child care  demonstration projects throughout Canada. In addition, family-responsive working arrangements should be encouraged, as should family-focused employee assistance programs. Special attention must be given to ways of improving and strengthening the viability of in-home child care, and to the provision of a range of support services. Assessments of the costs of such a program of services should take into account benefits the system provides to families and society. (RH)",

Pessimistic, dystopian scenarios, in contrast, point out that microelectronic technologies have been introduced as a way to greater efficiency in industrial production. Historical antecedents suggest that microelectronic innovation is not the precursor of a radically new form of social organization, but, rather, is the logical extension of the historical trend to rationalize production processes and to counter the declining rate of profit by substituting equipment and machinery for labor and  wages. Whereas computopian and dystopian views recognize the capacity of the new technologies to increase differentiation, it is evident that increased social differentiation has increased social disintegration. At a time of crisis in the welfare state, governments now hope, unrealistically, to find within a compassionate community the resources needed to compensate for the loss of institutional supports and services. As the price of estrangement in society becomes increasingly apparent, public policy must be focused on the reintegration of society. In that effort, technological innovation has an as yet unrealized role to play. (RH)",

Quebec's 1984 working paper on family policy, &quot;For Quebec Families,&quot; is illustrative of one government's rediscovery of family by means of the appropriation of the idea of family as a principle of integration within the context of characteristically atomistic and fragmented industrial states. However, it is by no means clear that one can any longer reasonably speak of the family and its potentials, capacities, and strengths. Current family realities force one to speak of diverse types of family and of the complexly interwoven dimensions of family living. If researchers are to make a place for families in  the future, they will devote themselves to a fundamental, and likely critical, assessment of patterns of economic development, income distribution, work, employment, and education. Reappraisal of Quebec's working paper on family policy suggests that it provides a family perspective on a wide range of public policies, identifying the interdependence among families within their neighborhoods and communities as crucial to the creation of a central place for families in the future of Quebec society.

        "description":"In his article &quot;The 'Effects' of Infant Day Care Reconsidered,&quot; Jay Belsky (see PS 017 108) concludes that maternal employment puts infants at risk for developing emotional insecurity and social maladjustment. After a review of Belsky's and other research, a different conclusion is offered in this paper. It is agreed that infants whose mothers work full-time during their first year are more likely than infants of mothers who work part-time or not at all to be classified as insecurely attached when such infants are observed with their mothers in Ainsworth's Strange Situation procedure. But the difference is not large, and it does not necessarily reflect emotional maladjustment. There is no clear evidence in the literature that day care places infants at risk. Belsky suggests that  observed day care effects may be affected by day care quality; children's age, sex, and temperament; hours of separation from mother; overstimulation by mother; and congruence between mother's attitude and work status. There is no convincing evidence that these factors are involved. The mother's attitude toward the infant, her emotional accessibility and behavioral sensitivity, and her desire for independence (her own and the infant's) may be more important factors. Research is needed to assess and investigate such mediating factors. (PCB)",

        "description":"A 30-year longitudinal study was undertaken in order to document the course, and determine the outcome, of all pregnancies in a community of Asian Americans on Kauai, the western most of the Hawaiian Islands and equidistant from the continental United States and Japan. The project's goal was to document both the good and poor outcomes of the children's development by focusing on the children's vulnerability--susceptibility to negative environmental factors--and the roots of their resiliency--ability to cope with biological and psychosocial risk factors. The study population consisted of all live births among ethnically Hawaiian, Pilipino, and Japanese residents. Public health officials, physicians, teachers, and social workers cooperated to collect the data. Findings indicated  that during the period of time which began with pregnancy and ended two decades later, the reproductive and care-taking casualities amounted to about half of those conceived and one-third of those born alive. In addition, three out of four children with four or more risk factors developed problems, while one out of four exhibited resiliency. Resilient children exhibited many stress-reducing characteristics. A follow-up study looked into resilient and high risk groups after 30 years, and determined the most stressful events and most successful coping mechanisms; the latter included: (1) genetically based dispositional attributes; (2) strong affectional ties to the family; and (3) external support systems that rewarded the individual's competencies.

        "description":"The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimates that the cost of S.249, the Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1987, will be, at most, 500 million dollars annually, a figure which reflects the cost of continuing health insurance coverage for employees on unpaid leave. S.249 is legislation which aims to provide to workers at firms with 15 or more employees a form of job protection that permits employees to take 18 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new or seriously ill child, and 26 weeks of unpaid leave for their own illness. The legislation requires that employers continue to offer health benefits for workers on unpaid leave on the same basis as if these employees were working. GAO believes that there will be few if any measurable net costs to employers resulting from a firm's  method of adjusting to the temporary absence of a worker taking unpaid leave under this legislation. To the extent that workers are already provided parental and extended disability benefits by firms or have either disability or parental leave benefits under existing state law, the costs to employers would be less than GAO's estimate. Estimated and discussed are specific costs of leave to care for newborn children, leave to care for seriously ill children, temporary medical leave, and employee replacement costs and productivity losses.

Time records were kept of infants' exposure to persons other than family members. Mothers completed Rothbart's (1978) Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Factor analysis revealed two factors in infants' social behavior, dominance and cooperation, which were very similar to &quot;like least&quot; and &quot;like most&quot; sociometric nominations in later years. Factor scores on  cooperation and dominance were correlated with observed interactive and orientation behavior of the target person and his or her partners in dyadic play sessions. Furthermore, factor scores on cooperation were related to mothers' responsiveness at home and in dyadic play sessions. Dominance was related to more involvement of mothers in peer play. Exposure to peers and to older children was differentially related to dominance and cooperation. Temperament appeared to be a minor factor in peer competence. (RH)",

The purpose of the GSRT, a commonly used screening instrument, is the assessment of children's developmental behaviors to aid in placement decisions for young children. However, typical use of the Gesell test differs from most screening procedures in that it is not followed by a more comprehensive assessment. A sample of 45 first graders referred by their teachers for developmental testing and a random sample of 106 students were tested with the GSRT. Whether the test was administered as part of a normal referral process or as part of the special administration to  a representative sample, each child's results were summarized as both a developmental age and a placement recommendation. Correlations were run on measured developmental age and student performance. A small positive relationship was found between Gesell developmental age and first grade report card grades. Additional outcome measures for a subgroup of the total sample indicated that the GSRT has modest predictive validity for standardized tests and low validity for teacher judgment of performance in first grade. Issues concerning misidentification of ready children and treatment efficacy are covered. It is concluded that the low predictive validity of the GSRT does not support its use for school readiness assessments leading to placement decisions. (RH)",

Four categories of learning are identified, namely, knowledge, skills, feelings, and dispositions. Presented is the view that young children learn most effectively when engaged in interaction with others in the classroom, with materials, and with their surroundings. The risks of early academic instruction are examined, and the importance of using a variety of teaching methods in an informal setting is stressed. Suggested is an intellectually oriented approach in which children interact in small groups as they work together on  projects which help them make sense of their own experience. (PCB)",

        "description":"To validate a new approach to research on the attachment behavior of children beyond toddler age, this study investigated relations between Q-sort outcomes and preschool children's affective perspective-taking; prosocial responsiveness to emotion; social competence, as rated by their teachers; and their mothers' expression and handling of emotions. Subjects were 18 children between 31 and 54 months of age and their mothers. Multiple measures were employed, including: (1) a puppet measure assessing children's affective perspective taking; (2) observation of children's prosocial reactions to emotions of peers; (3) peer sociometric ratings; (4) teacher's ratings of children's social competence on a behavior Q-sort and a problem behavior questionnaire; (5) diary records of maternal  emotional displays; (6) semi-structured interviews focused on maternal emotional coping methods; and (7) mothers' trained observation of children's behavior and subsequent completion of Waters and Deane's (1985) Attachment Q-sort. Scores were correlated with 36-month criterion sorts delineating the constructs of security of attachment, dependency, and sociability. Findings reinforced the organizational view of attachment and the validity of the measurement technique, suggesting that attachment Q-sort criterion scores are related to social-emotional competence and certain aspects of maternal emotional socialization.

        "description":"Rules for selecting participants of games are the starting point for creating a just community among preschool-aged children. At first glance, it seems impossible to create a just community among young children whose social perspective-taking is undifferentiated and egocentric, and whose sense of positive justice is similarly limited. However, preschool children do have a sense of the need to socially regulate the behavior of individuals in groups. This characteristic can be the basis for developing a just community among the very young. Preschool children playing games in which all members of a group can participate have to accept rules for playing the game and for finding and selecting players. Classroom teachers have an important role to play in transmitting selection rules to  children in playgroups. Negative consequences may occur when a teacher's way of opening a game is demonstrably unfair. A segment of a teacher-student interaction regarding the selecting of players for a group game in a preschool setting is interpreted in order to illustrate problems of justice which arise in the preschool.

        "description":"Evidence concerning the developmental correlates of nonmaternal care in the first year of life are examined with respect to infant-mother attachment and subsequent social development. Even though the evidence is not without its inconsistencies, a circumstantial case, consistent with attachment theory, can be made that extensive infant day care experience is associated with insecure attachment during infancy and with heightened aggressiveness and noncompliance during the preschool and early school-age years. It is concluded that entry into some nonmaternal care arrangement in the first year for more than 20 hours per week may be a risk factor in the emergence of developmental difficulties. The consequences of such risk are best understood in the context of characteristics of the  child, the family, and the caregiving milieu. A 90-item reference list concludes the document.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to review the research literature on effects produced by elementary school teachers and to identify implications of the findings for the early education of children prior to the first grade. Current issues in the research on teacher effects are discussed under the following headings: (1) teachers do make a difference; (2) learning occurs in multiple contexts; (3) students are active participants; (4) teachers are decision-makers; and (5) uses of the research on teaching. The review indicates that current research on teaching can inform early educators and researchers about the complexities of teaching and learning, and the importance of the teacher role. Implications are discussed in terms of purposes of early education, relevant findings from the  research on teaching, and relevant considerations for developing a research agenda for early education. Such considerations include the role of learning in development, the impact of different early childhood contexts, the changing nature of the child, and the changing nature of the teacher as decision-maker. It is argued that early education needs to move beyond its psychological and theoretical basis to develop an empirical base specific to early education in order to verify the assumptions early childhood makes about meaningful teacher practices.

Subsequent discussion presents New Mexico's involvement with corporate-supported child care and briefly describes conferences which bring together officials from business and government. Major options for child care which have been selected by corporations, and the advantages  and disadvantages of each option, are then described. Discussion focuses on multi-business centers, single-business centers, family satellite programs, corporate reserve slots, voucher systems, and information and referral services. Presently, child care reflects the Reagan administration's social policy shift from Federal responsibility to State and private involvement; therefore, several of the issues raised in the paper go beyond child care to address the role of business and employee benefits.

Participants were three normally developing infants, five children with Down syndrome, and their mothers. Normally developing children were all 7 months of age at the beginning of the study. Children with Down syndrome ranged in age from 7 to 23 months. Dyads were videorecorded at play twice per month over a year. Each tape was transcribed and coded on the child variables of onset of consonants and word use, and on the maternal response types: (1) phonetically contingent; (2) semantically  contingent; (3) noncontingent; and (4) no response. Reported results illustrate the advantages of microanalysis over whole-session analysis and of distinguishing between phonetic and semantic contingency. Although mothers of children with Down syndrome, as a group, were no less responsive or contingent to their children, they were much less phonetically contingent; that is, they rarely repeated or expanded their children's vocalizations. Microanalysis revealed that some of these mothers were even more semantically contingent to their children's first consonant productions than to other vocalization types. (RH)",

Problems were identified with interview data collected in three studies conducted in separate preschool and kindergarten classrooms. These data included typed transcriptions of taped formal interviews, notes taken by the researcher during formal interviews, and informal interview records contained in typed field-note protocols. The original studies followed Spradley's (1979; 1980) guides for conducting participant observation and ethnographic interview research. The four problems identified were: (1) the adult-child problem; (2) the right answer problem; (3) the  pre-operational thought problem; and (4) the self-as-social-object problem. Each problem is described using interview data in order to demonstrate how that problem may interfere with the construction of interview contexts and the collection of interview data. Concluding discussion identifies several strategies researchers can use to improve the quality of formal and informal interviews conducted with young children. (RH)",

The real value of farmland dropped 16% in Kentucky between 1981 and 1985. More farmers are seeking off-farm employment in order to continue family operations. Similarly, more farmers have returned to a tenant status to continue to farm. These trends will continue along with a &quot;back to basics&quot; approach to farming emphasizing reduced inputs, lower costs, diversification, and new market development. County extension offices can help farmers examine their financial situation including itemizing assets, debt to asset ratios, cash flow, debt service, future projections, and long-range planning. Extension offices can help  farmers reorganize their finances by prioritizing loans, establishing more realistic budgets, and discussing alternative methods of payment with creditors. State land grant universities provide farm management programs, options for alternative commodities, programs for farm families, and rural development efforts. Rural development strategies include encouraging farm-related enterprises, technical/managerial assistance for rural entrepreneurs, improving rural services, and natural resource management. Community organizations that can help farmers include schools, churches, farm organizations, chambers of commerce, human service organizations, job services, health agencies, and volunteer groups.

Supervisors had fairly accurate perceptions of foods children disliked but not of foods children liked. Most parents (75%) thought  lunches were reasonably priced, but 43% thought they could send a sack lunch cheaper. About one-third of the supervisors had problems getting adequate food service help. The distribution system and type of food offered through United States Department of Agriculture commodities were problems for 75% of the supervisors. In many districts parents did not receive adequate information about eligibility for free or reduced-price lunches, and anonymity for recipients of free or reduced-price lunches was a problem.

        "description":"Estimates were made of the effects of school lunch participation and various socioeconomic, anthropometric, and psychological variables on the consumption of 20 food items by 8- to 12-year-old children. The study sample consisted of 845 school children in the State of Washington, stratified by ethnic group and by poverty level so that it contained a higher proportion of Black, Mexican American, and below-poverty children than existed in the state. The sample consisted of 436 White, 215 Black, and 194 Mexican American children. Explanatory variables examined included height and weight of the child, household size, income, assets, ethnic group, age, sex, food attitudes, geographic origin, nutritional concern and basic need level of the person in the household responsible for food  preparation, whether or not the child had breakfast, and geographic location within the State of Washington. Children fully participating in the lunch program had a higher consumption of fluid milk, mixed dishes, canned vegetables, fats and oils, and sauces and toppings than nonparticipants. Full participants had a lower consumption of fresh fruit, bread and rolls, and cooked cereal. The question of whether these differences stem from school lunch participation or whether they stem from inherent differences in food consumption was examined. (JHZ)",

Results from 1972-73 surveys of 109 high school vocational/agricultural students, 93 community college farm management students, and 118 Washington State University farm management students revealed preferences for self-employed farming; desired size of farm on  which to work; attitudes toward farm employment related to school level, occupational choice, and residential background; and salary expectations. While 40% of students surveyed ranked self-employed farming as their first occupation choice, only 5% ranked working as a farm employee a first choice. They rated farm employment as markedly inferior to other occupations with respect to income, work environment, acceptance by others, recognition, and achievement. However, they believed farm employment provided more independence on the job and viewed the rural farm setting as a desirable environment in which to reside and raise a family. (NEC)",

Development of good listening skills (paraphrasing, perception-checking, questioning, pacing, summarizing) is recommended to facilitate classroom discussion on feeling-level topics. Suggestions for school activities to help relieve stress include writing essays, keeping journals, teaching relaxation responses, using puppets and role plays to act out situations, sharing situations and  feelings, using subject matter assignments related to the rural crisis, displaying articles and cartoons about the rural crisis on bulletin boards, starting classroom meetings/discussions on issues involving feelings and relationships. Described among symptoms of children/teenagers under stress are disorganization, lack of interest in self and others, preoccupation, sadness and crying, opposite behavior from usual, violence, regression, weight change, fear, fatigue, extreme obedience/compliance, absence from school. Extension publications, books, state and local agencies, and professional school personnel are listed as additional sources of help.

        "description":"The timing of three key family formation events--first sexual intercourse, first conception, and first marriage--was compared for different levels of urbanization. The levels of urbanization considered were central cities, suburbs, nonmetropolitan urban places, and rural area. Data were taken from the National Survey of Family Growth, for which interviews were conducted in 1982 with 7,969 women 15-44 years of age. Results suggested a continuation of urban-rural differences in family structure. Residents of rural areas and urban places outside of metropolitan areas begin sexual activity, conceive, and marry at younger ages than those who live in central cities or suburbs. Earlier initiation of sex and parenthood are largely a result of younger marriage. Premarital sex and  conception are no more common in less densely settled areas than in metropolitan centers. Early marriage commits women to family life at a younger age and increases the share of sexual activity and conception occurring within marriage. Results of the study suggest that the improvement of rural women's status may be inhibited by early family formation, and policies aimed at improving opportunities for rural women should take the prevalence of early marriage into account.

Patterned after the National Youth Leadership Council program, the Cherokee model provided training of selected high school youth in a challenging, multicultural camp setting, and created ways to &quot;bring back&quot; the motivation generated there and apply it to projects in home communities. Using the Janis-Field Self-Esteem Scale, scores were obtained before and after camp periods. While the 1982 and 1983 pre-camp scores of Cherokee youths were the lowest for all groups, the gains in mean  post-camp scores exceeded that for all groups combined for each year. When participants return home, CNYLP attention focuses on home community projects, operated by staff and students. These have had an important impact on the various communities. In 1983, 65 seventh and eighth graders attended the first Cherokee junior high camp, led by the high school leaders, thereby giving them the opportunity to test their newly-acquired leadership skills. Results show that important characteristics for effective Indian leadership are being demonstrated through the behavior of program participants. (JMM)",

Chapter Two outlines the program and resources, including personnel, facilities, and activities. Chapter Three portrays the critical routines of the school. Chapter Four gives student views of the challenges and demands of independence and responsibility. Chapter Five is devoted to student and staff accounts of interpersonal relationships and the troubles  that occur in an experiential program. Chapter Six describes the essential elements of Walkabout, a trip, and two passages. The final chapters put Mountain Open High School into a broader educational framework and extract lessons the school has for experiential education in general.

One potentially useful response is the creation of a state-rural policy center. Such centers can combine the efforts of land grant institutions, extension services, and state universities in the development and evaluation of rural policy issues and responses to the many changes occurring in the rural sector. Rural economic development efforts are needed that promote local government capacity building and attract business and industry to rural areas. Regional approaches, circuit riding professionals, cooperatives for production and marketing, and telecommunications technologies are some of the options that promote rural development and link the rural  sector and economy with the larger urban sector and global economy. Based on these issues and changes, several broad areas need focused attention and study in order to enhance the prospect of rural development: rural people and communities, economic development, local government finance, community services, natural resources and environment, rural values and social change, and educational outreach in rural areas. The rural development needs of Pennsylvania (the state with the largest rural population in the nation) and recent efforts in that and other Northeast states are cited. (NEC)",

Relative rates of urban and rural growth during 1960-70, 1970-80, and 1980-84 are compared. Shifts in the proportion of nonmetropolitan counties experiencing rural growth during 1980-84 are identified. The changing proportion of counties experiencing urban-rural deconcentration are documented. Temporal shifts in the character of nonmetropolitan urban-rural deconcentration are studied. Findings indicated that the 1970s saw a widespread pattern of population deconcentration within the country. This included population decline in the nation's largest cities, a continuing pattern of metropolitan suburbanization, more rapid  growth in smaller than larger Metropolitan Statistical Areas, population redistribution away from the densely-settled North, and a reversal in growth patterns between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The 1970s produced a widespread pattern of growth favoring rural over urban nonmetropolitan areas, affecting most areas of the country and types of counties. The unprecedented pattern of urban-rural deconcentration continued into the 1980s, despite a diminution in overall levels of nonmetropolitan growth and a return to faster overall metropolitan than nonmetropolitan growth. The interdependence between the demographic process and many interrelated aspects of the economy and society makes predictions about future population deconcentrations difficult. (NEC)",

        "description":"Problem solving has long been a concern of science educators, with many asserting that problem solving should be both the overriding method and valued outcome of science instruction in American schools. This information bulletin synthesizes studies that deal with the relationships between the teaching of problem solving and secondary school science curricula. The first section of the document notes some of the inconsistencies in the use of terms related to problem solving and adds that rather than define problem solving, the process by which solutions are obtained are categorized and described instead. In addition to the term problem solving, other related terms used by some researchers and practitioners include scientific method, scientific thinking, critical thinking, inquiry  skills, and science processes. The second section examines the large segment of the science education research which deals with problem solving as it relates to various aspects of instruction on students' problem-solving abilities. The third major section focuses on the concern that some science curriculum developers have had with problem solving. A variety of science curricula are described, particularly as they relate to problem-solving skills. A final section discusses implications for instruction. (TW)",

This program emphasizes the need to care for our soil. \"Something's in the Water\" (for grades 4-6) uses a fairy tale theme in which students help solve the mystery of a poisoned  water supply, and then role play in a town meeting to work out a solution to the problem. The last program described, \"One Rainy Day\" (for grades 6-9), involves the students in an exploration of the complex problem of acid rain. (TW)",

        "description":"The world presented to our senses is essentially continuous in space and time. The simplest observations of children have shown that we are not born with ways of \"breaking up\" the world. The structures of our knowledge must be developed, and the major issue this paper considers is how those structures develop. The discussion focuses on Jean Piaget's position and how it compares to several alternative positions. The alternative positions discussed hold in common that the structures of knowledge are copies of other structures. B. F. Skinner and Eleanor Gibson state that the structures of knowledge are copies of the structures of the world. Benjamin Whorf and the logical positivists believe the structures of knowledge to be taken from the structures of language. The Gestaltists  tried to reduce the structures of knowledge to the structures of perception. It is concluded that Piaget provides a theory in which structures of knowledge grow from previous structures of knowledge through action, disequilibrium, and equilibration. It is argued that further research is needed, however, for \"equilibration\" to become an explanatory rather than just a descriptive term. (TW)",

Metacognition has been defined as knowledge and cognition about cognitive objects and as any kind of monitoring. The ability to monitor one's thoughts and actions is greatly facilitated through the pair problem-solving method. Briefly, the method calls for one student to listen to another student solve a problem aloud. The listener may ask questions so as to understand each step and all the reasonings of the solver's solution. Modeled after the clinical interviews of Piaget, students learn self-monitoring skills while learning math concepts. Examples of verbal protocols from college freshmen illustrate the emergence of metacognition during clinical  interviews and during pair and group problem-solving in class. Finally, a description of a remedial math program at a major university provides practical applications of metacognition in the classroom. (Author/PK)",

        "description":"Numerous studies indicate that performance in solving single step multiplicative word problems is influenced by both problem structure and the types of numbers involved in the problem. For example, including numbers less than one often increases the difficulty of a problem. What remains unclear is how problem structure and number type interact in influencing difficulty. This study systematically investigated these two factors with math-proficient and remedial college students. Findings indicate that it is the role played by fractions in word problems that influences difficulty rather than simply the number of fractions in the problem. Pedagogical strategies for improving students' ability to perceive and represent multiplicative word problems are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This project was based on recent interview research which suggested that in choosing operations for story problems in mathematics many students are guided by computational considerations rather than meanings for the operations. This project aimed to refine the catalogue of strategies used by students and to design and test instructional materials intended to foster a concept-based approach to story problems among sixth graders. In the first year of the project (1985-86) students were interviewed, textbooks analyzed, a teaching experiment was conducted, and materials were developed and refined. During the second year materials were tried out, further textbook analysis was conducted and additional student interviews were conducted. The major sections included in this report are:  (1) the catalogue of strategies used by students in solving story problems; (2) what textbooks offer; (3) the teaching experiment with sixth graders; (4) the development of the supplementary materials; (5) the try-out of the materials; and (6) the spin-off studies. Four appendixes contain: a list of presentations and publications based on the project; the Story Problem Supplement; and reports to participating teachers of grades 8 and 6 concerning results of the experiment.

Each product selected for inclusion in this report is able to construct the graph of a given equation on the screen and serves as a utility which may be used by the student for an open-ended exploration of a mathematical concept or by the teacher as a demonstration tool. The products are classified into one of the following types: (1) general purpose graphing utilities; (2) demonstration tools; and (3) special utility programs. In general it was felt that the positive aspects of function plotters far outweigh the negative. The ability to automate the tedious process of plotting the graph of an equation enables students to examine more  equations in a shorter time. Teachers are able to spend less time sketching graphs on the overhead or blackboard. The zoom and scroll features found in many function plotters offer capabilities which cannot be duplicated manually. The report is organized into four sections including general features, algebra, coordinate geometry and trigonometry, and calculus. (PK)",

They tended to be tough, self-reliant, realistic, independent, and &quot;down to earth.&quot; Outstanding teachers appeared to be self-assured, confident, and accustomed to going their own way. Group characteristics were determined to include resourcefulness and a preference for making their own decisions. Their scores also indicated that they were venturesome and socially bold.

This research project investigated how workers from different cultural contexts value information that is relevant to their job performance. Thirty-five randomly selected mechanics, from Sweden, England, West Germany, Italy, and the United States, were selected as research subjects. This study was based on the premises that: (1) consciousness is related to knowledge and culture; (2) what people observe as essential for becoming conscious of their environment is accentuated by their verbal descriptions; and (3) use of natural language is the best method to express an intentional and oriented schematization process. The subjects were asked open-ended questions regarding organizational information  transfer and dissemination, and differences in subjects' responses by countries were emphasized and compared. Swedish workers related information use to their work-load within the context of ergonomic conditions, while English workers were conscious of the mediation of information. West German workers demonstrated the ability to acquire information, and Italians showed a need for persons to demonstrate how to choose correct alternatives. U.S. workers' consciousness centered around each individual's responsibility to gain access to information concerning the latest developments in his career field. U.S. workers' understanding of job goals was clear and direct. The study concluded that this moral point of view places the U.S. worker in an advantageous position in comparison to workers who  have been forced to relinquish responsibility or have not yet adopted it.

The literature concerning critical theory is discussed. Critical theory focuses on three areas of educational thought: (1) the relationship of school to society; (2) conceptions of knowledge and curriculum; and (3) the nature of teaching. Critical theorists argue that teachers should be the primary decision-makers about curricula, teaching strategies, and learning materials. The methods course developed by the authors promotes three goals: (1) empowering future teachers as creators of curriculum; (2) strengthening the link between critical viewpoints of education and teaching practice; and (3) encouraging reflective analysis as an integral aspect of  teaching and learning. The first two segments of the course are designed to help students explore basic questions of education and introduce the class to a critical approach for designing curriculum. The last three segments of the course expose students to various resources for and methods of teaching history and the social sciences within the elementary school. The problems associated with implementing critical theory are addressed and suggestions for solving these problems are offered. A bibliography is included. (Author/SM)",

The introductory discussion examines the theory that the state and consequently, the education system are seen as having the promulgation of the dominant class hegemony as an important part of its function. The document also traces the interaction between gender and education in the domestic curriculum, vocational opportunities, and the working conditions of women teachers. In the first three readings, Sara Delamont looks at ways to counter sexism during the child's formative years; Dale Spender discusses the different ways that males get more attention in the classroom; and R. W. Connell, D. J. Ashenden, S. Kessler and G. W. Dowsett point  out that schools differentiate between male and female students in ways which reinforce sex stereotypes. The results of the study carried out in 1974 by the Schools Commission on &quot;Girls, School and Society,&quot; is discussed in reading four. In reading five, Jean Blackburn discusses removing formal barriers to access to education for girls and boys, and in the final reading Jane Kenway and Sue Willis offer alternatives to single-sex schooling as a solution to unequal education. An annotated bibliography is appended. (SM)",

The introductory article gives the results of a survey of the 1971 innovative programs. The first six articles provide guidelines for undertaking innovative approaches in the classroom and overcoming obstacles to implementing new programs. Twelve articles give synopses of new programs in action in various schools throughout the state. New programs include global approaches to education, a law-related course, and an innovative economics course. The recurrent themes identified in these articles are: (1) learning occurs best by &quot;doing;&quot; (2) higher level thinking skills must have a large role in the classroom; (3) the cognitive developmental  stage of the student must be considered; (4) a pragmatic approach to curriculum development and implementation should be emphasized; and (5) students' understanding of their interdependence with other people of the world is important. The document concludes with: (1) a philosophy and rationale for social studies education in Michigan; (2) some pointers on constructing a K-12 social studies program; (3) an outline of suggested range and instructional focus for a K-12 social studies program; and (4) a seven step curriculum development model.

The SPA questionnaire covers the use of television, radio, and recordings as a means to participate in seven particular arts activities, which include jazz music, classical music, opera, musical stage plays or operettas, non-musical stage plays, ballet, and the collections of art museums or galleries. The data showed that well over half of all adults participated in at least one of the seven art forms either through television, radio, or recordings during the past year. Annual reaches of the SPA art forms through media are in most cases several times as great as the reaches of  comparable live events or activities. Media audiences for the arts consistently have an average higher income and education level and are more likely to live in urban areas. Residents of non-urbanized areas do not substitute media participation for live participation any more than do residents of urban areas. Overall, the media provides a window to the world of the most talented artists and arts organizations. Tables are used throughout the report to illustrate the findings. Appendices include the SPA questionnaire and the comparative demographic and geographic determinants of arts attendance and media use. (SM)",

Defining what the social studies field should be will help to answer the question of what should be taught. Questions of what children can learn in the elementary school years and what they need to know in order to form a sound foundation need to be addressed. A suggested sequence for grades seven through twelve might include: (1) grade 7 (geography); (2) grades 8, 9, and 10 (U.S. history and world history studied over a three-year period but with flexible scheduling of class meetings); (3) grade 11 (U.S. government and economics); and (4) grade 12 (U.S. problems and electives). More time and materials  are needed by teachers in order to prepare and implement better instructional strategies. Other issues that also need to be confronted by the Commission include: (1) teacher education; (2) the responsibility of academic disciplines in explicating themes, topics, concepts, and generalization of their disciplines; and (3) providing students with opportunities to apply knowledge to &quot;real life&quot; experiences within the school and community.

The sample used for this study was 475 world history teachers, randomly selected, in K-12 school districts scattered across Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. A 21-item questionnaire was mailed to each of the teachers. Responses were received from 195 teachers. The Statistical Analysis System (SAS) computer program for the social sciences was used to list the frequency distributions and to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and range for each of the variables taken from the questionnaire. From the study sample, it was determined that the amount of teaching time devoted to the study of Japan varies significantly among teachers. While  world history teachers spend between six to seven class hours teaching about Japanese history, little time is given to teaching about Japan's economic growth or about its role as a world trade leader. Teachers reported that only about one-third of their students are likely to view an educational film or filmstrip on Japan, and few of their students hear guest lecturers on Japan. However, teachers rank the importance of teaching about Japan rather high. Only teaching about Russia and China were rated as more important topics. (SM)",

The first effort at organizing the northwest occurred in 1784. Written by Thomas Jefferson, the Ordinance of 1784 defined the stages through which territories should pass to statehood, made membership in the confederation perpetual, outlawed slavery, and required that state governments should be republican. The Land Ordinance of 1785 solved the problem of the orderly distribution of land. The Northwest Ordinance, enacted by Congress on July 13, 1787, contained machinery for state making and the Articles of Compact. Provisions assuring freedom of religion, trial by jury, habeas corpus, security  of property and contract, proportional representation, public support of education, and the exclusion of slavery from the northwest in the territorial stage were included in the Articles of Compact. The ordinance required that &quot;utmost good faith&quot; should be shown toward the Indians. Their property was not be taken without their consent, and laws were to be passed to prevent injustices and to preserve the peace. (SM)",

        "description":"The Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which provided for government of the largely unsettled frontier area north of the Ohio River and for an orderly, three-stage transition of the territories from control by national government to full and equal statehood, joins the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution to form a trinity of founding-era documents that charted the course of a new nation. The Northwest Ordinance aroused conflict in Indiana and more broadly among U.S. citizens over slavery and sectionalism, states' rights, representative government, western expansion, and individual freedom. The Indiana Territory was created in 1800, and its first governor was William Henry Harrison. Many of Harrison's fellow settlers resented their lack of a voice in government and  pushed hard for transition to the second, semi-representative stage as promised in the ordinance. The force of numbers pushed Harrison to agree to movement to the second stage. The pattern of conflict was repeated in moving to the third stage although the conflict was more intense and enduring. A population census in 1815 counted 63,897 Hoosiers, more than enough to meet the requirements of the Northwest Ordinance for statehood. In 1816, 43 men wrote a constitution for Indiana, and on December 11, 1816, President James Madison approved statehood. The Indiana constitution of 1816 ended the controversy over slavery by making Indiana a free state. (SM)",

The FEM scale provides a measure of attitudes toward feminism and deals with acceptance or rejection of central beliefs regarding feminism rather than attitudes toward avowed feminists. Eighty-seven percent of the participants scored in the liberal direction on the FEM Scale, and 23 percent scored in the conservative direction. Participants who stated that the women's movement has had an impact upon their lives had more liberal  attitudes toward women. Males and females in this sample hold liberal values and attitudes toward women. Many of these college-age students would be willing to learn more about the women's movement and/or be a part of its promotion in the social-political environment. Implications are indicated for persons who work directly with university students. Opportunities should be provided to maximally encourage and promote successful student involvement in psychological, social, and political issues. (SM)",

The audience plays the part of travelers visiting a Philadelphia home in the late 1780s to learn more about everyday life, as well as about the events that took place in Philadelphia in 1787. The stage is simply set, using items that suggest the period. The script was developed from various publications available on the founding period. The two characters, Mary and Edwin Hopkins, are a middle-class couple with five children. Mr. Hopkins is a printer, and Mrs. Hopkins is a housewife who welcomes the visitors and  tells of the everyday duties of running her household, such as sewing and cooking. She tells the visitors how the Revolutionary War affected her family. Mr. Hopkins discusses his job and tells the visitors about the important documents he has printed. He describes the nation as it was during the 1780s, including the transportation system, communication, and different customs. The couple describe the major cities of that period, New York, Williamsburg, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina, and Philadelphia to the visitors.

        "description":"This study sought to determine if a professional course of study during teacher preparation in physical education had more influence on teaching effectiveness than a discipline-oriented course of study. The subjects were 41 undergraduates involved in two different physical education programs. The discipline-oriented course contained such subjects as kinesiology, motor learning, exercise physiology, and a number of skill-oriented courses. The professional program included foundations, kinesiology, two elementary methods courses, adapted physical education, and only four activity courses. The Academic Learning Time Observation System II was used to collect data on the subjects. No significant difference in overall teaching effectiveness was found between the two groups. Interns in  the profession-oriented course of study who were involved in at least two or three field experiences were not any more effective than the discipline-oriented group who were involved in their first field experience. The major recommendation derived from the study is to continue to monitor interns not only during student teaching but during the induction phase of teaching to help teacher educators ascertain the effect of professional preparation and its components.

Also, student teachers overwhelmingly stated that they would not consciously use negative reinforcement in the future.

Sixty-two secondary student teachers were administered the two instruments during a student teaching seminar half way through the student teaching experience. Analysis of Variance were performed on the overall stress score and nine subtest scores for each of the four learning styles. T-tests were performed on the concrete-abstract and the random-sequential continuums. Significance was found only in the subtest for Intrapersonal Conflicts with the sequential  learning styles. There was some evidence, although not significant, that there might be some relationship between stress and the abstract vs. concrete learner. This might warrent further investigation. (Author/JD)",

The program is grounded in research and theory about the nature and impact of the surrounding society upon schools, school personnel, and children, the effects of development and learning principles on schooling, and the impact of promising teaching practices. CITE highlights research findings that can be observed and/or applied in field settings. Structured field experiences are integrated with university instruction. The program evaluation will assess pedagogical knowledge and skills developed by teacher  education students, university faculty, and participating school teachers. Institutional outcomes will also be assessed. This report describes the program and project evaluation outcomes at Eastern Michigan University. Sample evaluation questionnaires are included and recommended revisions in the undergraduate teacher education programs at the university are appended. (JD)",

        "description":"The basic evaluation model for faculty is one in which quantitative information about the means of teaching, research, and service are tied to salary increases. However, faculty evaluation in this context is usually trapped conceptually between questions of fairness and questions of evaluation. Means and ends are distorted. On the other hand, if evaluation were correctly construed as the difference between aims and present accomplishments in light of those aims then it would seem that faculty evaluation would take on a perspective in which personal expression of the \"self\" is given major priority. The purpose of this presentation is to describe a humanistic model for appraising faculty performance. In this model, evaluation is understood in terms of what faculty are trying to do.  Evaluation is thus carried out by comparing actual accomplishments with desired outcomes in order to improve performance. This model of evaluation enables professors and administrators to work together to answer such evaluation questions as: (1) which objectives/aims are being achieved? (2) which aims are not being achieved? (3) what factors seem to be contributing to the success or failure in accomplishing these aims? and (4) what should be done to improve future performance?

The research focused on two questions: (1) Can raters from different backgrounds with different levels of training reliably use a rating scale based on the SCA skills? and (2) Which items on the scale discriminate most effectively among preservice teachers? Four raters, including a Director of Student Teaching, a Professional Supervisor, a communication education specialist, and a speech communication professor, reviewed 10 student teacher video-taped lessons. Analysis of the rater's evaluations indicated that the rating scale had potential for an acceptable level  of inter-rater reliability, and had some power to discriminate between effective and ineffective commuication behavior in student teachers. Suggestions are made for improving the efficiency of rating scales in team evaluation of student teacher communication competencies. Copies of the rating scales are included in the report. (JD)",

A formula was set for State funding of professional development programs. The Act also required each local school system to submit an annual comprehensive staff development plan designed to address the specific needs of the system and its personnel. In 1987, the Abbreviated Plan for Staff Development established, coordinated, and maintained programs that addressed, according to priorities, the assessed needs of certified school personnel only. Needs were considered from points of view of professional development and instructional effectiveness. These  needs were considered by school system administrators according to each of three stages of professional development: induction, remediation, and enrichment. This report provides statistical data from a survey of Georgia school districts on the progress, procedures and fund dispersements under terms of the Act as of January 1988. (JD)",

In particular, the research was designed to: (1) reveal new teacher motivations, attitudes, and expectations; (2) identify the concerns of beginning teachers and the support personnel most helpful to beginning teachers; (3) assess the impact of the teaching context on the first year of teaching; and (4) reveal what changes in teacher practice beginning teachers would make in a new year. During the course of the school year, the nine clinical support teachers in the induction program administered an interview at three different times to 18 beginning teachers. The interview consisted of seven open-ended questions on teacher motivation, teacher  attitudes, new teacher expectations, new teacher needs, sources of new teacher support, and the impact of the teaching context or teaching practice. An analysis of interview responses is offered and a comparison is made between these results and those of previous research on the topic. It is tentatively concluded that the teacher induction context may produce new teachers who are more motivated to continue teaching, more open to receiving support, and more focused on the instructional process during their initial teacher year. The verbatim interview questions and teaching characteristics are listed in tables. (JD)",

These elements were further coalesced into a set of guidelines concerning postbaccalaureate programs. These guidelines include: (1) students admitted into the programs must have a completed baccalaureate degree in an appropriate content area; (2) all students admitted must satisfy minimum entrance requirements; (3) students should enter the postbaccalureate programs as members of a  cohort, beginning enrollment in the summer session prior to the regular academic years; (4) students should devote the academic year to specific education courses and clinical experiences in elementary and/or secondary settings; (5) students should compete licensure requirements at the end of the first summer session following the regular academic year; and (6) students should not receive the master's degree at the conclusion of the initial pre-service training program. Additional coursework and applied classroom research should be required for the M.Ed. program. This paper clarifies the rationale for use of specific admissions procedures, discusses admission guidelines used for the pilot programs, and describes student-related data collected in the admissions process.

This information was obtained by means of a a 14-item questionnaire administered to 125 preservice teacher education students. The second study involved the administration of the Cultural Diversity Awareness Inventory as a pre- and post-test measure to preservice and inservice teachers who had taken three courses on the multicultural society and cross-cultural environments. The third research effort  focused on a program, &quot;The Minority Mentorship Project,&quot; in which undergraduate elementary education majors were linked as mentors with elementary minority students. An analysis of study results indicated that preservice teachers have limited experience and background in multicultural settings, but that a course devoted to multicultural content can raise sensitivity levels and cultural awareness.

Gathering information from teachers involved four steps: (1) teachers were interviewed about their plans for one instructional day; (2) teachers were each observed by a trained observer for all class periods of the day; (3) teachers provided observers with four to six samples of paper and pencil assessment instruments used recently; and (4) each was interviewed indepth after the day of observation. In both written and oral assessments, teachers focused nearly half of their assessments on the  simple recall of facts and information. Inference and analysis received less attention, and comparison and evaluation were almost ignored. Despite teachers' understanding of the importance of teaching students to think, they still require students to reproduce facts and information. Only mathematics emphasized thinking beyond mere recall. Teachers at various grade levels were surprisingly similar in their assessment patterns. (SLD)",

Although direct measures of the program's services do not show significant improvement in the status of foster children and foster parenting, it was found that the program does have an impact on the foster care community.  Recommendations based on the experience of the evaluators include support of database development and maintenance, improvement of county services coordination, providing of funding for planning and development as well as implementation of a program, close scrutiny of goals of short-term programs, attention of unintended consequences of programs, and continued evaluation of field-based social services.

        "description":"The Kentucky Career Ladder Commission has funded a special project on &quot;expected student achievement,&quot; to study the evaluation of teachers while avoiding the indefensible use of standardized student achievement tests. As proposed, the plan uses student achievement as one aspect of evaluation. The problem is in determining the degree to which student achievement, however defined, is attributable to any particular source. The project found that teachers value general and specific academic and non-academic outcomes. A common core of student achievement goals might be developed for evaluating teachers through professional consensus with weighted significance for each goal. The project has identified many problems associated with using student achievement test results as it has begun  to develop alternatives to the use of standardized test data for this purpose. The procedures piloted during the first year (1986-87) of the special project have potential for development as part of a teacher evaluation system which includes student achievement outcome data.

Role-playing success may have potential for a high level of ecological validity, but this is not ascertainable unless assessment is based on multiple samples of behavior.

The ideal, pedagogical view of forensics maintains that a forensics program should offer a broad range of activities, should be accessible to all interested undergraduate students, and should be viewed as humanistic education. However, institutional priorities often diminish the &quot;ideal.&quot; As research universities increase their pressures upon all faculty for research productivity, the time allocated for forensics becomes increasingly unrealistic. So the first two ideals of a program, being multi-faceted and appealing to all interested undergraduate students, are  likely to be eroded by the demand characteristics and evaluation procedures operating at graduate research universities. Additionally, the shift in the field of communication from a humanistic orientation to a social/behavioral science perspective tends to delegitimize the operation of a forensics program. While there should be a shift in the preparation of the next generation of forensics directors towards this social science perspective, there is some question whether the field of communication will be as accommodating of forensics programs in research universities.

Subjects, approximately 500 college students, completed measures of communication involvement, interpersonal communication apprehension (motivation), self-monitoring (knowledge), attentiveness, self-rated competence, and ratings of other competence (skill). The measures were completed before and after interaction  in one of two dyadic situations--acquaintance and task. Results indicated that the context-independent measures did not contribute significant variance to the model. However, both the context-specific measures of skill contributed substantial amounts of variance in all of the predictions.

Each student was asked to find a willing conversational partner, to decide upon a conversation they had recently, and--without consulting with each other--to complete a questionnaire about that conversation. The questionnaire was composed of scales intended to measure perceptions of a partner's communication competence, perceptions of one's own competence, and self-monitoring behavior--the tendency of individuals to focus on internal or external cues for regulating self-behavior. It was hypothesized that self-rated competence would be positively related with self-ratings of other's competence and that self-monitoring  would be positively associated with self-rated competence. Results, however, did not support these hypotheses. Self-monitoring appeared to have little effect on other-competence or on the correlation between self-competence and other-competence. Collectively, the findings indicate that the self-monitoring construct does not significantly predict competent interaction but may combine with competence to predict possible outcomes of competent interaction.

        "author":["Tarver, Jerry"],
        "description":"In response to a need for writers in corporations who are able to construct well-written speeches, a format for a speech-writing seminar for corporate writers has been developed. First, there are two kinds of seminars: open, for which anyone could register; and in-house, which is conducted for a specific company or organization. Second, in devising seminar content, the units begin with background on the history and current status of speech writing, then progress to more specific information on such topics as the writing process, organization of ideas, or language. Third, there are three basic elements in conducting a seminar: (1) a solid base of techniques and theory, (2) writing exercises to illustrate key techniques, and (3) opportunities for writers to interact. Although  similarities exist between conducting a seminar and teaching in a classroom, the seminar calls for a high level of energy and perhaps more humor than the classroom. (Brochures from nine competing organizations which conduct seminars are included.) (DF)",

A 40-item classroom communication climate questionnaire was developed, and administered to 76 students and 8 teachers to determine its reliability and validity. After several changes and deletions, the final version of the questionnaire was administered to 200 students and 7 teachers from classes in speech and hearing sciences, biology, speech, and journalism. Although analysis of the data seems to emphasize openness on the teacher's part and the ability of the teacher to teach dramatically as factors affecting classroom communication, the validity of some of the measures used must be questioned. Therefore, further research in this area is necessary. (DF)",

        "description":"The Communication Competency Assessment Instrument (CCAI) was developed as a college-level communication competence measure. However, because the listening portion of the CCAI requires individual testing and is not practical for large-scale testing situations, an additional multiple choice measure was developed. In a study conducted at Kent State University, 339 students in introductory speech communication classes completed three listening measures: the Kentucky Comprehensive Listening Test, the Watson-Barker Listening Test, and the open-ended (OE) and multiple choice forms of the CCAI. Analysis of the students' scores indicated that there are many similarities between the Kentucky and the Watson-Barker tests, but that the strongest relationship among the listening tests exists  between the Watson-Barker Listening Test and the CCAI-OE. Comparison of these three tests has shown that listening to an audiotape may differ from receiving the stimulus through videotape or in actual performance and that the questions must be worded accurately. Several additional concerns have been discovered and should be addressed in listening test construction and development. (DF)",

Furthermore, most of the schools and courses are in the same geographical location at the Maxwell/Gunter complex in Montgomery, Alabama. There are basic differences among the services in their education programs, but all of the services put a value on good communication skills for officer, enlisted, and civilian personnel. For the Air Force, the emphasis on communication skills is especially evident in PME. For enlisted personnel, the program is four-tiered: at the Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Preparatory Course, 35 of the 60 hours focus on leadership, management, and communication skills; 25  hours out of the 143-hour course at the NCO Leadership School curriculum focus directly on communication skills; 33 hours out of a 216-hour course at the NCO Academies are spent in communication skills; and at the Senior NCO Academy, 39 of the 320 total hours in the course are devoted exclusively to communication skills. Similar dedication to communication skills is given in the three-tiered approach used for officers. The military believes that the ability to communicate effectively is so important that no one ever gets past the place in life where there is no need to sharpen these skills. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare Brazilian men and women managers' preferences for using communication versus power-centered strategies when resolving employer/employee disputes. Subjects were 40 men and 40 women in middle and top-management positions. Each manager read a packet of four scripts describing various problems that a manager might have with an employee or fellow manager. Results showed no evidence in any of the scenarios that either men or women managers intended to behave differently toward male than toward female employees. Analysis of two of the scripts indicated that Brazilian men and women managers did not differ significantly in the ways in which they would attempt to resolve disputes with employees who were disgruntled because they were being asked to do  something not in their job descriptions. Male and female managers were nearly equally divided in their preferences for using communication, power, or some combination thereof in attempting to resolve disputes with employees. Brazilian women were somewhat more likely than men to use some form of communication when attempting to resolve disputes with employees who had apparently violated chains of command. However, both men and women managers identified power as the preferred mechanism for resolving this particular dispute. Appendices include all four scripts (in both English and Portuguese), examples of the three response modes, and six tables showing the study data. (HTH)",

Specifically, the study investigated the effects of variety, autonomy, task identity, feedback, dealing with others, and friendship opportunities on the network role enactment of isolates (employees with few relationships within the organization), liaisons (those with links to two or more groups), and group members (employees who have more ties with each other than with other organizational members). Results of a discriminant analysis procedure supported the idea of the overall influence of task characteristics on role enactment. In particular: (1) autonomy and identity were associated with the  role of isolate; (2) variety was associated with group members; and (3) feedback and dealing with others were associated with liaisons. Friendship opportunities failed to discriminate among the roles. (FL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to assess the dimensions of a National Public Radio (NPR) audience's interests in programing, and how these interests define subaudience groups. Telephone surveys were conducted with 276 persons who were over 18 years of age and who usually listened to the local university operated NPR station at least one day per week. The results of a cluster analysis reflect the premise and programing strategy of NPR broadcasting: that NPR's mission is to serve a number of different minority tastes by offering block programing. For example, the subjects' local station plays blocks of classical music in the morning and early evening, bluegrass in the afternoon and jazz at night. Correspondingly, as the distinctive clusters suggest, an NPR audience is much more  heterogeneous than that of a commercial outlet which continuously offers a specific format. The public radio schedule attracts an audience of subgroups whose allegiance to the station is partial, confined largely to interest in and support of a particular type of programing which is available only some of the time. In contrast to commercial radio listeners, NPR listeners' satisfaction with and loyalty to their stations are undercut, or at least discouraged, by the philosophy and tactics of public radio broadcasting. While this is no disparagement of NPR's unique alternative service, it is surely a factor in public radio's small audience shares and perennial difficulties in securing direct listener support.

        "description":"The overall focus of this booklet is on planning for change that allows for integration of computers into articulated learning environments that will enhance the learning goal of students. The first chapter presents four major themes to increase the likelihood of combining computers and individualized instruction in schools: (1) a revitalized form of computer-assisted instruction (CAI); (2) the utilization of computers by students for their own learning goals; (3) the use of a comprehensive instructional management system; and (4) the willingness of educators to provide alternative educational environments in harmony with technology. Chapter 2 begins the discussion of CAI with a brief history and moves to the four levels of CAI that range from drill and practice to systems that  create a model for each student and modify it as learning progresses. Chapter 3 presents a Student-Computer Integrated Learning (SCIL) model that shifts the focus from students being passive recipients to their use of computers as a medium for learning. This model makes extensive use of computer-based simulations. Ways to reorganize schools consistent with SCIL that would personalize an individual's educational experiences are suggested in chapter 4. In chapter 5, a 4-year training program, using the &quot;coaching&quot; model, is proposed for educators and administrators to transfer skills to the educational process. The last chapter describes the need for a sophisticated instructional management system--Educator-Computer Integrated Management (ECIM)--to keep track of the progress of each student.  Three pages of references complete the booklet. (MLF)",

The principals fell into three leadership categories: &quot;Initiators,&quot; who seek change in accordance with long range policies and goals; &quot;Responders,&quot; who focus on traditional administrative tasks and immediate needs; and &quot;Managers,&quot; who support innovation in response to external pressures. The principals' goals for staff development as an aspect of curriculum improvement varied according to their leadership styles: Responders emphasized cognitive goals, Initiators did not value cognitive goals, and Managers focused on evaluative goals. Background factors affecting leadership styles included the impact of  managerial training on Managers, the influence of autodidactic knowledge on Initiators, and interest among Responders in practical implications of curriculum implementation. Organizational factors included the tendency for established, government-operated schools to foster Initiators. Other factors tested were strategy and policy factors. Although the multiple regression analysis used did not prove all of the factors to be predictive, those that were predictive accounted for 20 percent of the variance in the Responders, 31 percent of the variance in the Managers, and 48 percent of the variance in the Initiators.

        "description":"The &quot;new federalism&quot; policies of the conservative governments of Malcolm Fraser in Australia (1975-1982) and Ronald Reagan in the United States (1980-1985) are remarkably similar. Both men rode to power on the wave of conservative political, economic and social forces which swept the United States and Australia in the late 1970's. Both espoused &quot;new federalism&quot; policies which included such common elements as transferring more power and financial responsibility from the national government to the states; reducing the huge federal deficits by cutting federal expenditures--primarily in social welfare and related areas; and deregulation of federal &quot;red tape&quot; in dealings with industry and the states. These broader policies affected education when both leaders sought with varying  degrees of success to reduce the federal role in education significantly through (1) strategies for reducing federal education spending; (2) organizational changes aimed at eliminating or weakening federal education agencies; (3) politicization of the personnel of federal agencies; and (4) policies fostering private schooling at the expense of public schooling. The two leaders found limited success in achieving their &quot;new federalism&quot; goals in education, and a continued role for the federal government in education can be foreseen in both countries.

        "description":"Analysis of the responses to telephone and personal interviews by 21 teacher supervisors from six school districts in Pennsylvania revealed three possible patterns of direct supervision of teachers. &quot;Nominal&quot; supervision consists of voicing compliance with statutory requirements for observation of teaching, a clear focus on identifying and eliminating substandard teaching, and a view of the supervisor as &quot;quality control inspector.&quot;&quot;Patterned&quot; supervision uses a highly structured system of observation and communication to help all teachers improve teaching beyond state-mandated minimums, follow uniform teaching procedures, and make improvements in areas other than those affected by other interventions. &quot;Integrated&quot; supervision combines patterned supervision with other approaches  to professional development and adapts the process to the specific needs of the setting and the teachers served. This report describes the supervisory and staffing patterns followed in each of the districts studied, places the study in the context of a larger study of supervisory practices in Pennsylvania, and explains the study's planning and interviewing methods. (Confidentiality was preserved by giving the districts fictional names). The development of techniques for analyzing the data are described, with supporting evidence from the interviews. The complete interview questionnaire and selected responses are presented in appendixes. (PGD)",

        "description":"The informal efforts of principals to encourage the professional development of teachers may be more significant than the formal programs. The Instructional Management Project was undertaken by Far West Laboratories (San Francisco, California) to increase understanding of these informal efforts. One aspect of the research involved school observations and interviews with selected school principals, teachers, and students, as well as the administration of the Instructional Organization Instrument. The principals' routine behaviors were assigned to nine categories: goal setting and planning; monitoring; evaluating; communication; scheduling, allocating resources, and organizing; staffing; modeling; governing; and filling in for other staff members. The targets for these actions were  also categorized: work structure, staff relations, student relations, safety and order, plant and equipment, community relations, and institutional ethos. All principals spent over half their time communicating. Those who effectively encouraged staff professional development focused comparatively heavily on professional matters in informal exchanges. Six kinds of informal activities of principals were found typical of efforts to initiate or reinforce teacher development: disseminating information about formal development opportunities; disseminating professional materials; focusing professional interest around specific themes; soliciting teacher responses to educational concerns; encouraging experimentation and innovation; and publicizing teacher achievements. Examples of such behaviors  are cited, and a three-page bibliography is included. (PGD)",

The state finance system, which previously distributed state aid according to a district's allotment of personnel units, was changed to a weighted pupil system under the new law. Topics discussed include the price differential index, small district adjustments, weighted pupils, results of the Texas program cost differential study, the effects of weighting students by special program area, the transportation allotment, allotments for educational improvement and career ladders, and the state and local share of  program costs. The next section is a discussion of fully funded state programs: the Equalization Transition Fund, the Enrichment Equalization Allotment, and the Experienced Teacher Allotment. The final section discusses the results of a Fall 1985 survey of Texas school districts. References are provided, along with 13 tables providing the numerical data on which the discussion is based.

A brief synopsis of each study describes the basic features and assumptions of the IOA's, the study methodology, and the primary findings and interpretations. The cross-study synthesis is then organized around three topics: (1) classification of IOA's according to legal status of the IOA itself and the improvement effort it supports; (2) comparison of various types of IOA's by history, context, structure, operations, and  outputs; and (3) a synthesis of key findings, including general cross-study findings and predominant cross-study outcomes in six categories: power and status changes, linkage changes, knowledge transfer, capacity building, practice improvement, and institutionalization. In the final section, implications of the synthesis are provided, respectively, for managers, policymakers, and researchers concerned with educational dissemination and school improvement.

A number of broad-based attempts to apply the Hatch Amendment to instructional programs are happening nationwide. Several conservative organizations distributed to some 250,000 parents a &quot;model letter&quot; that enumerated activities comprising 34 topics that the groups believe parents are entitled to review and approve before their children participate in them. The National School Boards Association (NSBA) supports the objective that school  systems inform parents of experimental programming and not engage in psychological testing and treatment without parental consent. The NSBA found that over three-quarters of 386 school systems surveyed already had such policies and is urging that the &quot;confusing and unnecessary&quot; Hatch regulations should be withdrawn and the legislation repealed. To be certain that school system policy conforms with the requirements of the Hatch Amendment, board members are advised to assess policy and see that it gives parents the legal right to inspect all instructional materials. The policy should contain a fair procedure for dealing with complaints and require that complaints, acknowledgments, and decisions all be in writing. (MLF)",

Future preventive measures which will reduce moderate and severe retardation in the U.S. population are envisioned to include utero surgery or fetal therapy to treat problems causing brain dysfunction. Improved treatment of secondary symptoms of retarded persons is also predicted. The acceleration of the normalization principle and the resulting deinstitutionalization is noted. Effects of past definitional changes on the incidence of mental retardations are discussed, and projections are made for future prevalence to be as low as 1% of the general  population.

The ages at entrance to school of a group of 67 learning disabled (LD) students (7-12 years old) and a group of 67 systematically selected students from the same school district (Oil City Area, Pennsylvania) were examined and compared. The LD group showed a moderate tendency to be younger than their peers when starting school. This seemed to indicate that immature, developmentally young children were at risk of being identified as learning disabled. Retention or staying home for an extra year before entering school is  presented as a viable alternative to being identified as handicapped. The importance of individual assessment to determine school entrance is stressed. (Author/CL)",

The underlying cause of the academic or behavioral deficit is usually ascribed to one of three categories: (1) lack of prerequisite skills; (2) lack of motivation; or (3) lack of physical ability to perform the behavior necessary to demonstrate mastery of the skill. Each of the categories is addressed in terms of identification and treatment. Attention is given to ways to reduce inappropriate behaviors in mainstreamed children and to replace the problem behaviors with more appropriate ones. Principles of behavior are reviewed, and three purposes of behaviors are considered: attention, avoidance of task, and self stimulation. Intervention suggestions are noted. (CL)",

Chapter 1 outlines the various types of early FL programs that have been implemented, such as foreign language experience (FLEX) programs, foreign language in the elementary school (FLES) programs, and immersion programs. These are discussed with respect to goals, the degree of integration with the total curriculum, and the roles played by English and the foreign language. Chapter 2, on rationale, discusses two perspectives: that of the first wave of early FL programs in the 1950s and 1960s, according to which earlier language study was always better, and that of the current  wave, which acknowledges both the advantages and disadvantages of early foreign language learning. Chapter 3 discusses research evidence on the effectiveness of early FL programs in light of current second language acquisition theory and suggests areas for future research. Chapter 4 focuses on the procedures involved in program implementation, from the establishment of a steering committee to the formulation of evaluation procedures. Chapter 5 presents basic concepts in evaluation design and an outline of evaluation procedures. Chapter 6 notes areas needing further study, and Chapter 7 provides a bibliography and a resource list.

LOGO was chosen because of its similarity to natural language and its method of structuring data. The first use was in an experimental linguistics seminar, in which the computer was used to expose students to a way of thinking relevant to language and to its use as a tool for conducting linguistics experiments. The computer use was found to be successful in promoting interactive learning and divergent thinking, and in getting across several basic concepts to be used in later courses. Use of computers and of LOGO in education in general is supported because of their ability to promote divergent rather than  convergent thinking, and development of a game grammar with even more flexibility than LOGO is seen as a next step.

The approach was devised for a university program of non-credit intensive academic English courses. The students in the program were a heterogeneous group with a wide variety of characteristics and needs, and the syllabus was undeveloped. The procedure involved teachers' identifying specific student learning problems from classroom behavior, circulating the information to colleagues for comments and instructional strategy suggestions, and discussing the problems in regular meetings. After an initial six-month period, an informal  consensus regarding teachers' perceptions of student problems was reached, and a wide variety of relevant teaching techniques or behaviors for classroom interaction had been implemented. Faculty in a similar program at another university also reviewed the information, and the results closely approached the original faculty group's ideas. This approach to faculty development has the advantages of integrating professional growth into the administrative decision-making process and of being managed by the program staff itself. (MSE)",

The assignment was made in the form of a fictitious letter from the university president requesting that the recipients form a committee to prepare a joint report on the subject. The letter outlined a tentative working schedule and provided supporting documents. The students chose to work independently on a study of the different faculties and to combine their findings into a full report later. Class meetings were spent  outlining strategies, discussing problems and methodology, and giving progress reports. The assignment had the multiple advantages of providing motivation for students to work on a joint project while focusing on their own individual writing development, using useful technical writing skills, and learning more about their academic fields.

        "description":"The instructional settings and teacher-learner relationships observed in English-as-a-second-language classes at the secondary and university levels in Poland by an American senior Fulbright lecturer are characterized by very formal instruction with heavy emphasis on pronunciation and grammar exercises, large classes with little opportunity for individual participation beyond answering questions and reading passages aloud, and no visual aids other than maps and scenic posters. However, motivation to study English is strong. The university's program for English majors is an immersion program, broad-based in content but generally amethodological. Student-teacher relationships are extremely formal, often adversarial. Texts are limited and must often be shared, and although there are  film projectors and a language laboratory at the university, materials are limited. Administration of American standardized language proficiency tests revealed a relatively high proficiency level despite the instructional format and limited amount of time spent in language study. By the third year of university language instruction, standardized test scores are in the 91st percentile. The main conclusion from these findings and observations is that, before any comprehensive theory of second language learning can be developed, it will be necessary to investigate the learning process as it occurs in a variety of pedagogical and cultural settings.

The utility and effectiveness of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages/Educational Testing Service Oral Proficiency Interview in this context were also examined. Use of this instrument was found to be feasible at the college level, providing the benefits of more  objective evaluation of oral skills, potential for increased student motivation, and a positive impact on curriculum, materials, and instructional techniques development. It is suggested that the process may be even more useful at the department level. Answers to questions often asked by faculty about the procedures and results of oral proficiency testing were provided, and additional questions emerged for further investigation. (MSE)",

Foreign student enrollments have increased dramatically in these three countries in the 1960s and 1970s, and foreign students also make up a significant proportion of total student enrollments in each of the three countries. Britain and France heavily enroll students from former colonies. Each of the countries has experienced disproportionate enrollments from a limited number of foreign countries. Policies adopted for foreign students reflect, in part, the influence of immigration issues and attitudes toward ethnicity. Each of the countries has recently altered its  policies to restrict and control the flow of foreign students, using tuition or entrance requirements. In 1980 Great Britain decided to impose full-cost fees on foreign students. One rationale for Germany's positive foreign student policies is the importance of strengthening the educational and technical capacity of underdeveloped countries in order to increase their buying power and to assist in achieving world peace. Foreign student policy is closely intertwined with a nation's educational policy and systems, economic conditions, demographic projections, internal social pressures, and foreign policy and foreign trade priorities.

The skills that 16- to 24-year-old youth generated in the 1980-1981 year were estimated, along with the postsecondary awards and degrees that this age group would earn between 1984 and 1995. Skill projections were derived from the amounts of education completed and the fields of study. The quality of skills of high school graduates was also analyzed, based on comparisons of the 1972 and 1980 graduating classes. Four types of data were assessed to determine whether youth show the flexibility required to respond to skill shortages and oversupplies: intended fields of study, the levels and fields of completed degrees, and rates of occupational  and geographic mobility. Five characteristics of the postsecondary system that seem to facilitate its adaptiveness were identified: the number of different institutions and sectors, substitution between them, heterogeneity among them, student geographic mobility, and the internal organization of the institutions in major sectors of the system. Problems that affect the educational system's ability to respond to changes in training requirements were identified, along with policy issues. Statistical findings are included. (SW)",

In &quot;The Community College in the American Educational System,&quot; Arthur M. Cohen considers transfer education and different missions of the college (i.e., graded education and quasi-educative services). Robert Birnbaum's paper, &quot;State Colleges: An Unsettled Quality,&quot; argues that identity is a key issue for state colleges as they struggle to balance their role as &quot;agencies of the state&quot; and their commitment to academic values. The  situation of the liberal arts college, which is no longer preeminent, is discussed by Allan O. Pfnister in &quot;The American Liberal Arts College in the Eighties: Dinosaur or Phoenix?&quot; According to Pfnister, shifting funding patterns will be especially hard on tuition-dependent small liberal arts colleges. In &quot;Research Universities: Their Role in Undergraduate Education,&quot; Roger L.

Both programs, the College Housing Loan Program (CHLP) and the Academic Facilities Loan Program (AFLP), were created by Congress in response to upsurges in college enrollments. CHLP provides loans for such purposes as building new housing and the conversion or renovation of existing structures, while the AFLP allows for the construction, reconstruction, and renovation of academic facilities. Loans under the programs have been at low interest rates (about 3 percent) and long terms (up to 40 years). Study objectives were to determine: the efficiency of the Department's management of the programs, violations of law and  regulations by borrowers participating in the programs; the adequacy of the Department's procedures for handling colleges in default on their federal loans, and the advisability of a departmental regulation to allow discounted prepayment of program loans during fiscal year 1984.

Problems rated most severe by  Hispanic students concerned institutional and organizational aspects of graduate study life.

After discussing the size and scope of efforts to train employees, reasons for corporate training are identified. Four dimensions of the corporate learning enterprise are considered: in-house educational programs, educational and training facilities, degree-granting institutions, and the satellite university. Specific topics include: facilities for corporate education; educational structure; the position of the training program in the company; teaching methods in the corporate classroom; research into how people learn; basic skills instruction; the education of managers and  executives; technical and scientific training; sales, service, and customer training; general education; overlap with the educational establishment; and the quality of corporate courses. For 18 corporate education institutions information is provided on: program location, sponsor and history, type of institution, date established and date degree approved by state, nongovernmental accreditation, and degrees awarded. A bibliography is included. (SW)",

A model for examining such activities and a framework for designing and implementing a faculty development workshop are also examined. Popular faculty development efforts include: faculty mentors for new faculty, conferences or seminars on the theories and concepts underlying teaching, grant or leave programs, and newsletters and articles on college instruction. A chart distinguishes between low and high risk types of faculty development activities in terms of such factors as whether attendance is voluntary, whether the faculty needs to be passive or active, and moderate or high time requirements. Low risk activities are those familiar to individual faculty  that are not perceived as a threat to their competency or ego. Starting faculty development efforts that are low risk helps to gain credibility and support for any type of program. Gradually, a more collaborative approach to faculty and institutional development can be put into action. A workshop for faculty that responds to their needs is one way to start a faculty development program. In addition to issues in planning a faculty development workshop, content that might be included in a workshop on adult students is identified. (SW)",

        "description":"To assess depression in college students, two inventories were compared: the Student Experience Inventory (SEI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). SEI, a self-report questionnaire, contains 56 items that are designed to measure hopelessness and decreased energy levels, as well as five factors covered in BDI: (1) negative affect toward self, (2) negative physiological symptoms, (3) general unhappiness, (4) performance difficulties, and (5) loss of personal and social interest. Unlike BDI, SEI is worded to reflect specific, common college experiences, as well as the duality of phenomena (e.g., physiological reactions). SEI uses a counterbalancing of items to lessen the probability of response bias. Items within the SEI were analyzed using item-total correlations. The four  items with the highest item-total correlations within each of seven subdomains were selected for inclusion in the SEI. Coefficient alpha was also computed to assess internal consistency, and a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated to assess concurrent validity. The SEI appeared to measure a construct similar but not identical to the construct measured by BDI. The results suggest that further development of SEI may allow for the assessment of those aspects of depression specific to the college population. The SEI is appended. (SW)",

Up to the 19th century, the bachelor of arts degree was a preprofessional degree; the Ph.D. degree was introduced after the Civil War. Since the doctoral degree emphasized research skills, universities began to employ research-oriented faculty members, and departments gained control over the curriculum. With industrialization, there was increased demand for specialization, new scientific knowledge, and new occupations. Additional factors that influenced the curriculum included: the land grant college movement, the G.I. Bill, desegregation legislation, increased college enrollments during the 1960s, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam protest period,  increased enrollment of nontraditional and foreign students, and legislation regarding the handicapped. Important issues in the 1980s include technological innovations, the growing trend to change careers, financial problems facing colleges, underprepared college students, and declining enrollments. Curriculum models that focus on the following are distinguished: subject matter, student experience, cultural heritage, objectives or outcomes, individualized study and student needs, and the future.

An instrument to assess task performance was devised as a survey mailed to 376 field, outpost, child health, and school health nurses employed by the Western Australia Health Department. Responses from 96 participants on 3 survey days categorized tasks according to number and type of tasks performed, source of initiation (self, supervisor, client, other) and perceived degree and source of preparation for task performance. The questionnaire also gathered information on the nurses' perceptions of educational needs and role requirements. Analysis of responses according to functional, educational, and experiential  categories suggest that task performance is context specific, rather than dependent on education or experience level. It was recommended that several content areas be added to existing community health nursing curricula. Improvement in educational service delivery to nurses practicing in nonmetropolitan areas was also recommended. A literature review was conducted covering historical developments pertinent to nursing education in Australia and abroad, education needs for the current role of the CHN, and educational preparation of the CHN. The questionnaire is included. (Author/SW)",

Attention is directed to program review practices at 30 representatives institutions. As background, predominant types of program review over the past 15 years levels are briefly addressed: state-review, multicampus system review, and college review. At the college level, major issues include: choosing programs to review, accommodating multiple purposes, selecting an evaluation model, assessing quality, using external reviewers, increasing use of evaluations, and assessing the impact of evaluations. Program reviews at most institutions draw heavily on one or more of several models: goal-based,  responsive, decision-making, or connoisseurship. Four different perspectives have been offered on how quality should be defined: the reputational view, the resources view, the outcomes view, and the value-added view. Criteria for evaluating programs include: quality of faculty, students, curricula, support services, the relevance of the program to mission, student demand and demand for graduates, and costs. Ten tentative proposals for improving program review are offered that relate to purposes, processes, and use of results. (SW)",

The 1980 report made suggestions to ensure that U.S. foreign medical graduates received education and training comparable to that provided by U.S. schools. The followup study involved interviewing medical licensing authorities in four states that were visited in developing the 1980 report: California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York. Meetings were also held with members of seven private organizations that are responsible for testing and certifying the foreign medical graduates. Officials at the Department of Education, Department of  Health and Human Services, and Veterans' Administration were interviewed. In addition, two conferences were convened to discuss issues and possible solutions to problems arising from foreign medical graduates. GAO found that none of its 1980 report recommendations had been implemented. Although private agencies took some initiatives (e.g., obtaining information about foreign medical schools for state licensing boards), GAO suggests two alternative courses of legislative action that could promote a more coordinated approach to address problems. These suggestions concerned accrediting foreign medical schools, and reviewing credentials of foreign graduates. (SW)",

During the 1970s and 1980s, the 14 states making up the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) region experienced explosive growth in physician supply relative to that of the nation. The region's rate of growth in the number of medical school graduates also surpassed the nation's. There are considerable variations in growth rates among the SREB states and in the distribution of physicians within the states. The more urban states not only had greater increases in the number of physicians, but physicians tended to be better distributed; the predominantly  rural states experienced a persistent maldistribution of physicians. Many SREB states need to reassess their medical education needs in view of the South's increased retention of its medical school graduates and increased in-migration of physicians from outside the South. However, minority physicians, particularly black physicians, are underrepresented in relation to the proportion of minority population in the region. Focusing attention on graduate medical education programs and recruiting minority medical students are recommended. (SW)",

        "description":"The need and demand for new doctoral nursing programs in the South was assessed, using data collected by the Southern Council on Collegiate Education for Nursing (SCCEN). To learn how many doctoral nurses are now employed and how many are anticipated to be needed by 1990, SCCEN surveyed all collegiate nursing education programs in the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) region, as well as the larger (over 250 beds) hospitals, and state health agencies. Doctoral-level nurses were needed as faculty for college nursing programs and as leaders in the health care system. Without any additional doctoral programs, the SREB region will be short by 91 doctoral nurses by 1990, and the region will fall short by between 21 and 84 entering positions for doctoral students per year during  1985-1990. However, five of the six existing doctoral nursing programs in the region have no waiting lists of qualified applicants, and about 20% of the enrollments in these programs are from out-of-region. While there is a need for more doctoral students each year, it is doubtful that student demand will justify educational expansion. Background information on nursing education in the SREB states is provided for each level (associate, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral). Current plans for doctoral programs and resource requirements are also reviewed in detail. (SW)",

        "description":"Issues concerning declining college enrollments of black students are addressed, with attention to: the need for both access and quality, trends affecting college enrollment, and targets for state action. It is argued that black student access to higher education will be a hollow achievement unless it is access to a quality education. At virtually every age and educational level, blacks enroll in school or college at lower rates than whites. A more than 8% decline in the college-going rates of black high school graduates from 1976 to 1982 contributed largely to slowing previous growth in enrollment of black college students. Academic preparation is also a significant factor influencing college attendance. The most definitive studies of high school students show a persistent gap  between the academic preparation and performance levels of black and white students. Research has also shown that the types and amounts of financial aid offered to black students play an important role in their enrollment and retention decisions. An important question facing state education leaders is whether current conditions can be changed to increase black college enrollments without abandoning quality improvement. Programs to improve the academic preparation and performance of students through early intervention are a promising approach. (SW)",

        "description":"To explore the potential of computer controlled videodiscs for simulating undergraduate science laboratory instruction, the Annenberg/CPB (Corporation for Public Broadcasting) Project funded the University of Nebraska to create and field test six videodisc laboratory experiments, two each in biology, chemistry, and physics. The six discs were field tested with nearly 700 college students and 45 instructors in seven colleges and universities across the country to yield information on the following topics: the instructional, pedagogical, and production quality of the discs; faculty and student acceptance of this approach; how the simulations compared with traditional science laboratories; and costs of the new technologies compared to traditional approaches. Data were collected  using formal and informal methods--surveys, interviews, observations, and anecdotal reports. Results of the field tests indicate that both faculty and students identified effective features of each disc, particularly self-pacing aspects and opportunities for feedback. Discs were less well received by faculty at research universities than at smaller colleges and universities; however, all faculty agreed that videodiscs are appropriate for teaching experiments that otherwise could not be taught, and for teaching students who otherwise would not have access to science laboratory instruction. In addition to the executive summary, this document also includes the complete evaluation report which provides information and data on: details of the evaluation method, student demographics and  attitudes, acceptability of videodiscs to instructors and students, comparison of videodisc and laboratory experiments, costs, the future potential of videodisc, recommendations, and references. Appendix A provides a critique of each of the six videodiscs and Appendix B provides detailed questionnaire results. (JB)",

Questionnaires were returned by 88 computer coordinators and 51 program directors. Analyses of their responses indicate that both school district coordinators and college program directors  perceive that the competency to evaluate and choose quality software is very important for teachers; the ability to use the computer as an instructional tool in such modes as drill and practice, tutorials, simulations, and problem solving is considered very important by computer coordinators and important by program directors; and the competencies associated with programming and the history of computers are considered moderately important by both groups. The remaining competencies associated with computers and society are considered important by both groups: ethical concerns, record keeping, care of hardware, care of software, word processing, and data processing. The report concludes with a list of 12 competencies to be included in computer education coursework for preservice and  inservice teachers, a 13-item list of objectives and supporting text references and lab activities for a suggested computer literacy course for teachers, 4 tables of survey data, a bibliography for the course, and a list of references.

        "description":"The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), which was developed over the past 25 years through the Research and Development Center at the University of Texas at Austin, identifies seven stages of concern involved in implementing an innovation: awareness, information, personal concerns, management concerns, consequences, collaboration, and refocusing concerns. Hypothetically, an individual's concerns profile would have a wave motion of intensity as the person moves from unawareness and non-use of an innovation into beginning use, and then more highly sophisticated use. The stages of concern about an innovation can be measured by a quick-scoring Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ); the raw scores from SoCQs are converted into percentile scores which can be plotted on a graph per  individual score, as well as producing a group composite score. Based on CBAM assumptions and the findings of other research on innovation implementation, implications of CBAM for library managers and those who facilitate implementation in libraries are: (1) change is a process, not an isolated event, so change requires adequate time to resolve staff concerns, particularly at the lower SoC levels; (2) concerns are natural occurrences with new innovations; (3) concerns occur in sequence and are developmental in nature, making it possible to anticipate predictable patterns of behavior; (4) change begins with individuals; and (5) the stages of concerns about the innovation can be measured by the SoC Questionnaire. The conclusion calls for library change facilitators to examine and consider  this model when implementing new technological programs. A brief bibliography, definitions of the individual stages of concern, and a chart depicting the hypothesized development of the stages of concern are appended. (JB)",

The document begins with a letter from Frank C. Conahan, Director of the U. S. General Accounting Office (GAO) to John O. Marsh, Jr., the Secretary of the Army, which provides a critique of the Army's Extension Training Program, recommends further evaluation before purchase is made of new  videodisc equipment, and introduces the four appendices that make up the major part of the document. Appendix I provides background information on extension training materials; the objectives, scope and methodology of this study; and major findings of the study. Appendix II consists of a letter from the Senior Associate Director of the U.S. General Accounting Office expressing concern over whether the acquisition plans for videodisc equipment are justified based on the low usage of current training materials by soldiers in the field. Appendix III contains a letter from the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in response to the GAO report \"Observations on Army's Plan to Buy an Electronic Video-Disc Delivery System,\" also included in Appendix III. The final appendix consists of  the GAO draft report, \"Improvements Needed in the Army's Program for Developing Extension Training Materials for Use by Soldiers in Field Units,\" which contains five findings and four recommendations and the Department of Defense's reaction to each.

Separate questionnaires organized around four major study questions were designed for teachers, library media specialists, principals, and ITV coordinators, and sent to a stratified sample of 209 schools. The appropriate instruments were completed by 209 principals, 209 library media specialists, and 1,045 classroom teachers, i.e., five teachers in each school. In addition, 24 ITV coordinators for public school systems received an instrument. The results of the survey indicated that: (1) ITV continues to be widely available in all Maryland public schools; (2) the  most serious problem related to availability continues to be scheduling; (3) there is a positive commitment to ITV as indicated by the increase in ITV equipment and facilities during the past three years as well as by plans for increases during the next three years; and (4) the attitudes of teachers and administrators toward ITV is generally positive. Appendices include the survey sample, cover letters to all participants, and addenda to teachers' questionnaires. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"Representing both the public and private sectors, members of an ad hoc committee were charged by the Joint Committee on Printing of the U.S. Congress with evaluating the feasibility and desirability of providing access to federal government information in electronic formats to depository libraries. Appointed in May 1983, the committee was asked to determine: (1) what and how much federal government information is in electronic format; (2) whether depository libraries have the ability to access the new formats; and (3) what the costs and benefits of providing information in electronic format would be. Deliberations were organized around a series of briefings on governmental and private information programs, electronic distribution systems, automated databases, and state-of-the-art  technology. A survey was conducted of all depository libraries (1,382) to determine the current use of electronic hardware and computerized databases as well as their participation in local/regional/national networks providing access to this type of information. Responses were received from 1,291 (93.4%). Chapter I presents the committee's findings under the headings: Availability of Federal Data in Electronic Format; The Depository Library Community; The State of Technology; and Major Issues or Themes in Transfer of Electronic Data to Depository Libraries. Recommendations presented in Chapter II include: the Resolution; proposed pilot projects; criteria for selecting publications; criteria for selecting libraries; monitoring the pilot program; impact on users; and pilot project costs.  Appendices include: a schedule and individual summaries of 23 speakers' presentations; a summary of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) workshop held February 1, 1984; a copy of the questionnaire; a summary of the findings; statistical tables; and glossaries of acronyms and terms.

Using surveys and case studies of public libraries, public school libraries, community college libraries, state institutional libraries, agencies cooperating with libraries in literacy education, and state library agencies, the study examined the extent to which libraries have become involved in literacy education, the types of literacy education services they provide, and the populations they serve. A sample of 900 libraries and agencies stratified by type of library or agency, by state, and by  urban-suburban-rural location was selected. Six data collection instruments (one for each type of library or agency) were developed and administered, and 627 (70%) responses were received. This manuscript contains two volumes. The first volume contains a project overview, a description of the methodology used, the analysis of the survey data pertaining to the involvement of different types of libraries and agencies in literacy education, a composite profile of libraries with exemplary literacy education programs, and recommendations. The second volume contains four appendices: the literature review and bibliography, the case study interview schedules, the survey questionnaires, and site profiles of seven libraries with exemplary literacy education programs.

These indexes are based on annual reports from a sample of all American public libraries serving more than 25,000 people each. Using the 1982 American Library Directory, the researchers identified 1,586 public libraries that appeared to meet this criterion. A letter requesting data on their total circulation and total expenditures for 1975 and 1980 was sent to each of the identified libraries. Usable data was received from 1,336 libraries (84%). The four figures for each library were entered in a computer file and a list was printed of the rates of change for each series--circulation and expenditures--from high to low. Libraries in a systematic  sample (every 50th library) were invited to become members of a new sample for the indexes for the 1980s and to contribute their data for 1981 circulation and expenditures. Based on this sample population, this report is divided into sections on: (1) analyses of the present study procedures; (2) new features of the indexes; (3) tests of accuracy on the U.S. indexes; (4) comparisons of the U.S. indexes with data from England and Canada; and (5) correlations between variables.

        "description":"A broad range of well-structured problems--embracing forms of diagnosis, catalog selection, and skeletal planning--are solved in expert computer systems by the method of heuristic classification. These programs have a characteristic inference structure that systematically relates data to a pre-enumerated set of solutions by abstraction, heuristic association, and refinement. In contrast to previous descriptions of classification reasoning, particularly in psychology, this analysis emphasizes the role of a heuristic in routine problem solving as a non-hierarchical, direct association between concepts. In contrast with other descriptions of expert systems, this analysis specifies the knowledge needed to solve a problem, independent of its representation in a particular computer  language. The heuristic classification problem-solving model provides a useful framework for characterizing kinds of problems, for designing representation tools, and for understanding non-classification (constructive) problem-solving methods. This 12-part report includes the following sections: (1) Introduction; (2) The Heuristic Classification Method Defined; (3) Examples of Heuristic Classification; (4) Understanding Heuristic Classification; (5) Analysis of Problem Types in Terms of Systems; (6) Inference Strategies for Heuristic Classification; (7) Constructive Problem Solving, An Introduction; (8) Relating Tools, Methods, and Tasks; (9) Knowledge-Level Analysis; (10) Related Analyses in Psychology and Artificial Intelligence; (11) Summary of Key Observations; and (12) Implications.

(Only bibliographic databases are covered in this document.) It is recommended that this curriculum be integrated with the teaching of library media skills in other curriculum areas. The librarian and various subject area teachers should jointly establish the goals and objectives for the implementation of the  online curriculum. The first section of this guide, &quot;Online Curriculum,&quot; includes the following subsections: an introduction, offline suggestions, course objectives and student outcomes, planned course scope and sequence, and sample lesson plans. The second section, &quot;Online Management,&quot; includes: an introduction, budget and costs, vendors, gateway software, telecommunications, copyright, security, recordkeeping, and cooperation and support. References, an annotated bibliography and numerous appendices, including a sample search and lists of vendors, telecommunications networks, and commonly used databases, are provided. (THC)",

As of May 1984, most of the objectives of the project had been institutionalized. The bulk of the report consists of appendices which provide observations on LCC's transfer project; profiles of graduates' transfer experiences; a student workbook for a cooperative education internship seminar, covering resume writing, conducting research on careers, the exploratory interview, personal expenses, and career planning; and a sample interview schedule.

This report describes the 1984-85 accomplishments of LCC under the Urban Community College Transfer Opportunities Program (UCCTOP). Following an overview of the project and specific activities, the report describes LCC's efforts to strengthen external linkages with public and private universities and colleges in New York and with secondary schools. The next section describes UCCTOP's student support services, including a two-session transfer workshop, the Transfer Fair, and the Career and Transfer Resource Center. Next, a discussion is presented of LCC's transfer  decision-making curriculum, which includes the cooperative education seminar, &quot;Life, Education and Career Planning.&quot; Following a review of the involvement of LCC's faculty in curriculum reform, the report describes the development of an automated Degree Requirement Checklist that helps students manage progress toward the completion of their degrees. The next section focuses on the development of a research design to document the number, identity, and characteristics of potential transfer students; as well as to monitor student progress through the program and after transfer. Finally, the report discusses the program's budget. Appendices provide a Model for Two-Year and Four-Year Articulation Handbook, an agenda for a transfer workshop, and a list of questions for potential transfer  students to ask college representatives.

        "description":"The decisions that administrators make touch every facet of the institutional experience and fundamentally affect teaching and learning. Research shows, however, that administrators do not always recognize their influence nor their responsibility for the quality of instruction. A study of one urban community college district revealed an unforeseen and unintended impact of administrative decisions in the classrooms, even though only 2% of the Chancellor's Executive Council's decisions over an 18-month period were concerned with instruction or curriculum. Illustrating this point was the Executive Council's decision to emphasize marketing activities. This approach succeeded in recruiting more nontraditional students, but the students' lack of adequate preparation limited their  success in the classroom. To deal with the challenge of providing leadership to achieve the quality of education expected by the public and needed by students, administrators should: (1) emphasize assessment and mandatory placement to allow appropriate standards of performance without increasing attrition; (2) provide high quality advisement for students with degree or transfer objectives; (3) define exit competencies; (4) label transfer courses and restrict enrollment in these classes to students with the commensurate preparation and objectives; and (5) ensure that information sent to secondary schools does not present the community college as compensation for poor high school preparation. One important way for administrators to prepare for this challenge is to renew their knowledge of  student needs, capabilities, and aspirations by periodically returning to the classroom as teachers.

Two questions were examined: (1) What role does the community college system currently play in teacher preparation and continuing education? and (2) What role should the community college system play in the state's effort to deal with the problem of teacher supply and demand? The six consultants employed by the Division of Community Colleges visited all 9 of the state universities, 15 of the community colleges, and 15 of the school districts in the state, deriving observations, findings, and recommendations from the visits. Study findings included the following: (1) community colleges were deeply involved in a full range  of teacher education activities, but there was an almost total absence of systematic planning and coordination at the state and local levels; (2) approximately 49% of the teachers receiving teacher training in Florida's public universities did so after attending a Florida community college; (3) community colleges will remain the primary entry point for Florida's postsecondary students for the foreseeable future; (4) community colleges varied dramatically with respect to their curricula for future teachers; (5) community colleges were underutilized as resources for inservice teacher education; and (6) the consultants identified needs for local determination of appropriate inservice activities, for clarifying recertification rules, and for an increase in resources to provide adequate  support for inservice projects provided by community colleges. The study report includes a chart presenting the consultants' recommendations, along with staff comments, actions recommended for the State Board for Community Colleges, implementation action and date, and follow-up activities.

First-time-in-college students from the fall 1982 term were chosen for the study. Study findings included the following: (1) students who completed college preparatory courses in all areas for which they were underprepared had the same persistence rates as students without skills deficiencies; (2) the  persistence rate for students below the placement score on all three tests ranged from 10% for those who took no college preparatory work to 46% for those who completed work in all three deficiency areas; (3) underprepared students took longer to complete their education; (4) students completing college preparatory courses in the areas in which they had skill deficiencies had a higher CLAST passing rate (81%) than those who did not complete college preparatory classes (56%); and (5) students who successfully completed all necessary college preparatory classes had the same 3-year persistence rates as students who began with no skill deficiencies.

        "description":"A study was conducted by the Center for the Study of Higher Education to provide a systematic analysis of the educational and employment backgrounds, career goals and aspirations, career paths, and concerns of two-year college administrators. A national sample of 2,049 administrators at 1,219 public and private two-year colleges was surveyed. Study findings, based on an overall response rate of 78%, included the following: (1) a substantial majority of the administrators were male in every administrative position considered except one (i.e., head librarian); (2) over 80% of the administrators were white; (3) over 95% of the administrators held bachelor's degrees, 89.6% held master's degrees, and approximately 45% held doctoral degrees; (4) approximately 66% of the administrators  in each group were employed at comprehensive two-year colleges, 25% at vocational-technical colleges, and fewer than 10% at academic institutions; (5) all groups of administrators reported participation in an average of at least 3.5 internal professional activities (e.g., special task forces and in-service staff development); (6) only 10% to 15% of each group reported actively searching for their current positions, and personal contacts were cited as the best sources for finding out about career opportunities; (7) administrators perceived financial support for programs and teaching, high school and junior college articulation, and linkages to business and industry as major future issues; (8) on an average, women administrators were younger (46.8 years) than men (48.8 years); (9) Blacks  and Whites showed no major differences in their patterns of employment; and (10) 74.3% of the Black administrators, 89.3% of the Hispanic administrators, and 56.4% of the White administrators were employed in metropolitan areas. The study report includes conclusions regarding the labor market for two-year college administrators and their career mobility, along with a discussion of the implications of the findings for educational leadership.

        "description":"A study was conducted to analyze the enrollment patterns of high school seniors from the eight public feeder high schools in the MiraCosta Community College (MCC) District. Using the California Community Colleges Student Data System and information obtained from the County Department of Education and each feeder high school, the study examined the following: the numbers of high school students grades 9 to 12 enrolled during the past 5 years, high school dropout and graduation rates, enrollment at MCC from feeder schools, MCC unit load of recent high school graduates, and sources of MCC student enrollment. Study findings included the following: (1) paralleling trends seen nationwide, the number of seniors attending MCC's feeder high schools declined in recent years, hitting a low  point in fall 1983 of 1,627 students, followed by a 3.3% increase in fall 1984; (2) of the 1,664 students who graduated from the feeder high schools in 1984, 205 students enrolled at MCC in Fall 1984; (3) 32.4% of total fall credit enrollment at MCC were new students classified as first-time transfers or first-time transfers from another district; (4) 28.5% of the Class of 1984 were enrolled at MCC on a full-time basis; (5) only 6.3% of first-time students enrolled at MCC in Fall 1984 came directly from the feeder high schools; and (6) the number of 18 and 19 year olds living in the MCC District dropped from 11,472 to 6,064 between 1980 and 1985. Based on study findings, it was concluded that increased recruiting at feeder high schools would not solve MCC's enrollment problem and that  MCC's ability to enroll new students was completely dependent upon populations of students the college could not easily control or predict.

The major purpose of the descriptions is to illustrate the range as well as the commonalities among the elements of training programs in child development and social policy. The descriptions are also intended simply to familiarize the reader with the nature of training in the area. Descriptions follow a general outline which includes a brief account of the program's origin and setting followed by discussions of the program's institutional characteristics, elements of the training program, research activities, and findings of self-evaluations. A concluding commentary focuses on  additional concerns. Providing an overview of the monograph, the introductory essay generally considers models for training in child development and social policy. Four of the programs described are the Bush Centers in Child Development and Social Policy that have been initiated at Yale University and the Universities of Michigan, North Carolina, and California at Los Angeles. Also described are the program in Child Development and Public Policy at Mills College, Oakland, California, the graudate minor in Psychology and Social Policy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Congressional Science Fellowships in Child Development of the Society for Research in Child Development.

Prepared statements testify to the effectiveness of established parent and community volunteer programs and the research studies on types of parent involvement which are most beneficial to students, parents, teachers, and schools. Witnesses include the president of the National School Volunteer Program, a school district coordinator of community relations, a professor of child psychiatry, two researchers on parent involvement, a school director, a school superintendent, a parent, and the president of a research and demonstration  organization. The importance of parent involvement in the education of children is emphasized by all witnesses, and the benefits of parent involvement programs are discussed. An appendix describes at length the establishment and implementation of the School Volunteer Development Project of the Dade County Public Schools. Two tables provide comparative data on: (1) parent and educator views regarding parent involvement roles; and (2) the responses of superintendents, school board presidents, and state education agency officials to questions about the existence of written parent involvement policies.

        "description":"Recent changes in employment practices, family compositions, funding procedures, and attitudes toward child care as a whole have prompted a second child care needs assessment for Jefferson County and the City of Louisville, Kentucky. Three basic methods were used. First, 1980 census data were analyzed to obtain demographic data on child care. Second, providers were surveyed to completely evaluate specific child care slots available. Finally, a survey of over 400 homes with children provided information on child care practices and attitudes. All three methods were used to collect information from seven areas within Jefferson County and in the county as a whole. The census analysis was broken down further into specific localities or neighborhoods. Findings suggest, first, that  infant and toddler care are essential elements in the provision of adequate child care in the community. Second, before and after school care for school-age children are major &quot;needs.&quot; Third, female-headed households are particularly in need of community support systems concerning child care. A fourth outcome of the study was that specific areas of Jefferson County in greatest need of an increase in child care slots were identified. (Author/RH)",

Conducted since 1962, research on the Perry Preschool program constitutes one of the strongest and best-known sources of support for the long-term efficacy of early intervention with disadvantaged children. The Perry Project collected data on 123 3- and 4-year-old disadvantaged black children (with no discernible physical handicaps) during the years of the preschool program, through the early elementary years, at age 15, and at age 19. Analysis of this data shows that the preschool program had a variety of significant positive effects on the children attending. These effects are the basis for comparing the economic benefits of one or two years of preschool.  The report is divided into six sections, each dealing with a category of program effects, including the following: (1) the program and its immediate consequences, (2) elementary and secondary education, (3) higher education, (4) delinquency and crime, (5) welfare, and (6) employment and earnings. Each section discusses the data, assumptions, and methods used to evaluate costs and benefits, as well as the results. A seventh and final section presents an overall view of the benefit-cost analysis in terms of profitability. Finally, the report discusses some of the policy implications of the analysis and some of the issues that must be addressed in making public policy choices based on this evidence. (DST)",

Ways that practitioners can provide high quality and developmentally appropriate services are the focus of Nancy Curry's presentation, while the process by which parents/consumers can be helped to better choose among the options provided is discussed by Richard Endsley and Marilyn Bradbard. Finally, suggestions for ways researchers can best contribute to the field's knowledge about the determinants of good quality early childhood experiences are  presented by Hakim Rashid. In an introductory overview, the main points raised in each of the presentations are briefly summarized; the concluding section synthesizes ideas and recurring themes that can serve as useful guides to the reader.

Based on Chomsky's derivation of a &quot;universal grammar&quot; (the set of essential, formal, and substantive traits of any human language), a number of hypothesized formal universals of clinically-relevant symbolic play were developed. In applying these hypothesized universals to data representing the play activities of a five-year-old boy, a componential analysis (on which the dimensions underlying a set of individual meanings were extracted by pairwise comparisons of these meanings and their contextual attributes) was performed and then interpreted accordingly. It was noted that if different therapists performed a componential analysis on the  raw data and organized the results of this analysis in the manner dictated by the hypothesized universals outlined in this paper, their interpretations would in all probability be both similar across interpreters and relatively valid.

Aspects examined were: (1) characteristics of residential facilities; (2) funding sources for these facilities; (3) types of children served by the facilities and their characteristics; and (4) factors influencing the placement process by which children reach residential care. To conduct the investigation, a method called Program Operations and Delivery of Services Examination (PODSE), which provides a &quot;snapshot&quot; of program operations at one point in time, was used. All residential care facilities providing services to children in the  three states were surveyed by mail; case records on 539 children in residential care across the three states were reviewed. Findings indicated that children with higher levels of previous residential care, Medicaid eligibility, or histories of abuse or criminality tended to have government agencies involved in their placements; children with fewer of these characteristics were more likely to be placed without such involvement. Children whose families had private medical insurance were more likely to be placed without government involvement than were other children. White children were more likely to be placed in privately operated facilities than were nonwhite children, who, more typically, were placed in public facilities. (RH)",

Residential care encompasses the foster care program and includes children placed in foster family homes, small family homes, and group homes. Data were gathered through reviews of records and interviews with knowledgeable officials at the federal, state, and county levels, as well as individuals operating  18 group homes that were reviewed in detail. Additionally, to observe typical living conditions, tours were made of another 48 group homes. Findings indicated that Title IV-E of the Social Security Act was the primary source of federal funds to support group homes. Amounts paid to group homes for each child varied widely, but costs incurred by the homes were allowable under federal and state guidelines. Group homes visited met state safety standards. No evidence was found that the 18 homes reviewed in detail had engaged in duplicate billing of other federal programs. (RH)",

Both content knowledge (i.e., knowledge of classroom rules and norms) and process knowledge (i.e., social problem-solving ability) aspects of the socialization process were explored. Throughout the paper two classroom-socialization domains were considered: adaptation to classroom task and interpersonal demands. Two primary teacher variables were examined: teacher socialization priority (task versus interpersonal focus) and teacher control orientation. Briefly, results indicated that teachers' socialization priorities have an impact on students' understanding of the normative structure of the classroom  environment (content knowledge) and that teachers' control orientation was related to children's ability to socially solve (process knowledge), particularly in the task domain. Different student-level variables were found to predict social problem-solving ability in the task and interpersonal domains. (Author/DST)",

During a first session children were individually pretested for general cognitive level and alphabet and number skills; during a second session they were given individual training on the computer; during third and fourth sessions half of the childen were observed while working alone at a computer and half were observed while working with a peer at a computer; and during a fifth session each child was individually tested for retention and feelings about the computer experience. In general, behavior of paired children was more engaged and more effective than that of nonpaired children, but was not more efficient. In addition, children who worked with a peer were observed  showing more positive affect, rated their affect higher, and retained more about the experience than children who worked alone. Research conclusions also suggested that the advantages of peer interaction increased over the preschool years and that dyadic computer activity is educationally feasible and useful for young children. The results were discussed in terms of a four level-framework of social influence which hypothesized that subjects' skill level relative to task difficulty determines the nature of social influence.

Data are derived from a group of 5,362 children born in England, Wales, and Scotland in March of 1946. The parenting styles have been studied from the time the parents' firstborn children were 4 years old. Tests administered when the children were 8 years old assessed the children's abilities in vocabulary, reading, and sentence completion. Study findings focused on five areas: (1) parents' educational and socioeconomic characteristics in relation to their children's preschool experience; (2) styles of parenting as associated with children's preschool attendance or nonattendance; (3) maternal assessments  of self and child; (4) association of preschool experience and parenting characteristics, styles, and self-assessments with children's verbal attainment scores; and (5) verbal attainment of children who experienced relatively low levels of maternal stimulation. Although preschool experience was an independent and significant predictor of verbal attainment scores, its power was small when compared with mothers' education. In addition, preschool attendance had no significance in predicting the scores of children whose mothers were relatively understimulating. (DST)",

Children's attitudes toward certain animals were measured before and after live exposure to those animals in regular preschool settings. The attitudinal measure was a nonverbal expression of affect as elicited by pictures. Additionally, there was a measure of subjects' awareness of certain information about animal body coverings and other features of anatomy. Results indicated that there were more positive affective reactions to the animals' pictures after live exposure than before and that children's awareness of animal anatomy had increased.

        "description":"Froebelian kindergartens, popular in the United States during the late 1800's, were widely accepted as an effective way to assimilate immigrant children and their parents into the mainstream of the nation's culture. This paper focuses on the immigration patterns that led to an emphasis upon the educational system of Froebel, upon the effectiveness of the kindergarten programs, and upon the importance of nineteenth-century charity kindergartens in determining the development of early childhood education and developmental psychology. It is argued that the long-term results of the charity kindergartens were more favorable for the benefactors than for the recipients, but that the curriculum as it was initiated was humanistic, child-centered, and appropriate within the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of  Victorian America.

Founded on acceptance of the cultural rules and expectations of the tribal community, the project has five major program components: (1) direct service to children; (2) parent, family, and community involvement; (3) interagency cooperation; (4) development of culturally and linguistically appropriate procedures and materials; and (5) staff training and technical assistance. This report for fiscal years 1981-84 includes program philosophy and rationale, numerous measures of the effectiveness of major program components, budget analyses, and a summary of program dissemination activities. Extensive, detailed information is included in pre- and posttesting and  developmental progress of children in the two direct service programs--a preschool for 3-5 year olds and a parent-child program for 1- and 2-year-olds. The child development assessment tools include forms in Spanish and Yaqui. Appendix 1 includes the daily schedule for the preschool, the needs assessment form for parents and families of handicapped children and copies of the record forms for individual children. Appendix 2 contains culturally based curriculum materials that include numerous pictures identified with the Yaqui culture. (JHZ)",

This report builds on an earlier study which identified 298 persistently low-income nonmetro counties during 1950-1970 and uses discriminant analysis to examine what happened to those counties during 1975 and 1979. The 231 counties which retained low-income status had higher rates of work disabilities, larger nonwhite populations, more female-headed families, fewer high school graduates, fewer workers, depended heavily on transfer payments for income, and had a poverty rate much above the nonmetro average.  Twenty-seven counties escaped low-income status during 1975 and 1979 primarily through nonfarm industries such as services, manufacturing, and mining. Despite falling farm incomes 11 counties escaped low-income status in 1979 because they were predominately retirement or college counties or adjacent to urban areas. Tables present demographic and economic characteristics of nonmetro and low-income counties. Appendices containing tables compare southern low-income counties with other southern counties and describe use of discriminate analysis. (LFL)",

The model is designed as both an evaluative tool and learning exercise and moves from a predominance of control team input at the start to one of increasing feedback between the audience and players. The model consists of the following steps: (1) initial design of simulator; (2) initial  scenario development; (3) pilot run for major design flaws and acceptance by other professions in the field; (4) modifications of concept thought to be useful or deleted if unwarranted; (5) redesign scenario using panel of experts; (6) presentation of final package. The model includes five components: control team; player(s); audience; scenario(s); and communication equipment (radios, slides, overheads, hand-outs, etc.).

The report indicates that approximately half the HEP/CAMP participants came from families in the agricultural migrant stream, with over 75% reporting family incomes under $10,000 per year. Only one student in six reported that either parent graduated from high school. Nearly 60% of HEP/CAMP students spoke a language other than English in their homes. Despite the prevalence of &quot;predictors of educational failure,&quot; 84.6% of those enrolled in HEP from 1980-1984 passed the General Educational Development  examination. Of all CAMP students served between 1980-1984, 92.4% have completed at least the first year of college. About 13% have completed two-year degrees, 15% have completed four-year degrees, and nearly 2% have earned graduate degrees. Currently 28% of the HEP population and 68% of the CAMP population are enrolled in school. Over half of these students are employed part-time, one-third are employed full-time, and the rest are unemployed. Without multiple variable analyses, such as those performed for the comprehensive analytical report (Research Report No. 3), career-outcome findings in this report may seem mixed, unclear, and a bit difficult to interpret.

Small schools provide all children--including the gifted--with unique opportunities to develop intellectual, social, and creative capacities. Rural gifted students enjoy: (1) smaller class size with more likelihood of independent work; (2) a school climate of familiarity among teachers, students, principals, and community members; and (3) a school environment where there is greater opportunity for all students to participate in extracurricular activities. To assist rural schools in providing effective programs for gifted and talented students, a catalog was developed of  19 programs selected as having feasible and effective approaches for talented students in rural schools. The programs had the following characteristics: (1) responded to the unique strengths and constraints found in small, rural, and remote schools; (2) focused on the classroom teacher's needs or activities; (3) provided appropriate instructional materials for gifted students; and (4) offered at least one of three program models--acceleration, enrichment, or regular classroom activities.

Along with ebbing support for compensatory education and increased focus on math and science achievement, rural schools can expect a decrease in new hires which will result in a staff of teachers with the greatest seniority--those with the most time elapsed since preservice training--while funds for inservice teacher training will be scarce. In these circumstances rural administrators will need effective staff development activities to improve the awareness, attitudes, and skills of staff members. Studies by the Rural Education Advisory  Committee and the National Rural Project have identified four characteristics of successful rural school staff development programs: (1) focus on topics relevant to rural educators; (2) respond to the varied stages of adult development; (3) provide follow through supervision which enables individual teachers to translate the ideas presented in training to every day rural classroom situations; and (4) plan long-term staff development activities to address the stages of concern about change which the teachers will naturally feel as they attempt to implement instructional changes.

Common themes identified are: the empowerment offered by education to enable rural adults to gain control over their lives; the need for collaboration/cooperation among those serving rural areas; the traditional barriers of isolation, lack of rural self-respect, and resignation with which rural people accept inferior services which block efforts at building effective power bases.  Conference participants shared a variety of models, from programs in entrepreneurship to school-based economic enterprises and from small business development centers to community-wide efforts at economic development. Characteristics shared by successful programs are community support, recognition of and respect for cultural differences, and respect for adult autonomy. The action agenda for extending educational opportunities to rural adults suggests four steps: forming partnerships; disseminating information; influencing community, state, and institutional policy; and establishing a formal organization to link postsecondary educational providers.

        "author":["Schimizzi, Ned V."],
        "description":"Many high school and college students seem to dislike mathematics, do poorly in the subject (as evidenced by declining test scores), and avoid scheduling courses in mathematics. Answers to why test scores are declining and why mathematics achievement is low among adults are speculative and as varied as the educators who offer them. However, one answer may lie in the area of cognitive development. Most of the basic mathematics which students are expected to remember for passing high school and college examinations is taught at a time when they are psychologically incapable of abstract conceptualization. Furthermore, students are taught basic mathematics with methods and strategies which require use of abstract symbols at a stage in their life when they are capable of\"conceptualizing\" only when the concepts are physically structured for them (representations of a mathematical reality constructed in three-dimensional form). Eight areas for curriculum developers to explore or implement in schools (based on knowledge of the psychological development of youth) are offered. They include: excluding concepts and skills from the mathematics programs of 6- and 7-year-olds which they are psychologically incapable of grasping; using real-life mathematical applications; and using Piagetian-oriented teaching methods.

Instruction seldom takes place without instructional materials, so this second digest is a companion one containing a discussion of science education research on instructional materials. Data are shown which support the idea that the science curriculum improvement project materials developed after 1955 were successful in promoting student achievement in the use of science process skills, in creativity, and in higher cognitive skills at both elementary and secondary school levels. Research, however, has focused more on programs than on textbooks. Because teaching from, and with, textbooks is the dominant method of instruction in many  science classes, research is needed on such areas as how students learn to use textbooks to become independent learners and how to write them to promote efficient learning.

The study involved the teaching of a 3-week instructional unit on population genetics and evolutionary processes to advanced placement biology students. The control group (N=38) received the instructional unit alone while the experimental group (N=39) received CAI experiences in addition to the conventional learning activities. The CAI experiences included a computerized simulation of evolutionary trends resulting from natural selection acting upon a population in lieu of the traditional laboratory, as well as an additional tutorial CAI exercise. Both groups were given the same posttest evaluation exercises and the scores  compared with a student's t-test at the .05 level of significance. No significant increase or decrease in test scores was demonstrated at this level. Student evaluations of the CAI lessons presented were very high and indicated considerable interest in continued involvement with CAI. This is consistent with other research findings which indicate that students enjoyed the CAI experience, felt that they had learned from it, and would like to participate in CAI lessons in the future.

        "description":"Factors affecting mathematics enrollment at Broward Community College, South Campus (Florida) were examined. An analysis of demographic data reflects a huge population growth for the South Campus area. Increasing numbers of elderly, young professionals, Hispanics, and other minorities will move here primarily from the northeast and Dade County (Florida). Industrial trends indicate that some small, high-technology industries will move into the South Broward vicinity, although the area will remain primarily residential. However, increased mathematical training will be essential for industrial workers to enable them to keep pace with ever changing technology. Recently enacted state legislation has strengthened both secondary and post-secondary mathematics standards, and mathematics  enrollment on the South Campus is increasing as students attempt to satisfy new state requirements. College data indicates particularly large enrollments in lower-level mathematical courses, probably due to past neglect and avoidance of mathematics. Students at all levels recognize the need for greater mathematics skills; women (who comprise over half the total enrollment and are well represented in mathematics courses) find the South Campus an acceptable place to obtain training. Three recommendations offered are to increase the number of full-time mathematics instructors, expand the mathematics program, and create an adequately staffed mathematics laboratory. (Author/JN)",

The second section describes the specific areas in which beginning teachers report needing additional preparation and the implications for preservice programs generally, as well as for the program at Southern Oregon State College. Their needs include learning to work with other adults (parents, administrators, and aides), learning to work effectively with colleagues, being given a more realistic view of the teaching profession, and  being given a better, more complete theoretical framework from which to work. The third section presents some guidelines for colleges and universities who wish to collaborate with public schools in designing such programs.

It also investigated past, present, and projected international cooperative arrangements for space activities and examines their relationship to competition in space. In keeping with the international focus of this assessment, the report discusses the relationship between space policy and foreign policy. It analyzes domestic policy issues only as they affect the U.S. ability to sell goods and services abroad or to cooperate effectively with other nations. It does not assess policies related to the military and intelligence space programs except  to the extent that they affect international civilian activities in space. The report consists of 10 chapters. Chapter 1 is an executive summary; chapter 2 is an introduction. Topic areas in chapters 3 to 10 are, respectively: international space cooperation; competition; space transportation; satellite communications; remote sensing from space; materials processing in space; space science; and policy alternatives. Each of these chapters includes a table of contents. Five appendices are provided, which include the text of Public Law 98-365 the &quot;Land Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984&quot; and Public Law 98-575 the &quot;Commercial Space Launch Act.&quot; (JN)",

Chapter 2 outlines the history of United States-Soviet cooperation in space, and the policy debates which have taken place in the U.S. since the beginning of the space age. It focuses on lateral intergovernmental U.S.-Soviet space cooperation, as a background to analyzing policy issues facing Congress today and the kinds of questions these may suggest for the future. Chapter 3 (based on a 1984 workshop of space scientists) identifies some potential areas for expanded U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the space sciences. Chapters 4 and 5 combine this historical and scientific background with the complex array of foreign  policy and national security issues which lie at the heart of any U.S.-Soviet cooperative activity in space. Chapter 4 focuses on French policies, since, of all the Western countries, France has had the most extensive and long-term space cooperations with the USSR, and has tended to approach space cooperation with the Soviets in ways quite different from those of the United States. Chapter 5 examines all of these issues as they face U.S. policymakers today. (Supporting documentation, including the text of Public Law 98-562, is included in three appendices.) (JN)",

        "description":"This report responds to a request from the House Committee on Science and Technology and its Subcommittee on Energy Development and Applications to analyze a range of new electric power generating, storage, and load management technologies. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) examined these technologies in terms of their current and expected cost and performance, potential contribution to new generating capacity, and interconnection with the electric utility grid. The study analyzes increased use of these technologies as one of a number of strategies by electric utilities to enhance flexibility in accommodating future uncertainties. The study also addresses the circumstances under which these technologies could play a significant role in the U.S. electric power supply in  the 1990s. Finally, alternative federal policy initiatives for accelerating the commercialization of these technologies are examined. The study does not address the more traditional technologies of central station coal or nuclear, nor does it analyze advanced nuclear or combined-cycle systems and enhancements to pulverized coal plants such as supercritical boilers, limestone, injection, or advanced scrubber systems. In addition, more renewable technologies such as low-head hydropower or refuse- or wood-fired steam plants are not discussed. The new technologies are discussed under two categories: (1) generating (solar technologies, wind turbines, geothermal power, fuel cells, and combustion technologies); and (2) energy storage (compressed air energy storage and advanced batteries).

Data from two studies--\"The National Longitudinal Study of the Class of 1972\" and \"The High School and Beyond Study of the Class of 1980\"--were analyzed. A trichotomous measure of effective participation was used: those persons who engaged in no political activity; those who limited their participation to voting; and those who engaged in political activities other than voting, regardless of whether or not they voted. Results indicated that exposure to social studies courses at the high school level was not related to actual level of political participation seven years after high school. The study showed no differential effects on minority students. Finally, the study showed the pervasive  influence that social class plays in the American political system. Youngsters from high socio- economic status (SES) households had a disproportionately higher chance to be enrolled in an academic program in high school and to be very active in extracurricular events than did students from middle and low SES homes. Political participation was strongly associated with both an academic program and extracurricular participation. (RM)",

In the current movement, excellence, though ambiguously defined and political in nature, denotes a necessary separation among people and in its subtle trappings of class, contains elitist goals for society and school. The expression of these hidden goals required means and indicators that were more politically acceptable. As with excellence, gifted and talented programs and teacher certification programs operate under vague and ambiguous guidelines. Test scores, used as the objectification of quality in gifted and talented programs, provide an insulation for dominant classes who produce and utilize them, and represent a  public myth of fairness and objectivity consistent with Abner Cohen's mystique of elites presented in &quot;The Politics of Elite Culture&quot; (1981). Another manifestation of the excellence movement was the proclamation of current teachers as &quot;non-excellent&quot; and the search for a new set of teacher certification standards. The politics of excellence, using vague and confusing goals and means which convey a mystique, operates to obscure the direction of action being pursued in social and educational policy. Hence, the excellence movement in education appears to persuade the overclasses of their superiority and socially sanctioned ruling position. (LH)",

Research areas in the socio-moral domain commonly focus on a moral dilemma discussion approach, classroom climate and controversial issues in the social studies, community service/social action, and cooperative learning. Four potential interpretations of research focusing on the development of reasoning about political questions and research with a focus on democratic political orientations include: (1) the trivial findings interpretation, which suggests that the influence of social studies programs in the socio-moral domain are trivial and completely without educational or social significance; (2) the resistant variables interpretation, which holds that  because the areas of attitudes and values are among the most resistant to change, any positive influence is detected as significant; (3) the small but socially significant interpretation, which is built around the observation that sometimes small changes found as a result of an interpretation may have important social significance; and (4) the developmental interpretation, which assumes that political reasoning and attitudes are developmental in nature; thus small gains might be interpreted as steps toward more mature and democratic forms of belief and reasoning. A summary of the arguments of a variety of authors suggests the idea that should citizenship education be effective in its goal of producing an entire population of rational/activist citizens, unintended consequences may result  that actually conflict with basic democratic values.

Many aspiring entrepreneurs lack the characteristics and background they need to survive and instead display several common characteristics which predispose them to failure, such as being non-aggressive and casual, failing to develop an action plan or seek professional advice, and lacking sufficient managerial experience. Moreover, they often do not realize the number of uncontrollable factors working against the success of a new business. These negatives are presented as a six-point argument, following which readers are invited to make tape-recorded rebuttals to each point, then wait a week, then play back the tape as detached observers while mentally asking a  set of objective questions about the person on the tape as a potential business owner. The person who can answer all these questions positively might be among the three percent of new business owners who succeed. (LP)",

        "description":"A policy decision taken at Michigan State's College of Education profoundly changed the nature and orientation of the elementary social studies methods courses taught. It was decided that the college would move from a relatively monolithic program to offering incoming students a choice of alternate programmatic routes to certification. Specifically, within a two-year span of time four different programs were offered as alternatives to the traditional program. The thematic alternative programs were entitled: (1) \"Learning Community\"; (2) \"Academic Learning\"; (3) \"Multiple Perspectives\"; and (4) \"Teaching in Heterogeneous Classrooms.\" All of the new programs retained an elementary social studies methods course within their curricular design. This paper examines the issues raised  when a social studies methods course must be reconciled in premise and practice with a thematic teacher training program which is designed to be longitudinally consistent. Under special consideration are the unique premise, content, and organizational dimensions of the \"Learning Community\" and \"Multiple Perspectives\" teacher training programs. Descriptions are presented of the content and design of these two programs, the course of which key questions about these teacher training alternatives are discussed. (JD)",

About half of the teachers surveyed believed that the program will improve the quality of instruction in Tennessee public schools. However, most teachers did not think that the program will necessarily attract more qualified individuals into the teaching profession nor serve as an incentive for educators to remain in the field. About 85 percent of the teachers felt that the program will cause morale problems  because of the pay differentials, but 40 percent stated that they had become better teachers because of the career ladder program. While most respondents felt that prospective teachers should be required to pass a competency examination, most did not believe that those presently teaching should be required periodically to pass a test measuring their knowledge and skills in their content area. Most teachers did not report that fair evaluations were likely to occur in their school system. (CB)",

An overview of the framework of Fuller's theory examines the salient points in the progression of concerns from non-concern, through self-concern, to the mature concern of the impact of teaching upon students. It is pointed out that these stages of concern are not necessarily sequential in each individual, and that students enter teacher preparation programs with varying degrees of maturity. Following a summarization of the Fuller perspective on the Concerns Model and a description of some of the implications of the model for teacher education practices, a discussion  is presented of processing research issues regarding teacher concerns. It is suggested that, in terms of future research agenda, much more needs to be understood in terms of the dynamics of concerns as they relate to the change process in preservice teacher education programs.

Drawing on philosophical analyses and studies of elementary and secondary schools, teacher preparation, staff development, and the adoption of innovations, it argues that personal orientations (centering on personal habits, interests, and opinions) remove teacher decisions from the realm of criteria for judging appropriateness. Personal reasons have explanatory value; they carry less weight when justifying professional action. Role orientation involves references to larger, organized contexts, including the disciplines of knowledge, group purposes, and societal issues. Attention to the  teaching role is particularly important in American education where structural features (e.g., recruitment, induction, rewards) and the ethos of the profession converge in presentism, conservatism, and individualism. These tendencies are reinforced by typical workplace conditions. Teacher isolation and the lack of shared experiences and a common language make it difficult to develop role orientation. Practices in teacher preparation and staff development stressing the personal, even idiosyncratic, element in teaching are therefore problematic and ought to be abandoned. Instead, teacher educators should attempt to develop and support role orientation as a disposition. A 47-item reference list is appended. (Author/LR)",

In phase one, a two round modified Delphi approach was used to bring a panel of outstanding Connecticut educators to consensus as to which competencies were important measures of teaching effectiveness. In phase two, a state-wide survey of a random sample of 2743 Connecticut teachers and administrators was conducted to determine whether they perceived the competencies identified by the Delphi panel as important measures of teaching effectiveness. As a result of this study, 85 generic teaching competencies were identified which teachers and administrators agreed were important, were not grade  specific, and were not subject matter specific. Also, teachers and administrators agreed that the behaviors described by 45 of the 85 competencies were directly observable by an evaluator. Finally, the construct validity of these competencies was supported through factor analysis, assuring that there is a link betwen Connecticut teaching competencies and the literature on teacher effectiveness.

While elements that hold the department together may vary in strength from department to department and school to school, the core of common interests needed to establish and maintain teamwork and group  cohesion are there. The department group, if properly nutured, can be a powerful force for achieving excellence. This paper proposes a view of the department that positions it as a new force for increasing the effectiveness of high schools. A means of attaining this goal, based on the principles of goal-based management, is presented along with specific applications which illustrate the principles in action. Issues that affect department performance are also examined. (JD)",

Data for the study were obtained from classrooms in four school districts which implemented the ALEM as the core instructional program in grades K through 3, in conjunction with participation in the National Follow Through Program. Sites varied in ethnocultural, socioeconomic, and geographic characteristics. Teachers' classroom  implementation was measured by administration of the Implementation Assessment Battery for Adaptive Instruction (IABAI). Results, obtained using analyses of variance, item analysis, and correlational analysis, were summarized to show few marked differences in patterns of change over time for the three types of teaching skills. When ample support was provided, improvements in implementation were likely to result; the absence of or inadequacy of support, however, lead to stagnation or decrement of teaching skills. (LMO)",

The two questions addressed in this study were: (1) To what extent does the use of essential descriptors affect the overall &quot;pass-fail rate&quot; for each competency? and (2) To what extent does the use of essential descriptors affect the dependability of the certification decision? Data was used from twenty-six teachers who volunteered to prepare a lesson plan portfolio and who allowed observers to come into their classes. Results of observations were scored using two different methods: (1) using essential  descriptors according to the criteria anticipated when the instruments are used in certification; and (2) treating descriptors equally, with no essential designation. Analyses were conducted on the transformed data obtained using the essential and non-essential scoring systems. Results showed that the essential descriptors did not detract from the reliability of the measures; in fact, it was enhanced by them. Although the study requires replication with a larger number of teachers and more realistic conditions, the results were viewed as supportive of the essential descriptor scoring method. (LMO)",

Benjamin Payton keynoted the conference by describing a major task of American education as providing individuals with mobility, equity, and opportunities for a better economic life. M. Susana Navarro spoke about the effects that new state standards for quality in education have had on the access of minority students to higher education. James Blackwell offered 12 suggestions aimed at increasing access and reducing the attrition rate of minority students in college and professional schools. Constance Clayton described a number of successful Black and Hispanic high schools. Bernard Gifford suggested that teacher testing might serve as a form of recognition for educators who wish to demonstrate special proficiency in  their profession. Raphael Cortada pointed out the specific problems that community colleges now face in an age of change without growth. Tomas Arciniega and Steven Arvizu made specific suggestions that colleges can implement in order to improve quality and equality on their campuses. Frank Newman closed with a historical as well as a future look at American education. (PN)",

All third, sixth, eighth, and twelfth grade students in California public schools were tested in reading, written language, and mathematics. The highlight of the 1983-84 expansion of CAP was the implementation of a first-time test in grade eight: the Survey of Academic Skills Grade 8. Results of the new test are included in each of the content areas of this report. A pilot study was conducted in the spring of 1984 to develop a statewide direct writing assessment. The report's findings included the following: (1) California third graders are slightly below the national average in reading and written language and slightly above  in mathematics; (2) sixth graders are right at the national average in reading and written language and substantially above it in mathematics; (3) twelfth graders are below the national averages in written language, reading, and mathematics. Chapters III through V include detailed reports of the areas of reading, written expression, and mathematics, as well as conclusions and recommendations of the statewide advisory committee. Supplementary information is given about students' habits concerning homework, reading, and television watching. Chapters VI and VII assess the future of science, and history-social science expansion of the grade eight test. Chapter VIII describes results of a variety of equating studies that compared California students with a variety of national and international  samples of students at each grade level. The appendix lists members of assessment advisory committees. (LMO)",

        "description":"The theoretical framework and cross-cultural validation of Tell-Me-A-Story (TEMAS), a projective test developed to measure personality development in ethnic minority children, is presented. The TEMAS test consists of 23 chromatic pictures which incorporate the following characteristics: (1) representation of antithetical concepts which the examinee must resolve in telling a story about the pictures; (2) structure and reduced ambiguity in order to pull specific, underlying personality functions; and (3) ethnic and contemporary stimuli to elicit diagnostically significant stories. The TEMAS test has been standardized with Hispanic children (grades K-6) in New York and Puerto Rico, and is in the process of being standardized with Black and White children in the United States.  Preliminary studies of the New York population indicated that Hispanic and Black children were more verbally fluent on the TEMAS than the Thematic Apperception Test, and that TEMAS pictures evoked stable themes over a four-month interval. Other studies established internal consistency and interclinician reliability in rating TEMAS protocols. Evidence of concurrent validity was established, as well as the utility of TEMAS in predicting therapeutic outcomes in a therapy project. Discriminant validity was based on TEMAS profiles, which discriminated significantly between clinical and nonclinical samples of Hispanic and Black children. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"This study reports two experiments which indicate that the processes of providing subjects with insightful representations of example programs and guiding subjects through an &quot;ideal&quot; problem solving strategy facilitate learning. A production system model (GRAPES) has been developed that simulates problem-solving and learning in the domain of writing recursive functions. In the first experiment, a mental model of recursion that employed the given representation (structure model) was contrasted with a model of recursion that emphasized how recursive functions are evaluated (evaluation model). Two groups of subjects were tested using these models, and, in the training phase, both groups reached the same level of proficiency. However, data suggest that the structure model group  reached this level in a more efficient manner, having learned a general strategy for structuring their code very early on in the training phase. In the second experiment, members of the GRAPES research group implemented and tested a computer-based system for tutoring LISP. Students of a LISP programming course were divided into two groups, one that interacted with the LISP tutor and another that worked in a standard LISP environment. Overall performance for students interacting with the LISP tutor was superior to those who did not interact with the tutor. (Author/LMO)",

The Army, which uses simulator devices for performance based weapons training, has used a process linked to the Life Cycle System Management Model to design, develop, and evaluate training devices. Review of the problems associated with previously used techniques led to the development of a new model which uses both decision analysis and mathematical modeling. These issues included: (1) the appropriateness of transfer of training as a criteria for measuring device effectiveness; (2) other measures such as skill acquisition and efficiency and transfer efficiency; (3) other variables  influencing device effectiveness; (4) the data to be collected; (5) the Life Cycle System Management Model; and (6) the validation of forecasts. Findings indicated that device evaluation could be viewed within the more general context of program evaluation, in which hypotheses relate program inputs and activities to logically linked outcomes. This forecasting method was recommended for the device acquisition process when opportunities to conduct research and evaluation activities are limited. (GDC)",

The analytic procedures included Monte Carlo simulations to assess the interpretation of DEFT data output; sensitivity of DEFT parameters; comparison of outputs; stability; and interrater agreement. Results indicated that it would be necessary to include assumptions regarding expected distributions of input variables in order to meaningfully interpret DEFT output. Also, the Monte Carlo analyses demonstrated the sensitivity of output scores to  variations in inputs, and assessed the effects of various assumptions regarding measurement error on output scores. Interrater reliability was high for all three DEFT levels on ratings of three actual training devices, using several different raters. (GDC)",

It analysed up-to-date user manuals and technical supplements of 27 well known and widely used aptitude and achievement tests. Study procedure involved four basic steps: (1) selecting tests; (2) contacting publishers for current and complete technical information; (3) analyzing the technical data; and (4) determining interrater agreement. A matrix was constructed to include the tests and six psychometric characteristics, yielding 162 cells. Each cell was filled in or left blank, according to the information pertaining to the inclusion of the handicapped. Sixty-three cells were blank;  84 contained question marks, indicating widespread failure among test developers to clarify the population on which they developed instruments. Results indicated most test developers and publishers provide scant data on the appropriateness of their tests for use with handicapped children. Appendices include a four-page bibliography, a table showing the titles, authors, publishers and copyright dates of the norm-referenced tests, and a table showing handicapped children's participation in the development of the tests.

A committee of lay citizens and professional educators identified basic competencies in reading, mathematics, and language to be mastered by Alabama students being granted a diploma. Another group constructed test items measuring these competencies. Before being assembled into booklet form, the trial items were reviewed by a number of professionals, including persons in special education. The items were critiqued by a specialist in visual impairments, a specialist in hearing impairments, a generalist who supervised a program of  comprehensive special education services, and by a full-time staff person in special education at the State Department of Education. The Special Education Task Force for Basic Competency Education determined what special accommodations should be made in the testing program for the handicapped. The final report of this task force, Basic Competency Education Regulations and Accommodations for Exceptional Students, was adapted and disseminated to all local school systems. The regulations are included in the paper, as is the list of competencies. (LMO)",

It was expected that each of the three creativity scores would predict interest in the creative arts. Scores on the creative performance measure significantly predicted interest in the creative arts, as expected. Scores on the creative personality inventory (the Group Inventory for Finding Creative Talent) predicted interest not only in the creative arts, but also in business contact and business detail. Scores on the divergent-thinking test (Pattern and Line Meanings)  significantly predicted interest only in business contact. It was tentatively concluded that the creative performance measure is (1) more accurate than the divergent-thinking tests for predicting interest in the creative arts; and (2) more specific for this purpose than the creative personality inventory.

The other purpose of this report is to summarize the course of development of the handbook so that users and training developers may better understand the Army needs that prompted the handbook development and the research on which it is based. The report begins with a discussion of the background research into the thinking processes of intelligence analysis and of the resulting descriptive cognitive model of analysis. It then briefly describes  the training products that were developed based on the research findings, including the handbook. Finally, the handbook itself is provided in an appendix which is 90% of the document.

        "description":"This monograph reports on an exploratory investigation of the impact of minimum competency testing on local schools. The implementation and impacts of test requirements in three Missouri and four Ohio local school districts are studied through interviews with teachers and administrators and through the analysis of written materials on the test and curricula. The focus is on how the testing programs affected the curriculum, teaching, the allocation of resources, the relationships between school and community, and how teachers responded to the program. Both the intended and unintended consequences are examined. The findings suggest minimum competency tests affect different schools in varying ways. Test programs can be formulated and implemented in ways that create anxieties and  resentments among teachers, or in ways that gain their support. Even the administration of a common state test will affect different schools differently. Several general factors determine the impact, including the following: (1) the form and objectives of the test; (2) the level of local community interest in student test performances; and (3) the expectations of school leaders with respect to student performances. The public interdistrict comparisons of test results greatly affected the impact of the Missouri test mandate. (Author/LMO)",

        "description":"Recent test results reveal that the test score decline has ended, but the legacy of this highly publicized educational episode continues. One widespread interpretation of the decline and recovery is that permissiveness and a collapse of standards in the late 1960s led to the decline and that a return to the basics and to tougher standards caused the turnaround. This paper argues that the causes of test score decline are still uncertain; that schools' standards and programs in the late 1960s probably had less to do with test score decline than is commonly believed; and that although the recent turnaround in test scores may have been the result of schools' renewed emphasis on the skills included on standardized tests, there are risks in teaching to test, in advocating a return to&quot;the basics,&quot; and in believing that the central instructional problems of schools today will be remedied by rehabilitating the nation's average scores on standardized tests.

        "description":"In general, people seem to be poor at noticing analogies, especially when they are required to apply an analogy to a domain that is new. It was suspected that schemas influence the noticing and applying of analogies. Schemas are hypothesized to be abstract propositional structures that emphasize relationships among categories of objects rather than specific objects and their actions. Two experiments were conducted to manipulate the likelihood of schema formation and to assess the effects of schemas on analogical problem solving. Schemas were hypothesized to be abstract propositional structures that emphasize relationships among categories of objects rather than specific objects and their actions. In experiment I, instructions and the number of stories were manipulated to form a  2x2 design. The performance of two-analog comparison versus two-analog no-comparison groups suggested that a schema may aid in the noticing of analogies, but not in the application of an analogy. Experiment II was designed to investigate additional processing done by \"comparison\" subjects in the original experiment. All subjects in the second experiment read two analogs and wrote summaries of them, and compared or did not compare the stories. Within four resulting groups, subjects were either given the target problem or were asked to report back one week later. There was no difference in performance between the delay and no delay groups in solution rates. Results of both experiments suggested that schemas are most helpful, at least for novices, in applying analogies as opposed to the  initial noticing of analogies. Analogs and problems used are appended. (LMO)",

        "description":"The stability of intelligence test scores over time was examined for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). Subjects included 64 children aged 6-16, who had been administered the WISC-R during prior evaluations. These students had been referred because of academic difficulties. One-third of the sample had taken the test twice, one-third three times, and one-third four times. Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), performance IQ, and full scale IQ scores were available. Correlations and t values values were computed between the first and second, second and third, and third and fourth WISC-R administrations. Results indicated test stability coefficients ranged from .71 to .93 for verbal IQ, from .76 to .88 for performance IQ, and from .69 to .93 for full scale  IQ. For the 22 students who had four testing experiences, mean scores were below average each time. Scores generally decreased slightly in subsequent test administrations. An analysis using Pearson correlations showed the following statistically significant correlations between test trials: verbal, .71 to .93; performance, .69 to .88; and full IQ, .66 to .93. It was concluded that the WISC-R is a reliable test, over time, when used with school-age children experiencing learning difficulties. (GDC)",

Panels of experts from teacher education institutions and local school districts performed the test item review, focusing on test validity and minimum requirements for admission to teacher education programs. Participants (136 teacher educators, 108 high school teachers and curriculum specialists, and 15 professional educators) were sent preview information before participating in the review. The teacher educator panel reviewed every test item; (1) for its relevance to successful performance in their institution's teacher preparation program, and (2) to determine whether or not a student should be required to correctly answer the item in order to be admitted to a teacher education program. Judgments  were also made on the amount of a test section's content a student must know for successful school performance and for admission. Two public educator panels reviewed every test item using two questions: (1) whether education students had the opportunity to learn this content; and (2) whether this knowledge was necessary for successful teaching performance. The PPST includes both multiple choice items (reading, mathematics, writing, and essay items). (Data analyses and scoring techniques are briefly described). (GDC)",

This study, involving 479 graduate and undergraduate students, examines the question of whether importance and agreement measures have different underlying dimensions, and examines the question of whether the addition of an importance measure to an agreement measure will change these dimensions. The instrument used for this study was a university environment attitude survey, including 25 statements describing characteristics of atmosphere. Subjects were grouped into three randomly equivalent groups of 160 each. A factor analytic procedure was conducted for each of the three groups. Findings indicate that importance and agreement measures  have similar underlying dimensions, and that the addition of an unimportance measure to an agreement measure will not change these dimensions.

The Zones of Indifference Instrument (ZII) was used to measure the degree of acceptance of authority. The Purdue Teacher Opinionnaire (PTO) was also administered to the group of Mississippi teachers to measure their morale. Usable responses were obtained from 159 teachers. The two factors of the ZII, teacher determined practice and administrator determined policy, as well as total ZII score, were significantly correlated with three PTO factors: teacher rapport with principal, teacher salary, and teacher status. The PTO factor, curriculum issues, also correlated significantly with administrator determined policy. Teacher rapport with principal and teacher load accounted for  considerable variance in teachers' attitudes toward the acceptance of authority. When the data from both tests were compared, low scores on the following factors were associated with a narrow zone of indifference and high rejection of the principals' authority: teacher-administrator rapport, teacher salary, teacher status, and curriculum issues. It was concluded that there was support for the concurrent validity of the Zones of Indifference Instrument. (GDC)",

Aims of the study were: (1) to provide a conceptualization of the domain of writing; (2) to explore and describe various aspects of teaching written composition; (3) to describe how students in different countries respond to assignments; and (4) to test hypotheses about factors assumed to affect performance in written composition. A model was developed for the study which included three populations (representing  three levels of schooling) and a series of instruments to be used. Research was organized around: (1) sampling of participant schools; (2) describing replacement strategy and procedure; and (3) describing the procedure for selecting classes. The remainder of the research addressed aspects of the sampling plan and procedure which were unique to the three individual populations of the model. Results of preliminary data analysis are presented in tables. A supporting document, Task 1 Training and Scoring Materials, is provided in an appendix. (LMO)",

Examples of specific questions to ask of the database are given. The Management of Instructional Information Systems project at the Center for the Study of Evaluation (University of California at Los  Angeles) describes the question-asking approach which means delineating those questions that are in need of answers. The taxonomy of questions is presented as it might be used by various members of the school community to develop information about students, classes, grades, special groups, or schools.

(3) Significant financial disparities between the state's school districts restrict educational opportunities, and recent legislation has overturned earlier measures addressing this problem. (4) Minnesota students have changed: perhaps the most important challenge to public education is  coping with a student population whose circumstances of life are dramatically different from their parents and older siblings.

        "description":"Data which demonstrate increasing poverty in the United States are collected in this report. Following a brief introduction, six sections present information to support these major findings: (1) Today there is a growing trend toward income disparity between rich and poor. Americans of moderate incomes as well as those classified as poor have lost ground, while wealthy Americans have surged ahead. (2) Poverty is more extensive today than it has been for quite some time: the poverty rates for each of the past three years have been well above the poverty rates of the 1970s and higher than those for any year since the mid-1960s. (3) The belief that the poor are a distinct group who live in poverty much of their lives is false. In fact, large numbers of Americans are poor, or can  expect to be poor, at some time in their lives. (4) Major reductions in Federal domestic programs since 1980 have disproportionately affected those with low or moderate incomes and have contributed to the rise in poverty. (5) The 1980s budget cuts were made in programs that were already inadequate. Federal benefit programs have large gaps, fail to reach millions who are poor, and provide benefit levels that, in most cases, fall well below the poverty line. (6) In a time of support program reductions, those with low and moderate incomes have had to face the additional burden of rapidly rising costs for basic necessities as well as higher taxes. An appendix contains a discussion of the ongoing debate over whether food stamps and other non-cash benefits should be included in the poverty  count. (KH)",

        "description":"This report presents ethnographic case studies of the life circumstances and experiences of 18 low-income adolescents who participated in Project Redirection, a national program which provides educational and family planning services at the local level to pregnant teens and mothers. Information on the teens' family background, patterns of sexuality and birth control use, and educational and employment aspirations for the future is provided, and the impact of their participation in the project is assessed. The report recommends that the program make a greater effort to involve itself with the participant's family and the father of the baby. Given the study's finding that the mother is usually the primary support for the teen and the quality of the mother-daughter relationship is a  primary influence on the teen's decision making, a major program objective should be to lessen conflict and strengthen these bonds. In addition to helping the teens reach stated goals (such as continued schooling), program staff and community women are encouraged to help teens learn appropriate habits and behaviors. A broad range of educational techniques is needed to increase teens' knowledge of birth control practices, and on-site program workshops must do more than simply provide teens with the opportunity to socialize with others in their situation. Appendices to the report discuss methodology and provide synopses of the 18 case studies. (KH)",

The sample group consisted of 177 (57 men, 120 women) black school counselors and 36 (5 men, 31 women) psychologists in seven predominantly black, urban public schools. The information gathered covered the following areas: (1) demographics of black counselors and school psychologists; (2) tasks performed and techniques employed by the professionals; (3) theoretical orientations of the two groups; and (4) problem areas for the practitioners and students. It was found that the black school practitioners were quite similar to other school counselors in terms of tasks performed and techniques used. Further, black counselors and psychologists are equally divided in their  beliefs regarding strategies for working with Black Students and whether these should be different from those employed with other students. The process by which an individual counselor or psychologist has entered his or her career may influence their theoretical and ideological orientations and approaches. Support and resources are needed to allow the practitioners additional time to spend with students. Finally, it was found that the perceptions of others affected the functioning of the school mental health practitioners in all measured areas.

The sample was 142 black males, ages 18 and over, living in the Washington, D.C. area. A personal interview schedule, consisting of closed and open-ended questions, was administered and data was collected and analyzed by computation of frequency distributions and analyses of selected variables using correlational statistics and principal component factor analysis. In general, the respondents were found to be in good mental and physical health, although approximately  one-fourth reported having a chronic health problem such as diabetes or hypertension. The problems most frequently mentioned by the respondents were economic or employment problems. Concerning help-seeking patterns, most of the men preferred solving their own problems and the factors influencing whether they sought outside help or not related largely to the type of problem rather than to personal characteristics. Relatives and friends were found to be important sources of help, and mothers, wives, and girlfriends were most frequently mentioned as helpers. The group was found to use formal sources of help infrequently; however, their attitude toward such help was positive. (CG)",

The first chapter summarizes the youth employment problem and draws conclusions and makes recommendations based upon the data in the report. The next chapter draws a detailed picture of the youth unemployment problem, showing the widening gap between black and other youth in finding and keeping jobs, as well as the increasing problems for Hispanics and children from low income families. Chapter 3 describes the implementation of YEDPA and shows how the legislative mandates, time schedules, and program and policy environment in which it operated determined the course of its programs and created constraints on its operation. Chapter 4 outlines the procedures  used in evaluating the effectiveness of the programs. Chapters 5-8 report on the effectiveness of the occupational skills training, labor market preparation, temporary jobs, and job placement programs. Chapter 9 summarizes the research on program effectiveness derived from large, representative national samples, using national data bases.

This is followed by analyses of recent reports which have influenced policy, and the paper concludes with identification of research needs in the light of recent research done in the United States. The first section deals with changes in the degree of differentiation in Australian society; changes in modes of analysis of educational and sociological research; changes in definitions of equality of opportunity; and actual programmatic changes in the education of immigrants. The second section reports on the structure of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs (AIMA) and its 1980 report, which  includes recommendations for tertiary education, upgrading adult education, and financial grants for ethnic schools. The document also presents highlights from AIMA's evaluation of post-arrival programs and services in 1982, and an analysis of the research report commissioned by the Schools Commission concerning ethnic schools. The final section considers future research needs and finds that the measures recommended in the foregoing reports are relatively weak on the whole. (CG)",

Currently, it is argued, a gap exists between comparative educational study and the theory and practice of education. This leads to three areas of need. First, professional comparativists need to demonstrate the kinds of comparisons they can make and their relevance to educational theory and practice. Second, researchers and practitioners need to develop a common language for interpretation of the studies of comparativists and to provide knowledge that can apply to real situations in schools. Third, practitioners need to indicate the nature and context of their practical concerns so that the relevance of comparative  studies can be determined. The demand in the 1970s for multicultural education in Australia, and the use to which comparative studies were put in furthering this demand, provide a starting point to offer suggestions on improving the dialogue between researchers and practitioners.

Particular references are made to recent changes in the age structure of Australia and New Zealand.

Policies and provisions in practice throughout the world are discussed next, including: legislatively supported education programs for the elderly; the elder hostel system in United States universities; the  European &quot;universities du troisieme age&quot; (universities of the third age); the United Kingdom's Forum for the Rights of the Elderly Persons to Education; Chinese organizations which support lifelong learning; and the Wider Horizons program of New Zealand.

The whole educational process tends to be aimed at the university entrance examination, and this emphasis imposes formidable psychological pressure on young adolescents. Preoccupied with preparation for the upper schools, Japanese educators seem to have forgotton the task of achieving the full development of individuals. This situation results, in part, from the severe competition for admission to Japan's higher-ranking universities. Regardless of family background and birthplace, a student is almost guaranteed a better life if he or she gains admission to a more selective school. Recent reform efforts, such as the 1979 University Entrance Reform, offered merely incremental changes. Once  accepted at the University, however, a student's life is relatively undemanding; the function of the universities is social selection, not education. Although 76.8% of university students attend private institutions, most of Japan's private universities are poorly funded. Thus, most students study under poor conditions and pay more for less education. Finally, Japanese universities are isolated at the inter-department, inter-university, and international levels. In hiring staff, preferential treatment is always given to school alumni, and departments tend to be mutually exclusive. Moreover, the number of foreign teachers and students at Japanese universities is significantly small. (KH)",

In 1954, Nigeria was given a new constitution which divided the country into regions, each of which was responsible for education in its own area. School inspection was managed on a regional basis, with a mixed record of idealism, efficiency, and ineffectiveness. The next section considers school inspection after the splitting of Nigeria into many small states in 1967. One of the major problems inspectors faced was inappropriate, outdated, or non-existent education law. To date the country's education law has still not been made uniform or centralized. Next, patterns of educational administration are discussed. The country's  two basic forms of school administration are identified with the two sources of the Nigerian educational system, and differ in the degree to which control is held by state or local officials. Finally, the role of the Federal Ministry of Education and the Federal Inspectorate is described. Federal and State inspectors have different roles, with Federal inspectors less involved in administration and more involved in classroom evaluation. Relations between the two levels have generally been good. (CG)",

        "description":"The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) for fiscal year 1984 provided services to 3 million persons who met income criteria and were judged to be at nutritional risk. Because WIC has to operate within congressional funding levels--$1.36 billion in 1984--only about 1/3 of those eligible can be served. In this report, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) found that improved program management is needed to derive maximum effectiveness and benefits from each dollar spent on WIC. Specifically, local WIC agencies must be made aware of the need to target program benefits to those in the most vulnerable groups, generally considered to be pregnant and breast-feeding women and their infants. GAO recommends that targeting be established as a major  program objective, monitoring of state and local agency performance be initiated, and state and local agencies be encouraged to use more outreach and publicity and develop closer ties with medical sources that will refer the most vulnerable individuals to WIC. Optimal use of WIC resources can be fostered by imposing greater rigor and uniformity in establishing and using nutritional risk factors and related standards, strengthening income determination processes, and changing the way WIC funds are allocated to, and managed by, state and local agencies.

These programs spent more than $400 billion in Federal tax dollars in fiscal year 1983, excluding administrative costs, or about 49% of the United States budget. Estimates for these programs for fiscal year 1986 are nearly $450 billion. The document identifies 150 programs, and for 91 selected programs, it (1) provides financial and other related data; (2) describes their purposes, who is eligible for them, and the benefits available; and (3) identifies the Federal agencies that administer them and the congressional committees that oversee them.  These programs come under the income security function of the Federal government. They help meet the needs of people by insuring against loss of income resulting from retirement, disability, death, or unemployment of a wage earner, and by assisting the truly needy who are unable to provide for themselves.

        "description":"The workers' cooperative movement has grown in many countries of Europe, where it is often state-sanctioned and supported. In Australia, however, the movement is just beginning. The government organization of what are called cooperative development programs is the dominant new feature on the Australian worker cooperative scene. However, funding is only marginal. Cooperative development programs are not worker cooperatives either, and their origins in Australia from state government initiatives are a long way from the origins at grassroots level that idealists concerning worker cooperation would possibly have preferred. Nevertheless, the programs are facilitators for worker cooperatives. The structure of Australian cooperatives and related development programs varies by state.  Cooperative movements place great importance on education. In Australia, this principle needs to be pursued vigorously if cooperation is to become established successfully. Since the cooperatives now operating in Australia are too small to operate their own educational systems, they must rely on systems already in place, such as TAFE (Technical and Further Education). The responses of TAFE to the educational needs of worker cooperatives in Australia have varied considerably state by state. Until the cooperative movement has developed its own formal education system, more formal connections among the movement and TAFE and other education systems will be needed. TAFE has a role to play in the success of the workers' cooperatives. A four-page bibliography is included. (KC)",

        "description":"Universities and colleges of advanced education in Austrialia were surveyed to determine their policies and practices in admitting and granting status to holders of TAFE (Technical and Further Education) middle-level certificates who wish to transfer to relevant higher education courses. Of the 90 higher education institutions that were approached, 35 responded. It was found that the majority of higher education institutions in Australia, including a number of universities, was prepared to admit students to courses on the basis of a successfully completed relevant TAFE middle-level course and that during the years 1980-1983, more than 15,000 students had availed themselves of that opportunity. It was also found that many higher education institutions are prepared to grant status  to holders of TAFE middle-level certificates, but that the number of students who are actually granted status is quite small. No conclusions could be drawn from the information obtained in this study on the success of students with TAFE middle-level certificate backgrounds who have been admitted either with or without status to courses in higher education compared with students admitted in the traditional way, but, from the limited information available, such students seem to be reasonably successful. Recommendations were directed principally at obtaining more information on the performance in higher education of holders of TAFE middle-level certificates so that the current policies of the institutions might be liberalized further, and at ensuring that information concerning opportunities  available to holders of TAFE middle-level certificates is readily available.

Selections for two types of courses are considered in the paper: (1) pre-apprenticeship courses that focus on a particular trade area and usually lead to credit in only one apprenticeship course; and (2) prevocational courses that introduce the student to a number of trade areas and lead to credit in several apprenticeships. The paper is organized in five chapters. Chapter 1 discusses issues in selection, including rationale, selection for particular courses, and other issues. In Chapter 2, research on selection methods for entry into pre-employment and part-time trades courses is reported both for Australia and for other countries. Chapter 3 provides a  description of current Australian selection processes for pre-employment courses in each of the states or territories. Chapter 4 contains a discussion of equity of access to education and the selection process, while the final chapter makes recommendations on selection, equity of access, selection tests, and research and evaluation.

        "description":"Few dissertations on vocational educational history are being written by graduate students. Reasons for this paucity of research include: (1) few opportunities exist for employment in the foundations of education field; and (2) few mentorships are availabile for those with training in both historical methods and vocational education fields. The history of vocational education has had various trends. Early 20th-century educators propagated the myth of a universal mandate for public schools. These historians tended to ignore the social and class struggles that were a part of early public education and are essential to an understanding of it. Some early educators recognized public schooling as a ladder for social mobility. The post-World War II educational historians broadened the  scope of educational history. They often fell into the class of reform liberalism. Later, revisionist historians sought a different set of motives for early school reformers. They believed that vocational education was shaped by the model of efficiency advocated by industry, and that education was made to be \"efficient.\" Vocational education was seen as keeping the lower classes in their place. Vocational education history has been largely hortatory in approach, seeking to advance its own cause. Instead of a top-down approach, however, a bottom-up approach is needed, and is being provided today by a few scholars who are doing case studies, looking at limited areas, and trying to discover what vocational education has done for former students, rather than what educators have said  vocational education should do.

        "description":"Before students can use microcomputers effectively, they need keyboarding skills. A project was conducted in Montana to teach keyboarding to fourth-grade children using computer-assisted instruction. Two fourth-grade classes at Hawthorne Elementary School, Bozeman, Montana, participated in an 8-week, 32-session elementary keyboarding pilot program. They were instructed with &quot;Microtype, The Wonderful World of Paws,&quot; suitable for grades 3-6, which was selected following a literature search. The students took a pretest and then completed the eight-week course. During the classes, it was found that more than one class period had to be spent on a lesson, especially in the beginning. Children also progressed more rapidly when the keyboards of the Apple microcomputers they were using  were covered with paper. Significant progress was reported after the eight-week session, and a posttest showed that all children had made measurable gains in keyboarding skills. However, another posttest administered six weeks after the keyboarding class had finished showed that most of the gains were not maintained. The study concluded that it is feasible to teach keyboarding skills to elementary students and they can learn well, but that they need continuous practice to maintain the newly learned skills. (KC)",

During the study, the following research activities were completed: a statistical examination of the scope and nature of firm-supplied training, 20 case studies of the training supplied by large firms representing a diverse set of industries across the country, and a review of key public policies and programs. These analyses indicated that of the approximately 5 million workers now receiving formal training in the workplace, approximately 3.5 million are participating in programs financed and organized (but not necessarily conducted) by firms. Generally speaking, training is being offered to comparable numbers of men and women; however, minorities and those individuals with the least  prior education still remain the least likely to receive firm-sponsored training. Most of the training provided by the firms studied was job specific and highly sensitive to business cycles. Although the decentralization of job training programs should be extended, policymakers should continue to recognize the importance of the Federal Government as a modest, yet necessary unifying force in shaping policies for the delivery of firm-sponsored training and should formulate legislation concerning educational appropriations and taxes accordingly.

        "description":"A study examined the training provided to workers by 20 firms across the Nation. In the 12 years between 1969 and 1981, American firms increased their expenditures on employee training from $2.4 to $3.5 million according to an analysis of data gathered by Current Population Surveys. In the same period, members of the American Society for Training and Development nearly tripled from 8,600 to 22,600. Nevertheless, the extent of firm-sponsored training appears to be related to business cycles since a temporary decrease in such training was noted during the 1981-1983 recession. Less than one-fifth of those trainers interviewed as part of this research project had been trainers in 1972. In general, the larger a firm and the more complex its services, the more likely it is to have a  management development program with a built-in strategy for developing and teaching the company culture. As corporations have changed their attitudes toward affirmative action, and as the new generation of trainers has needed to establish their profession, present-day trainers interviewed in the study tended to see themselves as part of a larger movement in which the personnel function within their firms provides an integrated approach to human resource development. (An inventory for firms to use in assessing their own training programs is included in this report.) (MN)",

        "description":"This report, comprised of five separate reports, presents a set of statistical benchmarks for gauging the growth and development of corporate training and education over the last decade. &quot;Summary Findings&quot; (Robert Zemsky) presents in capsule form the technical analyses of the findings of the other four reports. It considers these questions: how much has corporate training and education increased? who gets trained and why? what is the link between training and compensation? and does training promote employment stability? Part Two, &quot;Trends in Employer-Sponsored Education and Training: 1969-1978&quot; (Michael L. Tierney), presents the technical analyses of the four questions, in the form of an analysis of the survey of adult education, 1969 through 1978. It discusses the total volume of  employer-sponsored education and training, attributes of employer-sponsored courses, demographic attributes of participants, and the labor force attributes of participants. &quot;Employer-Provided Education and Training in 1981&quot; (Michael L. Tierney) is an analysis of the 1981 survey of adult education. &quot;The Impact of Corporate Education and Training on Earnings and Employment&quot; (Michael L. Tierney) is a modeling of the relationship between wages and training and between employment stability and training. &quot;Company Training, Employment Stability, and Employers' Needs and Practices&quot; (Ivar Berg and Janice Shack-Marquez) is an analysis of three additional national surveys of work and training experiences--the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the new National Longitudinal Survey of Youths, and the  National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972.

A brief literature review is followed by an explanation of how the researcher was urged to abandon her original intention of interviewing a narrow sample of respondents and instead interview the most diverse sample of researchers possible. The paper describes next the procedures followed, problems encountered, and insights gained during the following stages of the study: planning the project to meet specific objectives, selecting and contacting organizations or respondents, constructing the interview guide, conducting the interviews, and recording and analyzing the  responses and observations. After reviewing problems and successes while conducting the interviews, the paper concludes that the interview is a useful and workable research method. (MN)",

        "description":"A major challenge confronting vocational educators is to justify programs in economic terms. The purpose of this study was to propose and implement a cost-benefit analysis model to determine the economic outcomes of secondary vocational education programs at the local level. For the study, a cost-benefit model for secondary vocational education was proposed, submitted to a panel of experts for revision, implemented, and evaluated. The model was implemented at a comprehensive high school and an area vocational center in the Roanoke County School Division, Virginia. Four visits were made by the researchers from December, 1984, to April, 1985, to the central administrative offices and to the school sites to gather data related to costs and benefits. Further, a follow-up survey was  conducted to determine the monthly income earned and average number of hours worked per week by the graduates of each of four vocational programs. Based upon analysis of the data, the study concluded that the cost-benefit analysis model is usable and should be transportable to other secondary vocational settings. (In the specific implementation for this study, it was concluded that the trade and industrial program, the business education program, and the marketing and distributive education program were economically profitable, while the occupational home economics program was not economically profitable.) The field test of the cost-benefit analysis model of secondary vocational education programs with its findings and conclusions suggests that the Roanoke County model can be used to  determine the economic outcomes of vocational programs and is transportable to other secondary vocational education settings.

        "description":"Dislocated workers are distinguished from chronically unemployed individuals in that the former have a stable work history and are generally unaware of the community's social services programs and how to use them. Dislocated workers frequently lack job search skills and do not see the transferability of their work skills. Often, they have heavy family and community responsibilities, may have become socially isolated, and may need retraining to become employable again. Although many of these workers may have high school diplomas, they may nevertheless be functionally illiterate. Thus, dislocated workers need the following services to help them return to the labor market: coordination of community services, outplacement service to workers at all levels, support groups, information  and referral, education and training services, relocation assistance, and assistance or resource centers. The policy study is followed by an annotated bibliography of approximately 180 works dealing with the problems of dislocated workers and strategies for addressing them. Described in the bibliography are works on such topics as the characteristics of dislocated workers, the extent and causes of the dislocation problem, health and social stresses related to dislocation, social networks and unemployment, retraining and counseling needs, the role of community agencies and local agencies, and the role of the State and Federal governments.

        "description":"There are more than 70 different organizations in Jamaica engaged in some form of adult education, from university extension and professional career and skills training to social education and basic literacy. Programming for adults is currently available in the following forms: training for out-of-school youth, basic adult education and literacy training, the arts and culture, instruction delivered via the mass media, church-provided instruction, management and administrative training, and continuing education for professional personnel. As in other developing nations, adult education in Jamaica is viewed primarily as a tool for development that constitutes the main agency for social change. Compared with many other Third World countries, Jamaica lags behind in adult education at  the university level. Extensive coordination efforts are necessary to remedy the currently fragmented nature of adult education services. Improvements are especially needed in the areas of lifelong learning, teacher education for adult educators, development of a mass education movement, and adequate training in the area of management development. Perhaps the most important task facing adult education in Jamaica is to convince Jamaicans that matters of science and technology are not beyond the grasp of Third World nations and that Jamaica's subsistence-level working population can indeed become a part of a modern industrializing state.

Strategies for expanding the knowledge base and building conceptual complexity include peer education projects and use of teaching models developed to stress group interaction and assist learners with the inquiry process in these projects. In regard to building metacognitive (executive) and nonexecutive thinking skills, the FHA Planning Process provides an ideal framework for members to build metacognitive skills. Other, more direct strategies might include peer education projects involving  teaching others about the components of metacognition and investigating the use of metacognitive thinking skills in fulfilling various work and family roles. Members may study nonexecutive thinking skills themselves or incorporate them into peer education projects. Advisors can also strengthen the climate existing within FHA for the healthy development of the critical spirit by giving attention to idea- as well as skill-centered projects, encouraging respectful weighing of other points of view, discouraging hasty decision making, and encouraging reliance on self as well as experts to construct knowledge and make judgments.

Differences in students' aspirations are accommodated by offering both precollegiate and vocational education. Three essential major purposes of education are the civic, the personal, and the utilitarian. Where the civic and personal ends of education are concerned, Americans have essentially the same goals for all students. When the utilitarian ends of education are considered, more serious disagreement over curricula arises. The utilitarian ends of education are governed more by considerations of diversity. Two rival views exist regarding students choosing employment requiring less than a baccalaureate degree. One holds that what the employment-bound student needs is academic  rigor; the other, that academics are not important but training in a trade is. A new consensus among educators and employers lies in the middle: the utilitarian function of school is to assist in preparing all students for that 40-year sequence of events following graduation--for different employers, different jobs, and different trades. Three sets of attributes are needed: general skills, general knowledge, and worthy values and habits. The main objective of learning in schools must be the same for all students; differences in educational programs must never invite distinctions of citizenship. (YLB)",

The research to be disseminated emanated from the Youth Employability Research Program findings concerning employer demand and schooling effectiveness for employability. A user-driven approach to knowledge utilization involved potential users in activities ranging from giving advice to translating the research for other practitioners. Project staff collaborated with 21 national associations to develop brochures, articles, and workshops. Although project staff had to develop first drafts and sometimes complete final drafts, practitioners participated in design and review of all materials. Local education agencies  and project staff developed two inservice booklets, three classroom products, and a job search videotape for students. All school-based products were extensively enhanced by ideas and activities suggested by the educator in the field trials. In cooperation with 50 state education agencies, project staff conducted two audioconferences, using telecommunications to disseminate research findings.

The focus is on practitioners and employers and how they can collaborate to improve the quality of schooling and employment opportunities for secondary- and postsecondary-school youth. Highlights are provided from each of the nine sessions, which addressed these issues: school standards and business expectations--achieving both without compromise; becoming informed about business and the economy--collaboration provides the missing link for educators and students; the do's and don'ts of implementing collaborative programs; cooperative and experiential learning--is it worth the time away from the classroom;  preparing for the changing skill demands of the workplace--closing the gap through collaboration; technological skills--how schools and businesses can meet the challenge together; collaboration in job search, guidance, and placement--&quot;win-win&quot; strategies for students and employers; handicapped populations--collaboration equals access and success; and retraining and adult transitions--revitalizing our work force through collaboration. Other contents are background information on the moderators and panelists and a directory of participants. (YLB)",

These forces have already had an impact on the counselor's job or will have an impact in the future. Counselors should be prepared for these social changes and manage them better than their predecessors in the 1960's did. An inadequate response will maintain the status quo. Appropriate responses include: (1) identifying problems facing young people and informing the public; (2) outreach to the community; (3) greater research and evaluation; (4) creating super-counselors who perform more tasks than counselors in the past; and (5) viewing counselors as educators also. School counselors should engage in skill building activities. Professional  organizations should give assistance to counselors. University programs should offer a fine education and recognize current social forces. Counselors should use computers and other means to free themselves from recordkeeping burdens. Students wanting to work in school counseling should study counseling in a program which emphasizes school counseling. The best help to young people will be provided by counselors who are aware of current and future trends. (ABL)",

        "description":"Children are encouraged early in life to adopt socially appropriate sex-role activities and behaviors. Parents influence their children's behavior and attitudes through the toys they choose for the children and the toy play they sanction. The term androgynous is used to indicate the blending of masculine and feminine characteristics. This study examines the effects of the degree of father involvement on sex-role orientation of the fathers and the children and on the child's sex-typed toy play. It was hypothesized that increased father involvement would reduce sex-role classification. Participants included 90 4-year-old children enrolled in day care and their parents who were of middle to upper middle socioeconomic status. Both parents filled out independent descriptions of  typical weeks of their children. From this, the families were classified as high or low in father involvement. Using the Children's Sex-Role Inventory (CSRI), children were classified as androgynous, masculine, feminine, or undifferentiated based on their toy preferences. Results suggested no direct relationship between father involvement and cross-sexed toy play. The study is limited for two reasons: the total degree of father involvement was low and most of the children spent a large portion of their week in day care. Further study might examine fathers who are prime caregivers. (ABL)",

        "description":"This report, compiled by the North Carolina State Board of Education's Office for Dropout Prevention, provides dropout data, reasons for students' dropping out of school, and approaches for keeping students in school until successful completion of their education. Facts and figures for dropout rates of high school and the extended day school program servicing high risk students are presented in graphs and charts. A summary of four research studies examining reasons for students' dropping out is given with material from the studies themselves included. One of the studies described concludes that students most likely not to graduate are children of the poor and poorly educated; these children enter high school without firm direction and with low levels of achievement and patterns  of non-success early in their school careers. Many dropouts, asserts another study, feel alienation. Specific recommendations from the other two studies are given which include identifying potential dropouts at an earlier age, and looking at attendance, retention, participation in extracurricular activities, how program choices are made, and how grades are assigned to students (especially minorities) as possible avenues to reducing the dropout rates. A third section (which makes up half the document) describes promising approaches (primarily conducted in North Carolina counties) which contribute to dropout prevention and illustrate the wide range of services and programs needed to meet the various needs of individual students.

        "description":"People seeking help for personal problems usually turn to family, friends, and relatives first and then to sources such as neighborhood support systems, self-help groups, and community helpers such as physicians and clergy. These natural support systems need to be used and supported more by mental health professionals. One relationship which could be encouraged is the one between the clergy and self-help groups. The relationships and communications between these two groups were clarified in a two-part study. In the first part of the study, religious leaders (N=200), within Jewish, Catholic, Lutheran and Baptist organizations in Chicago were surveyed concerning their attitudes toward self-help groups. Results showed that 70 percent of the respondents (N=64) had made at least one  referral to a self-help group and that the religious leaders had generally positive feelings towards these groups. Even though they felt that self-help groups would be helpful, the religious leaders were aware of specific self-help groups to whom they could refer for only 54 percent of the problems brought to them by congregation members. In the second part of the study, a consultation session was provided for a sample of the religious leaders who had never made a referral to a self-help group. The results showed an observable increase in activities involving self-help groups following consultation, suggesting that mental health professionals can provide the clergy with information and resources about self-help groups in their communities.

In a preface, Senators Heinz and Glenn note the following significant events of l984: (1) Congress reauthorized the Older Americans Act; (2) a strong economy with low inflation helped Social Security and Medicare avoid financial difficulties; (3) health care costs are still increasing dramatically and will continue to do so with increasing percentages of older Americans; (4) subgroups of the elderly including the sick, very old, minorities, and widows still suffer high poverty rates; and (5) reassessment of the Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Older Americans Act programs will occur in 1985. The main text of the document is divided  into five parts. Part I, Retirement Income, includes chapters on Social Security, employee pensions, taxes and savings, and employment. Part II, Low-Income Assistance Programs, contains chapters on supplemental security income and food stamps. Chapters in Part III, Health, deal with health care and long-term care. Chapters in Part IV, Housing, examine housing programs and energy assistance and weatherization. Part V, Social Services, contains chapters on the Older Americans Act; social, community, and legal services; personal safety and consumer issues; and civil liberties. These sections include discussions, statistics, tables, and graphs. A section of supplemental materials includes a list of 1984 hearings and witnesses, a list of committee prints and reports printed by the committee in  1984, names of committee staff members, and a publications list.

        "description":"The perceptions of burden in providing care to the disabled elderly by a family member may be affected by the caregiver's personal and social resources and by the differences in involvement and familial roles between the caregiver and the care receiver. To test this relationship, 41 spouse and adult daughter caregivers involved in a home-based treatment program completed the 29-item Zarit Burden Interview and a checklist of their participation level in 10 caregiving tasks, and rated the incidence and severity of the care receiver's specific behavioral problems. Adult children caregivers reported sources of burden which were outside the caregiver/care receiver relationship, with major stressors being the influence of concurrent role demands and financial strain. Spouse caregivers,  on the other hand, reported sources of stress within the caregiving relationship, with major burdens being personal functioning, especially in direct caregiving tasks, and interpersonal relationships with the disabled spouse. These findings suggest that fundamental differences exist in how elderly spouses and adult daughters define and perceive their roles as primary caregivers. (ABB)",

        "description":"Mental health services are often unavailable, inaccessible, or inappropriate for the children and families who need them. In order to implement a more effective system of mental health services to children and adolescents, an adequate system of care must be defined and described, and a policy mandate to implement such a system must be developed. As part of a continuing program of research on mental health policy for children and adolescents, a study in one state was conducted which involved: (1) a survey of all community mental health centers; (2) a compilation of data from the state's management information system; and (3) in-depth interviews with stakeholders in the mental health system. Key figures (N=49) in the development of the state's mental health system over the last 30  years and 18 additional current stakeholders in the state's mental health system were interviewed within a qualitative research framework. The interview data showed that the major factors influencing policy development and implementation were economic and political, not scientific and professional as traditional viewpoints might suggest. These results support the view that the traditional treatment-oriented and positivist-empiricist approach is inadequate for studying, understanding, or influencing mental health policy. Needed is a focus on the economics and politics of the policy implementation process, including value considerations (in addition to traditional study of the treatment process) and the use of qualitative methods to complement the positivist-empiricist approaches most  widely used in policy analysis and progam evaluation.

Since this difference is only partially explainable on the basis of fewer years in higher education, a study was conducted to determine men's and women's perceptions and experiences of writing for publication in the field of counselor education. A sample of 82 counselor educators balanced by sex, academic rank, and appearance or non-appearance as authors in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) between 1966 and 1983 was drawn from the fifth edition of a national directory of counselor education programs. Subjects completed a questionnaire on job activities, professional memberships, journal subscriptions, and recollection about having had mentor experiences. In addition, SSCI respondents were asked to  recall perceptions, impressions, and judgments of variables that might bear differently on women's circumstances in scholarly work compared to those of men. Comparison group subjects were asked their views about writing for publication and any barriers or difficulties bearing on research and writing they perceived as present in their work or personal situations. The results indicated that more SSCI members had assigned time for research, engaged in fewer non-job professional activities, and had more statistics courses in their training than did non-SSCI subjects. Comparisons between women and men revealed two significant differences: the number of statistics courses taken in training, and perceptions of institutional emphases on writing for publication. Women reported less access/entry to  writing possibilities within departments than did their male colleagues. They also noted lack of confidence and training, and the pressure of family responsibilities and commitments as conditions affecting publishing opportunities. Overall, women perceived a lower institutional emphasis on publishing than did men. (Author/ABB)",

Participants were primarily Protestant, Caucasian, and of higher socioeconomic status. The results showed that only 10 percent of respondents indicated overt death anxiety while 51 percent were death acceptors. Responses indicated ambiguous feelings about death, with females being more open to expressing these ambiguous feelings than were males. Females also reported beliefs in reincarnation and afterlife more than did males. Data analysis revealed  that death anxiety had no relationship to age; older respondents had no more death anxiety than did younger respondents. Generational differences were suggested by similar views on religion and drugs expressed by the younger and older cohorts as opposed to the middle-aged cohorts. The results suggest that environmental factors and generational differences are more important than aging in the formulation of adults' views of death. (ABL)",

        "description":"Transitional situations, such as those experienced by work study students, may create cognitive difficulties by requiring people to simultaneously use both a learning and a use logic. To examine this phenomenon, a problem solving task (electrical schemata of a washing machine) was administered to 43 full time students and 51 work study students studying electricity. The schemata was administered before and after a 2-week on-the-job training program for work study students. Data analysis revealed five categories of errors. With regard to these categories, both full time and work study students presented roughly the same pattern of mistakes on the pretest. Comparison of pre- and post-test results, however, revealed that full time students showed a significant decrease in the number  of mistakes made while the nature of the errors stayed the same between the two tests. Work study students maintained a constant number of mistakes between pre- and post-tests, but the nature of the errors changed. These results suggest that full time students experienced no disruption in the evolution of their mental representation while work study students experienced interference with the evolution in the learning logic and a change in mental representation. This change in mental representation might be seen as a first step in a cognitive process of integration of the learning and the use logics. (NRB)",

        "description":"The major purpose of this monograph is to provide counselors in elementary and secondary schools with information on learning style to enable them to diagnose the learning style of each student, utilize counseling interventions that complement individual learning style preferences and consult with teachers and parents regarding the accomodation of student learning style preferences in the classroom and at home. Application of the learning style approach is described as involving: (1) assessing the learning style of each student; (2) identifying patterns within the counseling caseload for grouping students according to learning style preferences; (3) interpreting learning style requirements of students for counseling purposes and applying complementary counseling approaches; and  (4) evaluating student outcomes as a result of using the learning style model. Case studies are provided to assist counselors in applying the model at the elementary and secondary school levels. The learning style needs of special populations (gifted, physically disabled, school dropouts) are described. Descriptions of counseling programs that use learning preferences in counseling are provided. Research studies are outlined that show evidence that using the learning style approach in teaching and counseling results in improved academic achievement, more positive attitudes toward school, and selected developmental gains, such as increased career awareness.

The document provides background on the definition and treatment of cataracts and describes IOL implantation procedures, the IOL industry in the United States and abroad, and IOL utilization, including numbers and costs. Medicare payment for cataract surgery is also examined. Current problems are detailed, including efficacy and safety; cost; kickbacks, discounts, and rebates; and no cost advertisements. Results from surveys of ophthalmologists and the IOL industry regarding their experiences with fraud, waste, and abuse  in the area of cataract surgery are analyzed and a conversation with an IOL salesman is reported. Current regulatory activity involving IOL enforcement, approval, and reimbursement is detailed. Policy recommendations, based on the findings, are listed and supported by the conclusion that cataract surgery is fraught with fraud, waste, and abuse but can still be provided with some improvements in program administration and legislative changes. A glossary of terms specific to the cataract industry and an anatomy of the eye are included. Several appendices present surveys of ophthamologists and the IOL industry, information supplied by the Food and Drug Administration and the Health Care Financing Administration, and marketing materials of the IOL industry.

Rather, the purpose of home care should be to meet immediate needs of recipients which they can no longer meet themselves. Publicly-funded home care was evaluated in a study which employed quality of circumstance, a construct which includes observable conditions and behaviors such as eating regularly, having a clean residence and clothing, and ability to go out. Participants were selected from 1,068 elderly hospital patients who were functionally disabled, of low or moderate income status, and able to sign a consent form. Four months after hospitalization, participants (N=633)  who had returned to home settings were interviewed on quality of circumstances subscales, including shelter, privacy, safety, household supplies, eating, choice, laundry, clothing, housecleaning, quietness, and activity. The quality of circumstances measure gave a detailed picture of living conditions linking specific problems to quality of circumstance subscales. Refinement of the scale should include improved item content, subscales corresponding to functioning measures, and improved format. (ABL)",

Several reasons for the lower rate are suggested, including the possibilities that American children are in better health, fewer children are hospitalized unnecessarily in the United States, or some children are not receiving needed hospital care. A comparison of Canadian and U.S. statistics is included because of the two countries' similar hospital structure and data. Data are presented in three areas. Hospital use is compared using data on age and sex, diagnosis,  surgical procedures, newborn infants, and hospital fatalities. Health status is compared using morbidity, mortality, and cause of death data. Health services are compared using supply and distribution of resources, physician utilization, and health insurance data. It is concluded that: (1) children in the United States had lower discharge rates for upper respiratory infections but higher infant mortality; (2) ambulatory care appeared to be used more in the United States than in Canada; and (3) more U.S. children were uninsured than were Canadian children.

The investigation of bias related to either gender or gender-related attributes requires a scale to address both the gender-relatedness of characteristics and how positively or negatively the stereotypical characteristics are viewed. Twenty masculine, 20 feminine, and 20 neutral gender-related characteristics with positive connotations related to employability were selected for the development of the Positive Sex Role Inventory (PSRI). The 60 attributes were placed in an instrument and presented to 284 undergraduates who rated the attributes for their desirablity for a  counseling psychologist. Analysis of this instrument showed that the scale had a three-factor structure and satisfactory subscale internal consistency reliability. Five masculine and feminine item pairs were then identified from the subscales so that the mean difference between the rating of the two items was not statistically significant. This study yielded two experimentally useful products: the PSRI can be used in experimental research involving positive sex-role attributes and the set of five item pairs developed to be of equal market value provides a potentially useful methodology for sex bias research.

Although developmental research with both children and adults has tended to assume the validity of a structural model of cognitive development, this assumption may be invalid when applied to the social cognitive judgments of adults. There are two basic concerns in examining the area of social cognition in adulthood. First, the concept of social cognition, its measurement and definition, cannot be simply conceived in a unitary fashion. Social judgments across a variety of different situations suggest patterns of heterogeneity and inconsistency across empirical studies. Secondly, social cognitive understanding represents development of the personal domain of knowledge. Knowledge in  adulthood becomes increasingly domain-specific and expert. Adult competence within the logico-mathematico domain alone appears incapable of explaining the social cognitive skills of adulthood. However, domain-general descriptions of the unique qualitative dimensions of post-formal thinking by themselves are not sufficient to account for the emerging facility of adult social cognitive expertise. Social cognitive performance in adulthood is simultaneously marked by the growth of both post-formal thinking styles and expert knowledge within the personal domain. A reference list is appended.

        "description":"The Gerontology Alcohol Project, a treatment/research program investigating the characteristics of the late-life onset elderly alcohol abuser, was used as a model for a new program which emphasized teaching the elderly abusers how to break down their personal drinking behavior chain and deal with the antecedents of drinking behavior, to use general problem solving skills, and to understand consequences of alcohol abuse. Physical health, mental health, social/family relationships, legal problems, and financial problems of the 67 program participants were also assessed for effects of alcohol abuse. The results from administration of the Drinking Profile revealed that most physical/medical problems were related to episodes of drinking, that the majority of abusers lived alone and  had a small social network, and that few financial or legal problems relating to alcohol abuse were found. Antecedents of drinking behavior were markedly different for older abusers than younger abusers. Intrapersonal rather than interpersonal antecedents of alcohol abuse were common in the elderly. The elderly abuser's antecedent depressed mood was related to the drinking episode rather than to peer pressure or anger as in young abusers. Most younger abusers consumed alcohol in social settings but most elderly abusers drank liquor at home alone. Elderly alcohol abuse was found to be related to loneliness, lack of social contacts, age-related changes, and intermittent depression and did not cause major psychological/interpersonal impairment.

The individual's skills relevant to living independently are assessed and those individuals with deficits enter an appropriate treatment program. Two of the treatment programs or modules help the individual adjust to the community. The Community Resources Module teaches information about Social Security payments, places to go for activity, and public transportation, and how to practice these skills. The Social Support Module emphasizes using the individual's existing social support network and increasing it by making new friends. Program participants (N=77) completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Life Satisfaction Scale, and Social Support Network  Inventory. The results revealed that graduates of the program significantly increased the size of their social network. The graduates' self-esteem rating increased and their depression rating decreased. These individuals were referred because of their risk of being institutionalized but this project demonstrates that this risk can be lowered by improving the elderly person's social skills. (ABL)",

It is critical not only to recruit new volunteers but to retain volunteers. This study examines hospice volunteers for motivation and rewards. Previous studies have found motivations to include altruism and self-actualization and rewards to include social interaction and recognition. Forty hospice volunteers (29 females and 11 males) completed a questionnaire and Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale. Participants were asked what kinds of activity they performed and their primary reason for volunteering. Fifty-two percent cited inner-directed reasons indicating personal interest or benefit. Thirty-eight percent cited other-directed reasons  indicating concern for others. Other respondents combined inner- and other-directed reasons or did not cite reasons. The hospice volunteer directors were questioned about rewards. Rewards included certificates of appreciation, banquets, service pins, bookmarks, free meals, and free parking. Little relationship was found between volunteer motivations and reward structure. Agencies could be more creative by taking into account the needs and talents of the volunteers when creating job descriptions and roles thereby probably reducing volunteer burnout. It is also probable that supervision as needed over and above the supervision regularly supplied provides the support, encouragement and rewards most valued by these volunteers. (ABL)",

A 1970 study by Broverman, Broverman, Clarkson, Rosenkrantz, and Vogel found that both male and female clinicians ascribed more positive characteristics to males and fewer desirable traits to females. Research disagreeing with this position and failing to replicate the study is cited. Other research showing that clinicians tended to reject female patients who exhibited masculine traits such as assertiveness is cited as support for Broverman. Two theories, the labeling theory, and the higher male social status theory which account for possible bias are discussed. Several studies relating disorders to male and female gender type expectations are reviewed. It is concluded that females are judged  as maladjusted when exhibiting gender role incongruent behavior.

        "description":"Much research on masculinity and femininity has relied on the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and similar androgyny inventories. Recently, investigators have questioned whether self ratings on androgyny inventories reflect salient dimensions of the self. The relations between spontaneous self descriptions and the respondent's gender and gender role were examined in 503 undergraduates. Males and females categorized by their responses on the BSRI short form as masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated provided open-ended responses to the query \"I AM\" which were coded according to their gender-related and gender-neutral content. Results indicated that gender role influenced the frequency with which gender-related traits were used in self descriptions. Persons categorized  as masculine or feminine more frequently used desirable masculine and feminine personality traits, respectively, in their self descriptions. Androgynous persons used both sets of desirable traits in describing themselves. These findings suggest that androgyny inventories, such as the BSRI, may provide valid measures of desirable masculine and feminine traits in the self concept. However, there was little correspondence between gender role and self references to gender behaviors. Moreover, the predominance of gender neutral traits in self descriptions suggested that the salience of gender to the self concept may be overestimated. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Until recently, kindergartens were designed to foster a positive attitude toward school and provide a well-rounded development through the use of suitable play, art, and social activities. Unfortunately, many kindergarten programs have begun to rely on inappropriate materials and techniques taken from formal first-grade programs. Such programs reflect a skill-based perspective with activities and tasks hierarchically ordered. Instruction usually means the teacher presents a skill and then the children practice it on materials that are arranged by difficulty of words and sentences. An alternative approach is one that draws on the notion of reading as a thinking and understanding act and learning to read as a constructive, problem-solving process. This means that while children can  be given information to learn and practice in a stepwise fashion, they must interpret the ideas and relate them to their own knowledge and experience. Three principles guide these alternative programs: (1) learning to read is supported when a classroom features familiar printed information and interesting literacy activities; (2) learning to read requires the use of diverse materials and a wide variety of tasks that are directly or indirectly related to reading, writing, speaking, and listening; and (3) learning to read is an active process.

        "author":["Reeve, Robert A."],
        "description":"Two experiments were conducted to determine whether children remembered information more efficiently if they were provided with an explicit purpose for learning. In the first experiment, 96 5-year-old children watched a simple science demonstration and were told either to remember the names of the depicted items from pictures for a memory test (rote memory group), to learn the names of the items because they were needed for a second science demonstration (embedded memory group), or to tell the experimenter whether they thought they had seen the pictures anywhere before (incidental memory group). Except for the incidental memory group, all subjects were told that their recall would be tested immediately or after a one-hour delay. Results indicated that children in the embedded  group employed mnemonic strategies (rehearsal, elaboration) more frequently and studied longer than children in other groups, but only children tested immediately recalled more. The second experiment, using the same set of materials and procedures with 65 5-year-old children from the same population source, investigated whether omitting mention of the time the children would have to remember would minimize their concern and, in turn, lead to elevated recall. Under this condition, the performance of the embedded delay and the embedded immediate groups was equivalent. These data show that 5-year-old children can use task appropriate strategies if the memory task is embedded in a purposeful, motivating activity, but the effort is dependent on the nature of the task content and other factors,  such as doubts about one's competence, which may intervene and affect performance.

The first two sections of the paper, which concern the importance of reading in work life and the importance of reading assessment in the Army, provide the basis for addressing the overall issue of reading assessment in the Army. The reading theories presented in the third section are helpful in generating evaluative criteria for reviewing potential measures of reading for Army use. In the fourth and fifth  sections, three categories of measures are considered: civilian, military, and the special case of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)--a military test of general cognitive ability with potential value as a surrogate reading measure. The sixth section deals with scoring issues that should be addressed regardless of which measure is used. The final section offers conclusions based on both theory and practice: (1) reading is important in military and civilian work life; (2) reading assessment is a highly visible and important issue in the Army; (3) reading theories--especially the interactive-inferential theory--can positively influence Army reading measurement practices; (4) reading tests differ widely in terms of psychometric characteristics and overall quality as  evaluated using theory-based standards; (5) high correlations exist between ASVAB and various reading tests, although caution should be exercised when using any part of the ASVAB as a reading surrogate; and (6) available alternative grade equivalent scores should be considered for use by the Army.

Frames, the text and graphic images that appear on the computer screen at any given time, come in at least four types: (1) instruction frames designed to present goals and directions to the students, (2) information frames that present a sequence of explanations and examples about specific reading skills, (3) response frames that ask students to show what  they have learned from the information frames, and (4) hint frames that provide specific explanations to students for each incorrect response that they make. While each modifiable reading software package is unique in some feature or procedure, all allow for at least some versatility and ease in creating new lessons, changing existing programs, adding or removing items from new or existing programs, and making corrections.

One category of thinking skills programs uses the cognitive process approach on the premise that thinking abilities depend upon certain fundamental processes. Thinking skills programs that present a strategic approach to thinking are called heuristics-oriented programs, and focus on an intellectual route to problem solving. The Piagetian approach groups thinking skills in a developmental scheme. In another perspective of thinking skills, it is believed unlikely that one's language competence can be enhanced without a corresponding improvement in one's ability to think and vice versa. In yet another category, thinking with its identified subskills should be taught as a subject in itself. Closely related to the teaching  of thinking skills is the &quot;thinking about thinking&quot; model called metacognition. Researchers are suggesting that examining how one thinks will increase and strengthen thinking skills.

Analysis of the results indicates that the nation's reading programs seem to be moving toward holistic programs, which stress comprehension and problem solving, and away from lock-step mastery learning programs that stress subskills and memorization. Some problems identified are a lack of time for teachers to provide individual help and for students to practice their skills, classes that are too large, and lack of flexibility in school programs. Teachers have a positive view of the principal as  the administrator of the program, but as a director of learning resources rather than as an administrator who assertively directs teachers' efforts. Principals rated teachers high in terms of classroom environment, individualized instruction, and understanding and supporting the school's philosophy of reading, but indicated that their greatest shortcoming is in their lack of creativity in reading instruction and their reliance on commercial materials.

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the effects of high and low relevant text underlining and annotating (making margin notes or other marks to indicate important material) on test performance. The subjects, 67 college freshmen, were randomly assigned to one of four experimenter-generated conditions: (1) high relevant underlining; (2) high relevant underlining and annotating; (3) low relevant underlining; or (4) low relevant underlining and annotating, or to a control condition in which students generated their own text markings. During two sessions, all subjects took a test of prior knowledge, read an assigned passage, and took a 24-item multiple choice test consisting of 12 high and 12 low relevant questions. Data analysis showed that subjects in the high relevant condition  answered more high relevant questions correctly while low relevant subjects answered more low relevant questions correctly. Subjects who generated their own underlining did not perform significantly better than did those who were given experimenter-generated underlining. The findings show that researcher underlining and annotating have the effect of directing students' attention and are as effective as student markings. However, experimenter markings place different demands on the reader, greatly reducing the number of his or her decisions as to what is or is not important, thus making the reading task easier.

        "description":"Intended for parents and all citizens concerned about improving Chicago's 592 public schools, this handbook explains how important reading is to a decent education and future employment. Chapter one describes the school improvement campaign called &quot;Schoolwatch,&quot; the problems in the Chicago public schools, and the components of effective schools. Chapter two analyzes what it means to know how to read; it explains how reading is tested and evaluated in the Chicago public schools and what the scores mean. It also shows how to look at reading scores for the school system as a whole, for one's own school, and for a child. Chapter three describes in depth the ten ingredients that researchers have identified as crucial for an effective school. For each one, a &quot;report card&quot; gives parents  specific things to look for to help them decide whether their school measures up and where there is room for improvement. Chapter four describes how decisions made &quot;downtown&quot; affect the way that children learn (or do not learn) to read in Chicago, and tells what changes are needed so that the school system's huge bureaucracy serves the local school. Finally, chapter five tells exactly how parents, business people, community groups, and journalists can work together in Chicago's &quot;Schoolwatch&quot; program to improve the schools. (HOD)",

        "description":"As part of a larger study on the levels experienced by deaf children in acquiring knowledge about printed letters, words, and stories, an investigation was undertaken to discover the effects of a reciprocal teaching method on deaf children's learning of four prereading skills--finger spelling, book reading, story reciting, and word recognition. Subjects, 23 prelingually deaf kindergarten and first grade students with severe-to-profound and profound hearing losses, met in groups of five or six for 30 minutes each week with the teacher. The teacher read and signed an experimental storybook containing three to five new words in a picture context with a manual sign illustration. After discussing the new signs, the children performed a number of activities involving the four target  skills. In addition, the children took the books home to read with siblings, parents, and friends. Gains made in prereading were measured through pretesting and posttesting. Results indicated that the reciprocal teaching procedure could build prereading skills in young deaf children. The training was beneficial for students with a wide range of abilities. (FL)",

        "description":"To determine whether story mapping would improve reading comprehension, five intermediate grade students with mild learning handicaps and poor comprehension were prepared to use story mapping procedures as a schema-building technique. As they were reading, students learned to identify the setting, problem, goal, action, and outcome of narrative stories. The primary dependent measure was a set of responses to ten explicit and implicit comprehension questions. Secondary dependent measures were length of story retell, a comparison of story retell responses to comprehension question responses, standardized reading tests, generalization probes, and listening comprehension. Results showed performance of all five students improved on most of the dependent measures. Four students  demonstrated increased ability to answer comprehension questions, maintained performance after intervention, and increased tendency to mention story mapping components in their story retells. The remaining, and much slower, student improved marginally on most measures, despite the fact that his slow progress did not enable him to complete a maintenance phase. Three students' performance also improved on comprehension of more difficult classroom reading materials. Five pages of references, and tables and graphs are appended. (Author/HOD)",

A multiple baseline design across two groups was used to demonstrate group control. A model-lead-test teaching paradigm was used to shape comprehension responses to a level of independence, without teacher assistance. The three major findings of the intervention study were that (1) both experimental groups improved on daily story comprehension as a result of learning to use a story mapping  technique, (2) all five low achieving and learning disabled children showed similar improvement, and (3) the progress of the normally achieving children was not impeded by including low achievers in the group instruction, thus by-passing use of ability grouping.

        "description":"None of the current issues in education have much to do with education; they are politically, socially, or economically based, and opinions tend to be presented as facts. For example illiteracy statistics are inflated. Virtually all children have the opportunity to learn to read and write at school, and the majority of them do. Neither is the adult literacy problem an epidemic. Bilingualism in the schools has also become politicized, and those making pronouncements on bilingual education are not necessarily experts in the field. Students with so-called learning disabilities and dyslexia can be helped more by instruction than by the mislabeling that brings more funds into the schools. Rudolf Flesch has kept the phonics issue alive, but teaching phonics to children who already know  how to read is like teaching the basics of driving to people who know how to drive. Because of the increase in working mothers, there is a trend toward earlier formal education with a focus on reading, although the benefits of such instruction are not proven. Schools spend money on word processors for composition instruction to improve thinking skills, when it is clear thinking that leads to clear writing. Finally, textbook publishers rush to respond to the politics of the states with the largest textbook contracts. Nevertheless, what many in education have been saying for years is now being said by persons in power. If educational issues are put into a proper, realistic perspective, they can be solved. (HTH)",

Subjects, 37 randomly selected seventh-grade students, read an &quot;Opin&quot; passage, prepared by deleting the second half of every other sentence. The blanks filled in by students were evaluated using a scale based on the response's resemblance to the author's intent. Responses were also divided into fragmented, projective, and interactive categories. Oral readings of a second, intact passage were used to determine the kinds of reading miscues made by students. The results confirm that the Opin sentence procedure has sufficient interrater reliability to be used for assessing a reader's ability to interact with text during silent  reading. Both the percent score method and the category scoring method proved reliable for reading assessment purposes. The pattern of correlations with the miscue scores also indicates that readers who attempt to interact with the text while reading are more likely to make miscues that are consistent with their search for meaning.

The first paper describes a study that examined the English reading ability of both kindergarten and first grade children in immersion programs and compared the results with those of children in regular English classrooms. The paper concludes that children in both groups were equally knowledgeable at the beginning and end of kindergarten, that both groups gained competence in reading related skills over the year, and that children in the immersion program did not fall behind their peers in regular English classes. Copies of measures used in the study are appended to this paper. The second paper, a response by Mia Beer  Toker, raises concerns about (1) the theoretical position and model of reading presented in the study and its environmental validity, (2) the comparability of the teaching approaches evaluated in the study, and (3) the question being addressed in the study--the nature of the skills being transferred from French to English reading. This paper concludes that education in Canada is at a point where it should be concerned with research that views reading as an interactive process, the purpose of which is to transfer meaning, rather than with the ability to manipulate specific, discrete skills.

Revising for correctness includes varying or limiting the assigned revision tasks, varying the length of writing and revision assignments, assigning several distinct tasks of reading and revision of a single piece, varying the timing of rereading or the amounts reread, assigning collaborative rereading and rewriting, suggesting rereading aloud, intervening directly in the rereading and rewriting process, and using the holistic process of rereading for errors. Revising for creating meaning and content begins with helping students find good  topics to work on, then uses oral or written brainstorming sessions to show how topics can be narrowed or broadened. Some aspects of revision by adding meaning include supplying examples or details left out, adding specific information to support generalizations, straightening out problems of logic, or otherwise clarifying a text. Along with adding meaning, revisers must cut out nonessential material, which includes removing &quot;deadwood&quot;--words or details that are vague, roundabout, repetitive, obvious, unnecessary, or contradictory.

In 1880, however, he invested $2,000 in an early typesetter invented by James W. Paige. Both Clemens and Paige dreamed of immense wealth that would be generated by selling thousands of Paige Compositors. Clemens' fame as an author and humorist lent a certain aura to the proceedings. Both men were sustained by an unshakeable belief in the ultimate success of the Compositor. Newspapers, toward the end of the 19th century, were keenly interested in a revolutionary device that would lower composition costs, increase profits, and expand the amount of reading matter. The Paige Compositor, with Clemens as its principal promoter, impressed both  printers and publishers. Paige, though, tinkered with its design so frequently that no practical test of the Compositor could be undertaken until 1894. The machine, with its 18,000 parts, was judged to be too complicated and too expensive for practical use. Only two prototypes were built, and Clemens lost his $190,000 investment. The Paige Compositor approached the marketplace too late for serious consideration by newspapers and printing companies. Capitalists declined to finance it. By the mid-1890s, the state of the art had passed over the Paige and its brilliant capacity to set, justify and distribute foundry type. The Linotype, which composed type lines in a hot-metal process, became the popular machine at newspapers and printing offices. (Author/HTH)",

Summaries of the limitations and key findings of the research on process are included. The second chapter explores research on the repertoire of lexical, syntactic, or rhetorical forms which writers call upon in their writing. The third chapter examines criticisms of experimental studies and the difficulties in doing them, then explains the  techniques used in the meta-analysis of such studies, the selection of studies, and the variables examined. The next four chapters analyze the studies in the areas of modes of instruction, grammar and the manipulation of syntax, criteria for better writing, and invention. The eighth chapter presents the results of the meta-analysis for the dimensions examined: grade level, duration of treatment, mode of instruction, focus of instruction, revision, and feedback. The final chapter discusses the compatibility of results of treatment or method studies with those of processes studies, and offers recommendations for future research. (HTH)",

In addition, a purposive sample of 52 leaders of neighborhood organizations who had an interest in one or more of four issues was interviewed. Residents and leaders were asked to identify the neighborhood's most important problems or issues. Among the issues of greatest concern were crime, housing, physical appearance of the neighborhood, economic development, and chemical dependency of many residents. The order of emphasis by neighborhood residents varied, however, by  education. The agenda of the leaders as a group correlated most highly with the agenda of the most educated. When definitions of the issues were examined in detail, the relative emphases by the neighborhood press bore comparatively much less relationship to the emphases by neighborhood residents. It was concluded that organization leaders were more influential in defining issues than the neighborhood press, and that leaders exerted the most influence when public attention to issues and knowledge about them were low.

However, other issues such as \"performance vs. knowledge,\" the affective dimension, and the situational nature of competency are still being researched and debated. Five suggestions for instructors who teach basic interpersonal communication courses are (1) review various conceptualizations of interpersonal competence and select factors deemed crucial for students to possess, (2) select a basic textbook that treats those factors, (3) encourage students to critically examine their own behaviors, (4) use exercises that  provide the opportunity to observe others who possess useful skills and that provide opportunities to practice in a nonthreatening environment, and (5) allow students to make their own choices.

Researchers used the four types of management styles used by Likert: exploitative authoritarian, benevolent authoritarian, consultative, and participative. The study sought to (1) assess differences in PD's perceptions of organizational characteristics across market and department size, and (2) determine how such personnel characteristics as personnel stability, job satisfaction, and productivity vary according to organizational characteristics in U.S. television stations. Questionnaires were completed by 181 (66.1%) PDs at 274 randomly selected United States television stations. The  results of the questionnaire indicated that management principles and practices are homogenized throughout the industry and relatively so over different sized markets and departments. Significant differences occurred in the areas of leadership, control, and decision-making, indicating that PDs affiliated with the largest markets and departments perceive their stations' organizational styles to be more participatory than PDs at small or medium-sized stations. Job satisfaction among PDs was generally high to very high. Personnel stability and productivity did not appear to vary, despite differences in organizational characteristics although greater job satisfaction was found to be tied to the more consultative management styles. The findings showed that PDs oriented toward higher levels of  management style in their operations expressed greater job satisfaction. (HTH)",

Subjects, 29 males and 38 females from three speech communication classes, completed the Irrational Beliefs Tests (IBT) and the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA). The results of analyses indicated that totally irrational beliefs and six of the ten subtests were significantly related to CA: demand for self approval, high self-expectations,  frustration reactivity, anxious overconcern, problem avoidance, and dependency. Three of the IBT subtests were significantly related to CA for the males: frustration reactivity, anxious overconcern, and problem avoidance, while four were significantly related to females: demand for approval, high self-expectations, anxious overconcern, and dependency. The results provide support for the link between irrational beliefs and CA, but offer none for the notion that irrational beliefs are more strongly associated with other dimensions of CA than public speaking, and little clear support for the hypothesis that the irrational beliefs associated with CA are dependent on gender.

The five-year study is a four-pronged behavioral change program directed at seventh graders who attended all the public schools in three Iowa cities. Two experimental and one control group were exposed to an anti-smoking curriculum during the first year of the study. Subsequent developments to be implemented in the experimental communities include knowledge reward, community competition, student involvement, and community involvement. The major  problem encountered in this study was the difficulty of reinforcing group efforts to reduce smoking without having a negative effect on group bonding or attachment. Although problems clearly exist in trying to apply theory to real life, further research should be conducted because theory has no practical value unless it can be of some use in society. (DF)",

Although these guidelines are not always easy to follow, they assume that people can learn from their mistakes and call for people to acknowledge their behavior, take responsibility for it, and improve it.

Therefore, more adult-focused courses in communication are needed because adults tend to be interested in communication problems rather than communication subjects and value learning that makes use of their experiences. One model that fulfills those requirements and could be used as the basis for curriculum change is the Adkins Life Skills Structured Inquiry learning model. This model consists of four stages: (1) Stimulus Stage, in which students are stimulated to learn by a provocative presentation; (2) Evocation Stage, in which goals for the curriculum are established; (3) Objective Inquiry Stage, in which students explore what outside sources know about their subjects; and  (4) Application Stage, which allows students to evaluate their behavior to determine if objectives have been achieved. Two prerequisites are required for instituting the program. First, the curriculum director must evaluate the target population. Second, the instructor must maintain a nonthreatening classroom climate. The program will allow students to develop their skills in ways most valuable to them. (DF)",

However, such strategies as reward association, self-inclusion, similarity, openness, supportiveness, and conceding control were not often used.

A scale was designed that includes items related to four communication contexts--public speaking, talking in meetings, talking in small groups, and talking in dyads--and three types of receivers--strangers, acquaintances, and friends. The instrument was administered to 428 college students as were two other instruments that measured communication apprehension and self-reported  verbal activity.

        "description":"The study examined whether an animal naming task would discriminate between 286 normal students (grades K-9) and 123 language disordered students (5-16 years old). The task was of a free and controlled association type for identifying word retrieval problems. Each subject (S) was administered the task individually in the school or clinic setting. The mean number of responses were computed across grades for both groups. Steady increments in scores were found for both groups through the fifth grade. Normal language Ss produced more animal names than their language disordered grademates in 8 of the 10 grades, although differences were not significant at any grade level. It is concluded that three aspects of lexical accessibility need to be explored to gain insight into the results:  word frequency, codability, and age of acquisition. (CL)",

The oral language situations tested were the monologue, dialogue, and polylogue or group conversation on a topic. An American inventory of common speech subjects was used to construct test situations, and the test subskills were drawn from the students' textbooks. The situations, subjects, and subskills were combined into three tests, which were administered to 14-year-olds in all areas of the country and all dialect regions. The tests were taped, and teachers were asked to rate the dialogue and monologue tests on content, organization, language, delivery, and communication. The interrater reliability and  homogeneity of assessment criteria were analyzed statistically. On the whole, it was found that the two test types were closely correlated and that overall scores would have sufficed for ranking students in the case of almost all raters. However, when only one rater is available, as in a classroom testing situation, the analytic method of scoring is preferred to the overall scoring method. (MSE)",

Resulting vocabulary research directions are suggested in two major areas: test types and student populations. It is recommended that research on test types focus on how to tap partial knowledge of word meanings and their effect on vocabulary size estimates and on estimation of vocabulary in the context of discourse  comprehension and production. It is also suggested that the student populations studied be extended to include lower stages of vocabulary development, end-of-secondary school and university students, students with more training in word analysis and context utilization, and students at different ability levels. In addition, theoretical inquiry on the nature of vocabulary learning, teaching, and research is recommended. (MSE)",

A test was administered to foreign nationals in the Netherlands who were applying to teach their native languages and cultures to preschoolers. The test, intended to measure the first two factors, consisted of an oral proficiency test of authentic language behavior, a standard multiple-choice test, a multiple-choice test of orthography and morphology, and a cloze test. Analysis of the data found similar results for  measurement of language proficiency by evaluating language behavior and by testing implicit knowledge.

Communication partners have their own interaction competence based on cultural background and individual factors. Even the perception of the interaction is culturally-based. For example, in Finnish-German communication, the process is affected by differing attitudes toward: the various usages and connotations of time (in daily life, in the response time within the interaction itself, and in the organization of the discourse);  verbalization of the obvious; nonverbal communication; the use of names; connotations of words and phrases; money; and the form and presentation of the discourse. It is part of the task of a language teacher to point out these cultural factors, because in cross-cultural communication there is always at least one person with the role of a foreigner. While no one can attain perfection in cross-cultural communication, efforts in this direction are always rewarded. (MSE)",

Each of these processes is more difficult in the relatively young but highly pluralistic nations of Africa. A community-based model of language planning offers ways to alleviate or rectify some of those problems by the use of a decentralized and more participatory approach to the language planning process. Whereas African governments feel compelled to assume most of the responsibility for all stages of language planning, more local-level input and activity could provide greater benefits at reduced cost. The community-based language planning model (CBLP) includes establishment of a community language center at the  geographic or demographic center of the language community, which would be requested by the community and staffed by trained local native-speakers. The community would be responsible for the material needs of personnel and operations and for public relations. Certain language tasks, such as instructional programs and literacy projects, would have to be accomplished within a predetermined governmental time-frame. CBLP claims to offer a more direct route to successful planning and implementation by making language managers aware of public needs and usage, by making users aware of language planning agencies' products and services, and by creating a demand for those services.

The report focuses on the following topics: (1) the country, the people, and the languages in contact (regional varieties, the normalized Malagasy, and French); (2) the linguistic issues and political influences; (3) the types and functions of the languages in contact; (4) the conditions of usage of the official Malagasy, dialects, and French, including passive and active situations in which the languages are used in written and spoken forms; and (5) the attitudinal factors  in the usage of each language. It is concluded that Madagascar has functionally differentiated language varieties and that, when the speaker has a choice of language to use, the choice is made according to function. The Malagasy diglossic situation is not one of strict complementarity, primarily because of the political and sociohistorical situation. (MSE)",

However, it does require that all ideas and techniques be reevaluated in terms of this wider conception of communication and learning. One method for combining new and old approaches integrates part-skills training, or pre-communicative activities, and whole-task practice, or communicative activities. The two branches of the model, the conceptual and the communicative, are linked at one extreme by creative language use (discussion, problem-solving, role-playing and simulation, purposeful reading and listening, learning through the foreign language, and fulfilling needs) and at the other by the  internalization of structures and vocabulary. These objectives are accomplished on the conceptual, or meaning, side by situational teaching and information exchange tasks and, on the communicative or functional side, by functional teaching and role-playing tasks. Whatever the nature of the syllabus input, the links within the model allow the teacher to address various aspects of language, language usage, and language learning. (MSE)",

        "description":"Discussions of the communicative approach to language teaching are often confusing because different definitions are ascribed to communicative competence in the teaching context. Its definition as the appropriate use of the sociocultural rules for language use in spontaneous interaction is preferred; this definition makes possible more precise testing of communicative proficiency. An ethnographic study of features of effective classroom activities in bilingual education has these implications for the communicative approach and instruction in English as a second language: (1) good teachers do make a difference; (2) methods and materials are not as important as meaningful and interesting activities, on-task focus, clear activity objectives, and comprehensible feedback; (3) to the  degree that teachers can incorporate these principles in their classroom activities, students should learn English. It seems, moreover, that communicative language teaching by its nature already does, or easily can, incorporate all of these features. Whether or not the communicative approach is adopted, an approach to language teaching that incorporates genuine communication in the classroom is desirable. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of the optimal combination of language students for participation in an oral group exercise used a story-creating activity in which each student was required to memorize a single sentence and, by discussing the sentences with each other, arrive at a sensible order for them. Three types of verbal interaction were recorded: repetition of the memorized sentence by its \"owner,\" ordering of sentences, and seeking and giving clarification. Four groups of eight students each were studied: one high-proficiency, one low-proficiency, and two groups with four high-proficiency and four low-proficiency students. It was found that repetition was evenly spread within and among groups, that sentence-ordering was more common in the homogeneous groups, and that clarification depended on  proficiency in the target language and relationships within the group. Further research into the kinds of group composition and activities that contribute most to learning is recommended, focusing on three arrangements: superior-inferior, in which one learner has all the information; combining, in which each learner has different information; and cooperating, in which each learner has the same information and in which the participants work together. A final observation is that the teacher has an important role to play in facilitating learning and providing the most favorable opportunities for participation in language activities. (MSE)",

The focus of the syllabus is direct communication from the ancient to the modern world through reading skills, supported by writing and, to a lesser extent, by listening and speaking skills. The syllabus incorporates development in logical and productive thinking and cultural awareness. The concept of communication as interaction on a particular topic, in a specific situation, for a definite purpose or function is the foundation of the syllabus. The elements of topic, situation, function, and proficiency level are identified for elaboration in the process of curriculum  development. The syllabus insists on a continuity in the development of both language and cultural skills from Latin to English, and it provides proficiency guidelines for several levels. The syllabus encourages individualized program structures suited to districts of differing size and needs, not by prescribing specific methodology or instructional materials but by defining the elements of thoughtful curriculum development for creative teachers to undertake.

The aspects discussed are: teaching and evaluation objectives, criterion- and norm-referenced measurement, stages in construction of criterion-referenced tests, construction and selection of items, test validity, and test reliability. Examination of the literature shows that criterion-referenced and norm-referenced measurement share some features, including dogmatism in its introductory stage, but that criterion-referenced measurement (CRM) has the advantage of providing an exact description of an individual's performance level in an entire domain, not only on the presented items. When test construction and interpretation are done correctly, the desired result occurs  because of CRM's emphasis on the conceptualization of measured domains. Because tests are the most concrete way of signaling to teachers and students what the desirable content and forms of teaching are, and because testing has a limited scope, it is suggested that focusing on testing in instructional development may be more effective than focusing on curriculums and teaching materials.

Statistical analysis of test results from students representing two different ability levels in different years indicate that the curriculum change may have had a negative effect at both levels of achievement.

High-status law firms choose new associates from the most prestigious schools, while low-status schools tend to channel their students into local law practice because of their lower prestige and power within the profession. As unfair as hierarchical ranking of schools might seem today, the profession is far more meritocratic than it was in the early days of the republic. Attention is directed to: early American legal education, class  conflict in legal education, the battle over the shape of legal education in Boston, Boston law schools in the 1920's, Harvard Law School vs. Suffolk Law School and confrontations about day and night law school programs, the background of Suffolk students, the status of Suffolk graduates in 1928, the contemporary hierarchy, and implications for the future.

There is a possibility that the coming into force of equality rights may remove mandatory retirement. It has been estimated that by 1989 removal of mandatory retirement would result in approximately 300 fewer new faculty being recruited and an increase in operating costs due to the retention of higher salaried faculty. Concerns of AUCC include: in the absence of mandatory retirement, the lack of career opportunities for young and promising scholars will be further aggravated; already limited financial resources for universities will be further drained either by the retention of a  more expensive professoriate or by the costs of alternatives to mandatory retirement; in the absence of mandatory retirement policies, the human practices of institutional loyalty that allow termination of employment through retirement of once productive scholars may well be replaced by the disciplinary actions resulting in termination for cause; and the loss to the body of knowledge resulting from the lack of career opportunities for young and promising scholars may outweigh the benefits of the removal of mandatory retirement.

Enrollment data for 1950-1984 are presented for full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate students, and the percentages of women for each year are also indicated. Full-time undergraduate student enrollment is related to the population of 18- to 21-year olds, and full-time graduate student enrollment is related to the population of 22- to 24-year olds. The importance of university degrees for future employment is shown by data on unemployment rates by levels of educational attainment. While there is need to provide students with skills and knowledge that are  marketable, the most highly specialized professionals have acquired their first degrees in the humanities or the social/pure sciences. This pattern enables graduates to respond to a variety of changing demands and to make the transition through several careers. Universities help develop graduates with the skills to compete in the international market place and to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies. Universities also conduct research needed within education and the larger society. (SW)",

There has been a general progression from a focus on the generic form of clinical reasoning to an emphasis on medical content that supports the reasoning process. This has led to investigation of the nature of physicians' understanding of medical problems and the role of the basic biomedical sciences in clinical thinking. Studies of expert and novice diagnosis in pediatric cardiology have shown the importance of: medical knowledge in clinical thinking; and hypothesizing in case solution. Other research has assessed problem representation in a medical field and how it influences radiological  diagnosis. Bill Clancey, a researcher in artificial intelligence at Stanford, has studied expert diagnostic performance rules and traced back underlying cognitive structures that give rules their conceptual meaning. Clancey used MYCIN heuristic programming in studying clinical diagnosis. Patel and colleagues at McGill University have focused directly on clinical understanding (based on theories of comprehension and the field of discourse processing) and have examined inferences by experts aimed at supporting clinical actions. Other lines of research are also noted. Four pages of references are included. (SW)",

Nearly one-half of the states have minimum admission requirements for public institutions. Nine states have an open admission policy, while 13 states require entering freshmen to meet a test score, minimum grade point average (GPA), class rank, and/or other performance standard. Nine states require or recommend a prescribed pattern of high school course work. Eleven states allow their  colleges to impose additional admission requirements. A majority of the colleges in only one-half of these states, however, chose to raise performance standards. Sixteen states have recently enacted, or are proposing, more stringent admission policies. In every case, these changes include high school course-work requirements. Over half of the states do not have statewide admission policies.

The importance of stimulating college students and sharing the faculty member's intellectual interests is addressed. It is suggested that learning thrives in an atmosphere of \"intellectual collegiality.\" Based on the view that good scholars make the best teachers, it is suggested that individuals are often attracted into the professoriate by the excitement of learning on the frontiers of learning. Learning needs to be revitalized in such a way that teaching is natural, vital, and honored. The nature of inquiry should be examined to determine why it has become routinized, subordinated to guild and institutional interests, embattled in  the public arena, and seen by the young as inflicted upon them. It is important to question whether reward systems at both graduate and undergraduate levels send messages to students that technical skill in conducting studies is more valued than insight and wise judgment about the issues involved. The view by many young faculty that they were not taught how to teach is addressed, along with the view of many parents and alumni that more job-related instruction is needed at the undergraduate level.

Almost 200 faculty responded in some way to a solicitation, and a roster of potential lecturers, resource persons, and facilities available was compiled. To meet teachers' need for greater access to the intellectual resources of the university, two new programs were instituted: a scholarship program enabling teachers to enroll in  university courses at no cost, with or without credit; and a visiting fellow program, which allows teachers to pursue continued scholarship. A free workshop for math teachers consisting of six 2-hour meetings was provided by the university in spring 1985. Additional workshops and special programs for school administrators have also been offered. Continuing needs include obtaining financial support for workshop programs, scheduling professional development programs, and locating the program in the university's administrative structure. (SW)",

In this regard, Hispanics fare worse than Blacks and Asians. In 1980, Hispanics earned 2.3% of all bachelor's degrees and 3% of all doctorate degrees awarded in the United States. At present, a majority of Hispanics attend community college. These students, generally, neither transfer nor receive  degrees. Current financial aid policies have reduced Hispanic access to sources of student aid, since there are more applicants and declining resources. In addition, increasingly complex application procedures and stricter eligibility requirements act as a barrier to access for Hispanics. There is a need for improved community college instruction and counseling, as well as better coordination between two- and four-year colleges. The overwhelming number of Hispanics enrolled in four-year colleges are Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico. (SW)",

The review was conducted at the request of U.S. Representative James J. Howard who proposed the bill. H.R. 2620 would require colleges to graduate at least 75% of their scholarship athletes within 5 years in order for contributions to their athletic departments to qualify as tax deductible. The two studies are: (1) &quot;National Collegiate Athletic Association Survey of Graduation Rates After Five Years for Males First Entering College in Fall 1975,&quot; prepared by the American College Testing Program; and (2) &quot;Study of Freshman Eligibility Standards Technical Report,&quot; prepared by Advanced Technology, Inc. For each study, attention is directed to the  characteristics of the sample, the quality of the data, and data analysis. It is concluded that both studies have limited relevance for the legislation. The bill is directed at athletes who remain at the same college and receive athletic scholarships for 3 years. Both studies reported graduation rates for athletes and nonathletes only for freshman college entrants rather than for those who had been enrolled for 3 years. Serious methodological problems were also found in each study. (SW)",

        "description":"A preceptorship model of clinical teaching for medical education is presented. Based on the view that physicians use precepting skills in patient care, preceptorship is seen as an opportunity for medical students to learn to practice ambulatory medicine away from the medical center. A model called \"Johari Window\" is adapted to explain the preceptor's role, and specifically the kinds of information people bring to every action: knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The model clarifies the two functions of clinical teaching: assessment and instruction. Assessment involves questioning, professional intimacy, and observation, while instruction involves shared experience, role modeling, and demonstration and practice. The model also includes feedback and evaluation. Five levels of  questioning can be used to assess a learner's knowledge. Assessing professional attitudes and behaviors is analogous to assessing patient health care beliefs. Ways to encourage the preceptee (and patient) include developing rapport and genuine interest, and being accessible, empathetic, and nonjudgmental. The techniques of brainstorming, questioning, challenging, and summarizing are helpful in making the student a more active learner. Additional techniques for instruction, demonstration and practice, and feedback and evaluation are suggested. (SW)",

Principles that are helpful in implementing each method are discussed. For lectures, the following principles are recommended: attract and maintain attention; make  only one or two major points; make the organization clear; use helpful audiovisual aids; and use a conversational speaking manner. Principles for grand rounds include: selecting an important case, selecting knowledgeable and interesting speakers, orienting speakers to discuss, not lecture, and eliciting audience participation. Principles helpful for seminars and journal clubs include constructively dealing with difficult situations, and bringing to closure both the group process and learning objectives.

Originally designed to provide feedback to university teachers alone, the system is now used extensively by teachers to gather information for themselves as well as for departmental committees and student groups. The system is also used on a more limited basis in program evaluation. Recently, IDQs were used to collect student reactions to both foreign-educated and American teaching assistants (TAs) at the university. Initial ratings of both groups of teaching assistants were far below university norms, but ratings improved after one semester of teaching. It is suggested that a TA's  first semester ratings are open to misinterpretation and that verbal facility is very important to teaching. IDQs (and similar course evaluation systems) were found to provide useful information for teachers wishing to improve their teaching, but the proportion of teachers who will use this type of system voluntarily is probably small. In addition to providing useful data for administrators and committees deliberating about personnel, these systems can also provide useful data for students choosing classes. (SW)",

The sample consisted of 105 students in the experimental group and 65 in the control group; the latter group received instruction via a traditional lecture-laboratory approach. Data from pre- and post-assessments using the Audio-Visual Student Attitude Inventory (experimental group only) and the Inventory of Scientific Attitudes were treated by analysis of covariance. Applications of the t-test to the results indicated that such  positive factors as cooperation and cohesiveness did not diminish in the IAT group as they did in the control group, and such negative factors as cliqueness, favoritism, and competition did not increase in the experimental group as compared with the control group. Although students in the experimental group expressed favorable attitudes toward some aspects of the IAT method (performing experiments individually, development of independent thinking, self-examination, rate of learning, and self achievement), no changes occurred in their attitudes toward science and understanding the process of science as a result of being instructed in an IAT setting. The only major difference between the boys and girls was that girls expressed more favorable attitudes than boys toward the individualized  aspects of the IAT method. Three data tables and a three-page list of references complete the report. (Author/JB)",

The sequence of the learning activities in relation to four problems which were raised during the implementation process are presented: (1) administrative problems at the school level; (2) administrative problems in the laboratory, classroom, or technical level; (3) classroom management problems; and (4) teacher-student behavior. These problems are identified as important because they have an impact on the reciprocal process of the implementation phase on one hand, and the formative evaluation of the learning units on the other. Four charts are included which provide: the scheme of a sequence of learning activities in an IAT  lesson; sample card used by students to record their learning unit activities; the learning process of an IAT in a typical classroom; and a comparison of teachers' and students' behavior in conventional courses and IAT courses.

        "description":"To detemine the effectiveness of the Individualized Audio-Tutorial (IAT) method of instruction, an IAT unit in biology was implemented in ninth grade classrooms in an urban school in Israel, and student achievement was measured in relation to gender, academic background in mathematics and biology, and IQ levels. The 180 subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group (N=105) and a control group (N=65). Students were pretested for prior knowledge of biology, and an achievement test was administered at the end of each learning unit. Data from both academic achievement in biology and mathematics and scores on three intelligence scales were used to cluster students at three levels. The mean scores in the three IAT units were compared using analysis of variance, and  significant differences were found: (1) low achievers in mathematics and biology obtained low scores on the IAT units; (2) middle and high level achievers received higher scores with the IAT approach; and (3) similar results were found for the control group, which had received traditional instruction. It was also found that the girls' achievement was equal to that of the boys when the IAT method was used. Differences between the results of this study and the findings of a study which included kibbutzim school students are discussed.

The incremental drum and line printer plots communicate often vast and difficult-to-interpret tabular data with or without geographic coordinates. All the software packages are easy to understand and require no prior programming knowledge or skills. Due to the multi-discipline nature of graphic display, computer generated plots are an excellent tool for use in the classroom to illustrate sociological, geophysical, business, and mathematical concepts.

The study had a 70% response rate and analysis by the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS-X) shows that faculty favor decentralization of online information retrieval services as long as the institution underwrites the cost; faculty are not willing to pay for the services themselves.  However, a large percentage of the faculty also favor centralization of online services and will use trained librarians rather than learn how to use the services at their own expense. Faculty feel the online reference services enhance, not endanger, the faculty status of librarians. Faculty approve of faculty status and rank for librarians at Slippery Rock University where librarians have had faculty status and rank for many years. Associate and full professors, as well as those who say they use the library more frequently, show a better attitude in this regard. (Author/THC)",

The component consisted of two parts: a self-guided tour with questions, and basic library research skills guides with worksheets (both are appended). A special research assistance desk was also set up in the library. In spring 1985, an evaluation was done to determine the frequency of use and satisfaction of students who used the research desk, to determine the effectiveness of the library research skills guides and worksheets, and to identify problems and make suggestions. Data were collected from student questionnaires, faculty questionnaires, reference librarian  questionnaires, a research process log sheet completed by students, and a course transactions sheet. From the data it was concluded that the research assistance desk was viewed favorably by both the students and faculty and the basic library research guides had clear instructions. Some problems were identified (e.g., too many students assigned to one topic), and several recommendations were made that have been implemented (e.g., have the special desk again).

A survey instrument was mailed to all 50 SEA's with a 94% return rate. Well over half of the SEA's were involved to some degree in the evaluation process or will be in the very near future, but this involvement for most is in terms of quality control versus creation of evaluation procedures. While the best evaluation procedures incorporate sound and effective evaluation practices, the content validity of the evaluation instruments is weak and there is little sense of a cohesive role. Recommendations include a call for the national associations to  determine and disseminate a professional role to aid SEAs who might be creating or revising evaluation instruments.

Participants were presented with descriptions of documents varying in topic area (related or not related to their expertise), amount of information, and whether the document was relevant or irrelevant to the search. Results revealed no difference between experts and nonexperts in their accuracy of judging relevant documents but experts were better able to discern that irrelevant documents were, in fact, irrelevant. Judgments based on abstracts were more accurate than judgments  based on keywords or bibliographics, which did not differ, and this effect was more pronounced for relevant than irrelevant articles. Participants who had previously conducted more literature searches or published more research reviews made more accurate judgments as did searchers high in cognitive complexity or tolerance of ambiguity. Data are also presented on how the independent variables related to confidence in relevance judgments, familiarity with the literature, and general beliefs about topic areas. Results are discussed in regard to prevailing beliefs about the literature search process and how the process might be improved. (Author/THC)",

        "description":"Bad or low morale exists wherever people are dissatisfied with themselves in relation to their environment. In recent years, there is evidence that declining morale has become a problem of national proportions in education. Dwindling enrollments and funding, a changing student body, and curricular adjustments, compounded by the inability of schools to attract and hire new young scholars with fresh ideas, have combined to be extremely unsettling factors. Teacher distrust of and conflicts with administrators have been intensified by collective bargaining and the rise of more militant, professional unions. These recent developments are usually blended with more traditional elements of faculty dissatisfaction, such as bureaucratic routine. Ideally, morale problems would be most  desirably and successfully addressed as a joint effort of faculty and administration. The reality of the situation, however, is that administrators should take a leadership role, restraining both their enthusiasm and impatience, sorting the causes from the symptoms of low morale, and considering the following: (1) morale is often misperceived as an institutional phenomenon, but organizational morale is really a collective expression of individual feelings; (2) the quality of corporate morale is relative and lies in the eyes of the beholder; (3) good morale must be preserved by ongoing programs, while bad morale can only be corrected by a unified, collective, methodological, and extensive schedule of problem identification and response; and (4) administrators, staff, board members, and the  community have a morale factor, as well as faculty.

Five of the 12 mainstreamed children were mentally retarded, and seven had a slight developmental retardation mainly due to deprivation. Observations of 10-minute duration, totaling 4 hours and dispersed across 7 days, focused on (1) time each child spent in active communication; (2) qualitative aspects of this communication; and (3) the child's behavior while alone. Findings indicated that deprived children did not differ much from the &quot;ordinary&quot; children. However, the observations of the five mentally retarded children differed significantly. The mentally retarded children were not socially integrated, were significantly more often alone, were alone for longer periods,  and played noticeably less with other children than the &quot;ordinary&quot; children did. Most of the children communicated only short periods of time with an adult. Mentally retarded children needing practical help received a little more time with adults. While positive about integrating the children, none of the staff considered their own role as an active one in the integration process. Results are discussed in the context of day care centers as learning environments and implications for the development of all children. (RH)",

Interviews focused on the system by which decisions are made, variation of working tasks, the meaningfulness of work, the goals of the preschool activity, the possibility of personal development for staff, the communication system, and the strain in work. Most of the personnel were to a great extent satisfied with their working conditions. Staff members thought that they had the same work tasks, despite differences in the education of preschool teachers, nurses, and special teachers guiding children's use of leisure time. Work goals were of a general  nature, mostly concerning care of the children. Half of the group considered experience as being more important than education. Most respondents felt that they had too little contact with central administration and that they did not get enough feedback in their work. The splitting up of the day by different routines and the arrivals and departures of children and adults at different times were seen as strain factors. Another strain factor was working in groups of children in which the age span was very large (1 through 10 years). Personnel also indicated that they received too little further education and had too little time for work with individual children. The survey instrument is included. (RH)",

Child care centers, family day care homes, Head Start programs, and resource and referral agencies have reported that their liability policies are not being renewed, that premiums have become prohibitive, that coverage for child abuse claims is unavailable, and that policies are being cancelled with little or no notification. Emphasized is the availability, the quality, and affordability of child care and the critical role that insurance plays in determining those factors. Apparently, the insurance industry is going through a period of retrenchment, a reexamination of its own role in the economy and its  entire way of conducting business. Various viewpoints from child care providers and representatives of the insurance industry are reported. In addition, a 43-page booklet entitled &quot;Child Care and the Family,&quot; by David Friedman et al. and published by the National Child Abuse Coalition, is included and discusses the use of child care services in the prevention of child abuse.

More specifically, it was thought that preschoolers with both a father at home and a male teacher at school would have a slightly more positive self-concept than preschoolers with either a father at home or a male preschool teacher. In turn, this second group of preschoolers was hypothesized to have a higher positive self-concept than those preschoolers with neither a father at home nor a male preschool teacher. Subjects of the study were 230 preschool children drawn from Head Start programs in Texas which employed male teachers. Children were assessed through use of the Self-Concept and Motivation Inventory (SCAMIN) which  measured overall self-concept in relation to school. Results showed that having a significant male in the home and having a male teacher significantly improved the self-concept of the student; however, this significance extended only to the male students in the study. Because the original hypothesis was only partially supported, it was concluded that the influence of male teachers, in general, does not seem to extend to children on those variables over which the teachers have only an indirect influence (i.e., gender concepts and attitudes toward school and self).

        "description":"This final report describes activities undertaken by three school districts in the Austin, Texas area to monitor the implementation of the Employer-Supported Parental Involvement in Education (ES/PIE) Program, an initiative of the Working Parents Project (WPP) of the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL). The ES/PIE program was designed as a set of activities that schools and school districts, as well as employers, could implement to increase working parents' involvement in the education of their children. After a brief overview of the WPP and related background information, the project goal and objectives for fiscal year 1985 are delineated. Major project activities and accomplishments are reported; these concern the expansion of the project's database on  collaborative efforts in SEDL's region, monitoring the implementation of the Business/Employer component of the ES/PIE, promoting the implementation of ES/PIE, and the refinement of practical guidelines to assist school personnel and corporate officers in ES/PIE implementation. Concluding remarks briefly comment on other programs directed toward working parents, other forms of school/business collaboration, time needed to implement the ES/PIE program, the importance of school district size and resources, facilitative characteristics of business/employers, and the importance of leadership by educators. A bibliography of nearly 50 pages, organized into twelve topics, is appended. (RH)",

This final report in the study describes a survey questionnaire distributed to over 1,000 parents in New Orleans, Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston. The previous parent survey (1982) did not obtain sufficient response from urban populations to provide a complete information base. Survey results support previous findings about parents' involvement and interest in educational matters. In addition, the report  recommends actions for both parents and educators to increase and sustain parent involvement. Contents covered in the report include the following: background information; project plan; major activities and accomplishments; major conclusions and recommendations; significance of project accomplishments; deliverables; selected references; and attachments.

More than 100 second and third grade children from Tallahasee, Florida schools took an apperceptive aggressive test to determine aggressive modality and then completed a portion of the Paradigmatic-Syntagmatic Language List to assess language maturity. This study was designed to test the following hypotheses: (1) there is a significant negative relationship between language maturity and physical mode of aggression when sex and social class are held constant, and (2) there is a significant positive relationship between language maturity and verbal mode of aggression when sex and social class are held constant. Results indicated that physically aggressive children selected the  physical mode regardless of sex or social class, refuting previous research in the area of aggressive behavior. The best predictor for physical aggressive expression appeared to be language immaturity. Additionally, the results indicated that verbal aggression may be the result of language maturity although its predictability was not as strong as physical aggression. In the case of verbal aggressive expression, sex was the single best predictor. (DST)",

Simple games, rhythms, and dance are not sufficient to insure fitness, for, during the regular free play situation, children very seldom experience physical activity of enough intensity to promote cardiovascular fitness. Fortunately, something can be done. The Health-Related Physical Fitness Test, inaugurated in 1980 by the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance, emphasizes a philosophy which focuses upon good health and disease prevention. Aspects of the philosophy include cardiovascular endurance, muscular endurance, flexibility, and balanced body composition. Basic benefits of  health-related physical activity are numerous. Included in this document are a guide for planning fitness activities in daily lessons, examples of activities for enhancing fitness among young children, and a weekly plan with illustrative activities.

This report, focusing on child care, summarizes costs and benefits reported by private sector employers; compares and contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of the four options; describes  the federal government's current involvement; and estimates the cost of such assistance for federal employees under various assumptions of the level of subsidy, annual per child costs, and number of children sponsored. In conducting the study, current literature was searched for information on the advantages and disadvantages of each child care option, and existing day care centers at various federal agencies were reviewed. In addition, the study includes survey data on dependent care assistance needs from a review of federal employees' attitudes on alternative work schedules.

Some cost reduction may be realized through certain economies of scale in some consolidations but it is by no means automatic. The Illinois State Board of Education emphasizes the relationship between high school size and program offering, school size and student achievement, and school size and the number of planning preparations by teachers as the primary rationale for encouraging school consolidation. In scrutinizing the relationship between school size and quality, however, the consolidation movement should probe fundamental questions regarding the economic and quality-of-life relationship between schools and rural communities, factors important in  providing quality education (including richness of curriculum, quality of teachers, and parochialism among students) and their relationship to school size, and the vision of quality education in rural schools. Strategies that should be utilized in consolidation planning are sharing of students or teachers between buildings, utilizing instructional technology, restucturing high school grades, reexamining course scheduling, and examining regional/state initiatives. Issues that should be considered in implementing consolidation include deemphasizing bureaucratic aspects, consolidating across regions, maximizing teacher quality, providing transitions for participation in extracurricular activities, and supporting schools during and after consolidation.

Topics include development of the training program, delivery system, methods of instruction, evaluation of the inservice program, and explanation of the post inservice use of computers in the consortium schools. A discussion of the suggested principles of consortium operation covers the need for a clear advantage to  cooperation, optimal number of members, geographic proximity and size of member schools, leadership, organization, finances, and the use of outside resources. Background material includes a description of the roles to be played by small school consortia, a review of literature concerning the use of computer technology in rural schools, and a history of the Mid-Missouri Small School Consortium (MMSSC) with attention to features that made for successful sharing of services.

        "description":"Collaborative strategies were used by The College of Saint Rose (CSR) and 15 rural school districts in upstate New York to implement preservice teacher training and programming to better meet the needs of handicapped learners in rural settings. Through meetings and questionnaires, rural administrative teams identified relevant skills and issues that preservice teachers need to work effectively with handicapped students in mainstreamed settings in rural areas. This input, along with conclusions drawn from literature reviews, provided the basis for preparation of a Rural Education Resource Booklet to assist CSR faculty in adopting a curriculum infusion approach to include rural components in their education courses, with emphasis on problems of teaching mainstreamed handicapped  students in rural settings. The booklet contained an introduction and rationale for teacher preparation for rural service, gave five key competencies for teaching handicapped children in rural areas, and identified several major objectives for teaching each competency. The booklet also suggested content for teaching these objectives through educational profiles, readings, activities, dilemmas, simulations, discussion questions, transparencies, resource lists, and information on new technology. By fall 1985, two student teachers had been placed in participating rural school districts and nine CSR faculty members had incorporated rural materials into their courses. (NEC)",

Material is organized under three group training sessions with a detailed sequence of activities and suggestions for leaders included for each session. Session 1 covers establishing a comfortable climate for the group and introducing the topic and the participants. Session 2 focuses on learning to talk about sex. Activities include  small group discussion, films, and communication games for speaker-listener pairs. Session 3 explores the child's view of sexual issues and the value of touch in Indian culture. Additional information includes discussion of the changes made in adapting the program for Indian cultures, evaluation forms for participants, and self-evaluation questionnaires for leaders. The bibliography includes titles of 8 books, articles, and films used in the training program and 37 additional books and audiovisual resources. (JHZ)",

        "description":"An estimated 44,340 longer term resident households in rural Kentucky were studied to identify the variables that explained changes in household income status between 1974-79. In a nine-county area of south-central Kentucky, rapid employment growth between 1974 and 1979 created new job opportunities, but employment growth did not benefit all households or reduce the area's overall poverty level. For households located in the study area continuously between 1974 and 1979, the average relative income changed very little. Although 28% reported improved relative incomes, another 22% lost ground when household members either retired or reduced their annual work hours. Households headed by elderly persons maintained their relative incomes because they depended on public or private  income assistance programs that were indexed to the Consumer Price Index. Households headed by women had limited benefit from the area's employment growth. Most of the women who benefited from the job growth lived in households headed by men. About 21% of the longer term resident households were classed as poor in both 1974 and 1979. The heads of these households were typically older and had lower educational attainment than heads of households never classified as poor. Forty-eight references and the regression models used in the study are appended. (JHZ)",

Findings show that the project (which  provided supplementary instruction, academic counseling, and other services) appeals to well-motivated, high achieving students. It sets high goals for them, teaches them to work both independently and in groups, and in so doing, prepares them for the kind of work conditions that are frequently encountered in research laboratory and high technology think-tanks.

        "description":"The New Mexico Solar Energy Institute (NMSEI) education program has attempted to influence teachers to increase the quantity and quality of teaching about renewable energy sources and their uses. Since 1982, the program has used the following methods for influencing energy education: a newsletter for educators; conference and classroom presentations for children, their teachers, and preteachers; development and distribution of a curriculum package for an adult education course; distribution of instructional materials; participation in a national energy education day project; and the donation of laboratory equipment. Each of these program activities is described. Also described is the evaluation of several program components, including: (1) the newsletter (asking how many people  read each copy, which sections of the newsletter are most useful, and if teachers use its suggested activities in the classroom), with results based on 207 responses out of 1,000 included with the fourth issue of the first column of the newsletter; and (2) the curriculum package with content related to a solar home, based on 39 surveys (86 were mailed) returned by students who completed the course. Overall, these and the other program activities have been successful in increasing teaching about renewable energy. (JN)",

In addition, information on test development, test design, test administration, and on scoring and reporting is provided. Also included are highlights of findings and recommendations. Among the findings are those showing that the general level of mathematics achievement among Oregon eighth graders is greater than  60 percent of students nationally, that student performance in arithmetic skills was at an excellent level (with the exception of basic operations involving fractions), and that student performance in estimation and probability was lower than desired (with more emphasis recommended, including inservice programs to upgrade teaching skills related to both of these skill areas). One of the recommendations offered is to train and use mathematics resource teachers and to implement peer coaching strategies to assist teachers in the instruction of low performance areas.

        "author":["Kulm, Gerald"],
        "description":"Recent research has provided a reasonably coherent picture of how children learn to add and subtract. There is clear evidence that children do not learn simply by mastering a procedure and storing in memory. Instead, learning is structured in meaningful ways, connected to previous knowledge, and adapted to new contexts. This view of learning has important implications for the way arithmetic should be taught in the first or second year of school. This paper discusses: (1) the &quot;part whole&quot; concept (which refers to the idea that a number can be interpreted as a whole and two parts; (2) strategies children invent to add and subtract; (3) addition strategies (direct modeling, counting strategies, and number fact strategies); (4) activities to develop direct modeling, counting, and  number fact addition strategies; (5) subtraction strategies (direct modeling strategies, counting strategies, and derived number facts); (6) activities to develop modeling, counting, and number fact subtraction strategies; (7) incorrect inventions and errors; and (8) drill and practice.

        "description":"This study assessed the effect of group size and presentation mode on acquisition of the process skill of forming and testing hypotheses and selected attitudes. Preservice elementary teachers (N=87) in five intact classes received two 1-hour sessions presented by microcomputer, 1 week apart. Half of the subjects were assigned to three-member cooperative learning groups; the rest worked alone at the computer. Matched problem situations which required the forming, testing, and revision of hypotheses were presented as color simulations to one-half of the subjects and as exercises to the rest. The effect of group size and mode of presentation was found to depend on subjects' initial hypothesizing skills and formal reasoning ability. Subjects with low formal reasoning skills  benefitted more from small group interaction than from working alone. Subjects with higher formal reasoning ability also performed better after receiving textual exercises than similar subjects who interacted with color computer simulation. Also, cooperative group learning and color computer simulation were more effective than individual learning and computer text in elevating learners' perceived success in using the computer and attitude toward the program being used. It is suggested that pre-assessment of learner aptitudes is needed before prescribing a mode of computer presentation or group size. (Author/JN)",

This instrument, the Test of Computer Literacy for Science Teachers (TCLST), is part of ENLIST Micros (a project to develop a curriculum for training science teachers to use computers). The instrument, based on essential competencies for computer literacy for science teachers developed and validated for this project, will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ENLIST Micros curriculum at developing those essential competencies in science teachers. In addition, TCLST can be used as a diagnostic test by universities and school districts to determine if teachers have previously achieved computer literacy and also for various purposes by researchers. A 12-step procedure for  developing and validating criterion-referenced tests is being used to develp the TCLST. Results of the first eight steps are reported and discussed: preliminary considerations; review of objectives; item writing; assessment of content validity; revisions to test items; field test administration; revision of test items; and test assembly. The test is being piloted with over 200 preservice and inservice science teachers in 10 sites. Results of the pilot study will be used to establish instrument reliability and its construct and decision validity. (Author/JN)",

Primary emphasis was given to reviewing published and unpublished reports that have resulted from the national assessment and the frequent special data collections which have also resulted from it, as well as on integrating the findings into tables and text of special relevance to the 1984 edition of &quot;Science Indicators.&quot; In addition, the report files and test score files of the National Teacher Examinations (NTE) were examined for similar evidence and results that may confirm  or disconfirm the NAEP results. Other data sources (such as the Educational Testing Service Advanced Placement Program) were also examined. Results and recommendations are reported and discussed separately for national assessment, national teacher examinations, advanced placement scores, and for other data sources. One recommendation (related to NAEP) is that all scales purporting to measuring the same concept should be on a common scale. Among the findings is that the NTE data filed proved to be of limited value as a source of science indicators. (JN)",

Using groups of between three and five college volunteers, subjects were seated in booths constructed so that they could not see each other, were given forty dollars in play money and a wagering board, and were told that they would use the money to make a series of wagers during two phases of the experiment. Subjects in Phase I were informed that whether they won or lost was simply a matter of lack, determined by the role of a die. Phase II involved competition against one another in a game of skill. Of particular interest was whether persons winning would offer aid to any of the  other not so lucky players. At the completion of 12 rounds of wagering, subjects completed questionnaires and the amount of money returned by each recipient was carefully recorded. Contrary to previous research, it was found that neither the amount of resources possessed by the donor, nor the level of obligation attached to the gift, significantly influenced the recipient's attraction to the donor. It was also found that (1) more money was repaid to the low resource donor than to the high resource donor; (2) one's attraction toward another is independent of their actions (however; when it comes to teaming up with another person, their actions become important); and (3) the amount of money a subject loaned when placed in a winning condition was not a function of the previous condition they  were in.

        "description":"Using Amitai Etzioni's (1961) sociological model as a basis for analysis, the paper examines the relationship between central student characters and their chief reference group or significant other(s) in the schools as portrayed in three films: &quot;If&quot; (1969), &quot;Child's Play&quot; (1972), and &quot;Educating Rita&quot; (1983). Two variables are employed: the kind of power used over the students and the students' involvement or orientation toward the people or system wielding this power. Following a theoretical background describing the various types of power and compliance structures presented in Etzioni's model, each film is analyzed separately. The paper also warns educators against taking compliance structures of the school or classroom for granted and suggests that educators (1) do not rely  solely on coercive means to gain student compliance since conformity is purchased at the price of student alienation from the educator and all he/she represents, thereby preventing the internalization of the affective portions of the curriculum, (2) take heed of the student social system and its potential power over the behavior of its members, and (3) do not stray from the professional role of the educator who places student's welfare above his/her own. Teachers who confuse personal social goals with professional goals present students with conflicting expectations for performance, and may undermine the very objectives they are employed to attain.

Focusing on sales levels that must be achieved to enjoy targeted profits in favor of the usual approach of emphasizing how much will be sold within a given period, a sample situation is provided to illustrate this approach. In this situation, the eight-step method helps a married individual with a working spouse, dependent children, and a $25,000 per year job determine how many sales dollars a new retail operation must provide during its first year to make quitting his/her present job a reasonable risk. A format for computing a projected statement of net income (or loss) is provided to help determine survival sales levels the first year. Next, the  eight-step solution to survival sales suggests that forecasters (1) survey the competition, (2) research potential suppliers, (3) compute the gross profit, (4) estimate the firm's annual operating (or ongoing) expenses, (5) compute the estimated gross profit, (6) forecast the survival sales level, (7) derive the cost of goods sold, and (8) complete a formula (provided) in which operating expenses and net income (expressed in percentage of sales) are figured by dividing operating expenses (in dollars) by sales dollars and then subtracting that percentage figure from gross profit percentage.

        "author":["Hannay, Lynne M."],
        "description":"This examination of the reproduction of cultural norms focuses on ways in which the hidden curriculum facilitates cultural reproduction. The conceptual framework outlined in this paper emerged from a five-month observation study of a tenth-grade social studies class located in a predominantly working-class school. During the on-going data analysis, it became apparent that the evidence could not be forced into existing theories of cultural reproduction and a conceptual framework was developed to explain how cultural reproduction operated in the studied context. An analogy of a spider's web is used to depict the reflexive nature of cultural reproduction, with an inner web of normalcy symbolizing things perpetuated by the hidden curriculum such as acceptance of power, authority,  social stratification, and the work ethic, and an outer web symbolizing the constructs and myths (i.e., The American Dream), derived from surrounding society. In an examination of the inner web, school sources creating the fibers of the web are identified as the overt curriculum, social milieu, and interaction patterns. Next, student perceptions of the &quot;American Dream&quot; are explored. In the last section, the concept of fair exchange is advanced as the mediating component between the implicit contradiction of the acceptance theme of the inner web and the more egalitarian notions of the outer web.

        "description":"Based on the game &quot;Prisoners' Dilemma,&quot; a game-theoretical model of the arms race suitable for postsecondary level mathematics and/or political science students is developed in which two players can initially choose any level of arms development. The purpose of the game is to show under what conditions deescalation rather than escalation is a rational response to the burdens that an unrestricted arms race imposes on both sides. The strategic problem that the players face is to choose both an initial level of action (with an associated escalation probability) and a subsequent level of response (with an associated retaliation probability). The higher the level of arming, the greater the probability that the choice will be viewed as escalatory. A matrix representation and the rules  of the game are provided in the text which also explains the payoffs, strategic choices, and their interpretations. Quantitative, sequential choices define the game, which contains an Escalation Equilibrium analogous to the non-cooperative outcome in &quot;Prisoners' Dilemma,&quot; The game also contains a Deescalation Equilibrium, which is analogous to the cooperative outcome in &quot;Prisoners' Dilemma,&quot; except that it is stable. Separate sections provide an introduction, a description of &quot;Prisoners' Dilemma&quot; in relation to the superpower arms race, a discussion of the Deescalation Game and suggestions for rational play, and conclusions. An appendix presenting the details of the game's analysis and calculations of the players maximum strategies and values concludes the paper. (LH)",

Fourteen lessons follow  a discussion about the infusion of citizenship/law-related education, the conceptual basis of LRE lessons, the value of developing critical thinking skills, and basic principles and assumptions underlying LRE. Each lesson includes an overview, objectives, time requirements, materials needed, and procedures. Student handouts are provided where appropriate.

Three independent samples of undergraduate students in 22 speech classes at a predominantly black university were drawn before, during, and immediately after the November general election. Self-administered questionnaires recorded student assessments of Jackson, his campaigning organization, the breadth of his appeal, and his treatment in the press. Credibility was measured as an additive index composed of assessments of honesty, intelligence, experience, articulateness, and knowledge of foreign affairs. Primary factors examined as sources of variance in perceptions were newspaper reading,  television viewing, interest in politics, involvement in the Jackson campaign, sex, and grade level. Involvement in the campaign was the most important contribution to variance in all three sample periods. Media use is seen to influence perceptions primarily through its influence on interest and participation, although television news viewing maintained an independent path to credibility in the pre- and mid-primary samples.

Next, Leon Schur summarizes the key concepts and principles that are fundamental and most appropriate in the K-12 curriculum. In Part II, Mark C. Schug and Beverly Jeanne Armento discuss research on how children think about economic ideas as a basis for numerous teaching activities for elementary children. Ronald A. Banaszak then notes the importance of economic understanding for early adolescents  and presents appropriate learning activities. Similarly, Judith Brenneke and John C. Soper discuss the role of economics education at the high school, offering specific teaching suggestions. In Part III, Robert B. Woyach challenges teachers with a rationale for global education and offers practical teaching suggestions that introduce young people to the interdependence of our economy and the global economic system. Then Steven Haessler and Mark C. Schug identify practical ways to enhance citizenship knowledge and skills by studying the economy and the local community. In the final section, Margaret A. Laughlin introduces numerous resources to help improve economic understanding of both teachers and students. (LH)",

This paper focuses on conceptualizing strategies for the clinical application of Stages of Concern as a means to understand, conceptualize, and address the concerns of teachers as they implement a new innovation. More specifically, it focuses on a problem that change facilitators report is paramount--addressing the personal concerns of practitioners. It is pointed out that the curriculum change literature has a relatively strong base of sociologically-oriented strategies when psychologically-oriented strategies are needed as a complement,  especially for addressing personal concerns. The psychological literature on decision making and efficacy has not been utilized to any great extent and offers real prospect for helping address the personal concerns of teachers about implementing an innovation. Several specific concepts from the work of Janis (1976) and Bandura (1977; 1982) are presented and several practical uses of their ideas are illustrated. (JD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of sport sociology within American and Canadian Colleges and Universities. The study investigated: (1) the number of graduate and undergraduate courses offered in sport sociology; (2) current research area(s) of interest within sport sociology; (3) current text used as reference and topics discussed within the sport sociology course(s); and (4) career placement of sport sociology students. One hundred members (1981-82) of the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport were randomly selected to participate in this study. A total response of 54 surveys were returned--47 from the United States and 7 from Canada. The results indicated that American and Canadian colleges and universities are continuing to offer  required or elective undergraduate and graduate courses in sport sociology. These courses have been offered for almost seven years. Consistent topics covered within the sport sociology courses were: sport socialization, race and sport, and politics and sport. Current research is being conducted in the areas of socialization, women and sexism, and small groups. (Author)",

        "description":"In order to accommodate both the formal and informal curriculum and to best satisfy the philosophy of a school district, the development of educational specifications is prerequisite to the process of designing a school facility. Educational specifications consist of a series of interrelated statements that describe the physical requirements of the program which are later translated into the physical plant. Included within these specifications are clear and precise descriptions of learning activities to be housed in the school, their spacial requirements, special features of the areas to be included, and the relationship of these learning areas to one another. This paper presents a description of a series of workshps designed to acquaint teachers with the paradigms of educational  specifications with the aim of preparing them to participate with an architect in designing a school facility.

The University of Missouri-Kansas City conducted the 2-week program in conjunction with the Kansas City School District and resource persons in the community to better prepare high school athletes for the adjustments that must be made for a successful transition to university level athletics. A variety of themes and topics in the curriculum were selected to help students prepare for a career in college and thereafter. Curriculum components included: athletic injuries and treatment methodologies; community commitment; diagnostic  assessment in reading; ethics; interviewing; leadership; nutrition; parental concerns; recruiting; self awareness/stress; study skills; substance abuse; test taking skills; and future considerations. Appropriate cooperation between a university, a school district, and other community institutions and resources can help high school athletes prepare for a successful transition. (CB)",

This effective, practical, and inexpensive model entails the awareness of the physiology of stress, perception of tangible bases of motivation for children, appropriate and simplified techniques, applicability to other areas, and full recognition of the position, function, and implementation of relaxation skills. The model's formula has four factors--awareness, benefits, change, and dependency--which result in relaxation. Qualified personnel, who are sensitive and aware of individual needs and community demands and requirements, should administer or supervise the program. School officials and teachers must work closely and carefully with the parents of children in the program. Through the  Matthews Stress Management formula, students can gain confidence, acquire poise, and shape aggressiveness to positive ends, conquer anxiety and timidity, and enjoy new feelings of worth and wellness.

Teacher competency is a complex issue that is inaccurately confused with or identified as measures derived from academic testing. The problems in addressing the validity of teacher competencies are located in the very definitions of validity. Items used for measurement will never represent a fair and universal sample of teaching skills. Many skills found in effective teachers are not measurable. Current data on the use of achievement tests for predictability or assessment of concurrent skills is not favorable. The interpretation of standards to explain or provide direction can never be achieved if the  content to be measured is unclear. The public is deceiving itself by believing that current methods of assessing teachers are a measurement of teacher competency. (CB)",

An evaluation is presented of circumstances that help or hinder collaboration between colleges of education and schools in improving staff development and teachers' work conditions. A number of college of education and school district procedures are cited that currently hamper growth in the collaboration procedure. Among suggestions for improvement is a strong plea for redistribution and reassignment of the missions and responsibilities of schools and colleges of education. It is pointed out that there are difficulties in collaborative action when  professors in schools of education maintain an aloofness which effectively isolates them from the &quot;hands-on&quot; experience of teachers in schools.

The third goal is accomplished through two collaborative networks made up of statewide field centers and four teacher education centers serving student teachers.

        "description":"A case is made for maintaining teacher education at the undergraduate level. This paper outlines the core arguments used by contemporary proponents of extended teacher preparation programs, and identifies which of these arguments are recurrent themes from earlier rationales. The validity of the arguments is also assessed. Some of the hidden costs of mandating extended teacher preparation programs as the sole approach to the preparation of teachers are identified and evaluated. It is argued that the key issue is improving the quality of teacher education, and that this may be done within four-year, as well as extended, teacher preparation programs. The issue of whether four year or extended programs are best for teacher preparation will remain for many years; both structures  should be possible and effective. (CB)",

However, the gap between males and females narrowed, particularly in visualization. In the absence of a clear explanation, the report attributes the general decline  primarily to less student attrition in 1980 and the differential decline to convergence in the experiences of males and females.

One hundred thirty-three middle class subjects were studied from early infancy through adulthood, as part of the New York Longitudinal Study. Luis M. Laosa's paper, \"Temperament, Performance, and Culture: Dimensions of Early Behavioral Style in Chicano Families,\" reports on a study of 100 Chicano children. Mothers rated temperament when their children were 2 1/2, 3, 3 1/2, and 4 years old. Mood/manageability and rhymicity/responsivity were the resulting components. Michael Pullis's research, described in \"Temperament  and Behavior Disorders: Teachers' Perceptions of Student Control,\" asked elementary and secondary teachers to rate 224 emotionally disturbed students' temperament and self-control. Results suggested that teachers' perceptions of students' self-control and socioeconomic status influenced their teaching styles. \"An Analysis of Individual Differences in Student Temperament Characteristics and the Implications for Classroom Processes and Outcomes,\" by Lizanne DeStefano, Margaret C. Wang, and Edmund W. Gordon describes the instructional implications of student personality characteristics. Subjects ranged from age 4 to 9.

This model not only captures the effects on observed and unobserved characteristics of high school on earnings, but also can control for selection bias resulting from correlation between school quality and student ability. The principal data used to estimate this model comes from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. The sample for the analysis was restricted to out-of-school white males and females who lived in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. The findings suggest that such a model has a large impact on estimates of school quality and, as a result, on the policy conclusions that are drawn on the basis of such  evidence. This report first describes a general model of the effects of school quality and outlines the conditions required to obtain consistent parameter estimates. Second, it points out the problems of previous work in conforming to these conditions. Third, it describes the approach used to estimate school quality. Finally, it presents empirical results. (PN)",

These strategies include: (1) using existing statewide communication networks; (2) employing the Basic Skills Test (BST) as the major data collection instrument; (3) identifying each student's skill deficiencies through the Student Profile Sheets; and (4) determining the impact of the program on students who are promoted through the Compensatory Education Tests. The evaluation results for the program were reported through the use of a modular format. The evaluation report drew primarily on data from the 1982, 1983, and 1984 administrations of the BST to provide  longitudinal information concerning the effects of the program on student performance. As a result of this evaluation, two recommendations were made. The data supported the program on identified deficit skills but suggested that this focus be broadened to address additional skills prerequisite to the next grade level BST. Secondly, school systems were urged to consider carefully the decision to promote students who fail to attain the minimum performance standard on a specific BST; retention at the earliest level at which deficiencies are identified was strongly recommended.

The first two data sets were derived from large normative samples of responses to a multidimensional self-concept instrument and to a multidimensional instrument used to assess students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness. In the third set, data were simulated and generated according to the model to be tested. In the fourth, data were simulated and generated according to a three-factor model that did not have a simple structure. Twelve fit indicators were used to assess goodness-of-fit in all CFAs. All analyses were conducted with the LISREL V package. One-way ANOVAs and a visual inspection of graphs were used to assess the sample size  effect on each index for the four data sets. Despite the inconsistency of the findings with previous claims, the results are consistent with the observation that the amount of random, unexplained variance varies inversely with sample size.

Chapters 2 and 3 explain the resulting impact on math concepts/applications and reading comprehension respectively. Chapter 4 examines the degree of adjustment to school as  reflected in peer acceptance, attendance pattern, student turnover or transiency, and achievement. Chapter 5 attempts to clarify some of the strategies (with their attendant difficulties) used by students in processing information and solving problems. The final chapter shows how this project can contribute to the solution of some of the school district's problems and charts new directions for educational improvement.

        "description":"Research was conducted investigating properties of skill in learning, in the domain of elementary algebra. Thinking-aloud protocols indicate that early knowledge of the subjects studied was fragmentary, rather than involving systematically flawed procedures. Computational models, developed to simulate observed errors, focused on the role of structural representations in facilitating reliable performance. Connectionist models for recognizing structural features were investigated, leading to the conclusion that the cognitive system probably requires knowledge functionally equivalent to grammatical rules. Data from information processing experiments indicated that: (1) judgments about the application of an algebraic operator are influenced by low-level features recognized before a  completely parsed representation is formed; and (2) recognition of individual characters in expressions is not facilitated by syntactically correct contexts, as it is by lexical contexts in letter recognition, but information about the algebraic categories of characters is obtained early in processing from the syntactic context. The conclusion is made that training in basic symbolic skill might be more effective if more attention were given to teaching the structure of information of the domain, including general features of the information presented in problems as well as general constraints and goals of the procedures to be acquired.

Florida, Tennessee and Virginia accepted and worked with SREB and NAEP staff to develop and administer the testing program. Administered in April 1985, the project findings provided the participating states with a current and reliable measure of how their students' reading achievement compares with national and regional results, and for the first time they have comparable data on how their students' achievement compares with students' achievement in other states. A summary of score comparisons of the reading assessment are provided for eleventh grade students  in the nation and in the NAEP Southeastern region (excluding the SREB states of Maryland, Oklahoma and Texas). The national and regional averages include students in public and private schools, while the participating SREB states included only public school students. The state comparisons are made to the national and regional testing administered in Spring 1984. The SREB/NAEP project also included a &quot;background and attitudes&quot; survey of students which is available from the individual states. (PN)",

This model was used for the evaluation of a Certificate in Industrial Relations program in a Quebec French university. This study focused on two main objectives: first, the local utility of the program being assessed, along with the major problems encountered by the administrators; and second, identifying the advantages and limits of the model by comparing them to those reported in the literature. Regarding the first objective, the rich, detailed and pertinent information enabled the evaluator to sketch out a portrait of the situation. The evaluation results and findings were transformed into specific recommendations to improve the program. Concerning the second objective, several  advantages and limits cited in the literature were confirmed and new ones were found. Specific recommendations on the use of the responsive model included: (1) use of an evaluation contract; (2) disseminate information as to the evaluation process and product; (3) involve a specialist to corroborate data; and (4) use constant feedback as an essential condition not only to responsive evaluation but also to all evaluative approaches.

        "description":"The traditional explanation for dual-task interference is that tasks compete for scarce processing resources. Another possible explanation is that the outcome of the processing required for one task conflicts with the processing required for the other task. To explore the contribution of outcome conflict to task interference, this paper describes two experiments with college undergraduates that manipulate the relatedness of tasks. Experiment 1 found that the difficulty of the individual tasks is not the only determinant of how much they will interfere when combined, and that there must be substantial interactions between processes carrying out the two tasks. Experiment 2 found that although between-category search was more efficient than within-category search in single tasks, it  was less efficient in dual tasks. There appears to be significant task interactions due to the confusability emerging when the nontargets of one task belong to the same category as the targets of the concurrent task. In addition, the congruence of target presence or absence on the two channels was found to have a sizeable effect. Four potential sources of outcome conflict are discussed. (Author/PN)",

The second application was in describing general influences on change in a study of high schools. The checklist was designed to provide a means of looking at school situations, individually or comparatively, for evaluating and planning for change. It was intended to indicate the way context influences a particular aspect of the setting, and to provide a means of quantifying and comparing what would otherwise be qualitative data. The  interaction of factors was also considered. Results indicated that factors promoting faculty use of microcomputers were overall access, space, staffing, and training. Problems involved insufficient access, software, and lack of ideas for applications. Data from the High School Study were currently being processed. It was concluded that the benefits of the checklist supported further exploration. (One blank checklist, as well as one completed by one of the colleges, are appended.) (GDC)",

The SAS measures teachers' perceptions on nine organizational dimensions and combines the results to produce an overall school portrait. The focus of the first model is on collecting data quickly with little attention given to how the information might be used. This model has the advantage of being inexpensive and easy to implement, but the risk is high that the resultant data will not be used. In the second model, additional training is offered to help educators move beyond analysis to consider changes in their schools. The advantage is that it  gets people together to address school issues, but its weakness is often lack of any long-term commitment to a targetted improvement effort. In the third model, careful thought is given to where the organization should go and why. The advantage is that the effort is often a key priority for the school. Its disadvantage is the continual struggle to maintain the effort and to have it become part of the value system of the school. (PN)",

The rationale for this criterion-based model is drawn from the fields of the assessment of student writing, criterion-referenced testing, and the assessment of second language oral proficiency. Four charactertistics important for evaluation were identified from an analysis of published evaluation guidelines: (1) pedagogical content; (2) instructional presentation; (3) documentation; and (4) technical adequacy. Data are presented on the  mean ratings of software evaluated with the model, scale intercorrelations, and indicators of its validity and reliability.

This report summarizes the findings from a cross-validation study of CAST that used the following procedure. Prospects' CAST scores were recorded by recruiters in the United States Army recruiting stations and were subsequently matched by social security number to applicant tapes from Military Entrance Processing Stations to obtain AFQT scores and relevant demographic data. These data were  examined using regression, discriminant function, and cross-tabulation analyses to provide recruiters with information on how to interpret prospects' CAST scores. The correlation between CAST scores and AFQT scores was .80 for the cross-validation sample, whereas in the initial validation sample the correlation was .85.

Maximum likelihood estimates for pooled samples of fraternal pairs from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study where both brothers were interviewed (532 pairs) and where only one brother was interviewed (N=928) were obtained. No evidence was found that the effects of family background lead to bias in the effect of mental ability on schooling or in the effects of schooling on occupational status or earnings.  These findings are confirmed by a reanalysis of another set of data on 346 fraternal pairs from Kalamazoo, Michigan. Family background was found to have a large independent effect on ability, schooling, and, to a lesser degree, socioeconomic attainment. Although the models used are simple, it is felt that they provide a useful framework for the development of more complete models and comparative analyses of family effects on offspring who differ in sex, age, or ability.

A survey of 1,384 households of Vietnamese, Sino-Vietnamese, and Lao refugees who arrived in the United States after October 1978 was conducted. Interviews were held in the Fall of 1982 in five sites: Boston, Chicago, Houston, Seattle, and Orange County, California. It was found that Southeast Asian refugees have made steady progress in climbing out of dependency on transfer income and increasing their standard of living in relation to the official poverty level and that there is every indication that they will continue to  progress in a positive direction. Virtually all the refugees studied relied on cash assistance at the beginning of their stay; dependency is apparently not by choice. Factors that were found to be important in the families' levels of self-sufficiency were household size and composition, the refugee community as a source of support, and participation in and effectiveness of English language programs and employment service programs.

This study was initiated because of the increase of single female heads of household and the general trend towards a feminization of poverty. The report offers the following findings: (1) Most women on AFDC wish to be self-sufficient but face obstacles such as inadequate day care, poor education and training, and poor employment  opportunities. (2) Many States have initiated experimental programs to assist AFDC recipients to find a way out of poverty. Maine's Welfare, Employment, Education, and Training Program (WEET) and Maryland's Employment Initiatives (EI) program are discussed as successful examples. Some other programs coordinate welfare employment programs with State economic development policy or encourage self-employment as an option.

The &quot;Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981&quot; provides for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize grants to States to assist eligible households to meet the costs of home energy, up to the amount of $2,140,000,000 for 1985 and $2,275,000,000 for 1986. The purpose of the &quot;Native American Programs Act of 1974&quot; is to promote economic and social self-sufficiency for American Indians, Hawaiian Natives, and Alaskan Natives, with financial appropriations as may be needed for the fiscal years 1979 through 1986. The &quot;Head Start Act&quot; extends the authority for appropriating funds for Project Head Start's delivery of comprehensive health, education, nutrition, social,  and other services to economically disadvantaged children and their families. The &quot;Follow Through Act&quot; authorizes the Secretary of Education to provide financial assistance in the form of grants to local educational agencies for the purpose of carrying out Follow Through programs focused on children from low-income families in kindergarten and primary school, with an authorization of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1985 and $7,500,000 for fiscal year 1986. The &quot;Community Services Block Grant Act&quot; authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States to ameliorate the causes of poverty in communities within the State, with authorized appropriations of $400,000,000 for fiscal year 1985 and $415,000,000 for fiscal year 1986.

        "author":["Vazquez, Jesse M."],
        "description":"This conference paper presents the \"ethnic matrix,\" a theoretical model of the process of ethnicity which describes how ethnic identity is sustained or diminished in the life of an individual or ethnic group. After a general introduction, the first of the paper's three major sections presents a research review and overview of historical and societal perspectives of ethnic identity. It argues that, as a response to the cultural preservation revolution of blacks and Hispanic Americans of the 1960's, social scientists attempted to become more sensitive to the complexities of culture. Yet much remains to be understood about the form and function of the acculturation and assimilation process: it can no longer be simply assumed that individuals within a particular ethnic group will  ultimately move from immigrant to assimilated Americans. The paper's second section presents the ethnic matrix model. A continuum is said to exist between two opposite poles: complete maintenance and complete assimilation. The individual fluctuates between these poles, and an individual's ethnic orientation is ultimately defined by daily choices, not by a fixed ethnic identity. The final section describes the nature of ethnic choices, and introduces a vertical component to the model, the intensity of the choice's impact on identity. The paper concludes by discussing some of the implications of the model for the social sciences. (KH)",

        "description":"This booklet considers the problems of urban unemployment and presents 21 case studies of urban areas dealing with the problem. The first chapter defines urban unemployment and classifies barriers to employment, trends in unemployment, and types of unemployed persons. Chapter 2 describes some general principles necessary to successfully combat the problem on the local level. There are two major considerations which make a program successful: (1) differentiating the groups needing help, i.e., disadvantaged youth, hard to employ adults, and dislocated workers; and within these groups identifying the problem specific to where they live and work; and (2) specifically tailoring the programs to meet the needs identified above. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 present the case studies, subdivided  according to the particular group served (disadvantaged youth, hard to employ adults, dislocated workers). Each case study is presented in a summarized form and a contact person is listed at the end of each. The sources of initiative for the variety of programs surveyed include local elected officials (responsible for nine of the 21), private industry (responsible for six), community based organizations (responsible for five), and foundations (responsible for one).

        "description":"This report describes and evaluates the initial effects of the 1984 Texas Education Reform Bill (House Bill 72), in which the Texas legislature enacted a massive attempt to enhance both equity and effectiveness in the State's system of elementary and secondary education. Chapter 1 describes the Bill's various financing components and focuses on its initial effect on disparities in spending among rich and poor districts. Chapter 2 examines the various reforms aimed at improving the quality of teaching, and Chapter 3 focuses on the provisions that affect students. Chapters 4-7 deal with the effects of House Bill 72 on programs which seek to provide special educational services (compensatory education, bilingual education, special education, and vocational education). Chapter 8  describes the implementation of new prekindergarten and summer preschool programs. Chapter 9 discusses the difficulty of implementing curriculum reforms at the State and local levels, and focuses on the confusion that has resulted from House Bill 72's requirements and those of a 1981 law, House Bill 246, which called for different types of reform. Finally, Chapter 10 presents general conclusions and recommendations. The study uncovered widespread satisfaction with the general direction of reform, it is said, except in certain areas where implementation of the law has been difficult. The State, it is argued, must be willing to accept that education is likely to be more expensive in the future. (KH)",

First, the history of the educational uses of a variety of media (film, radio, television, teaching machines, and videodisc systems) is traced and assessed. As instructional aids, it is said, the media economize teachers' time and efforts, impart information efficiently, and can make learning more fun, but research has strongly suggested that the effectiveness of media is largely dependent on the abilities of a good teacher who uses them effectively. Next, the report describes current and emerging applications of the new computer-based technologies, including: (1) management of curriculum content; (2) management of pupil information; (3) presentation and  monitoring of drill and practice; and (4) computer-assisted tutorial instruction. Following this discussion, an overview of research on the effectiveness of computers in instruction, and particularly in compensatory education, is presented. Next, difficulties in evaluating cost-effectiveness and feasibility of computer-based instruction are described. Finally, findings on the possible uses of computers in attaining educational equity are discussed. Striking inequities are said to exist between the affluent and the poor; differentials in access to equipment, program quality, and the usages of computers are reported. (KH)",

The report is divided into two main sections, the first of which describes the population at risk; motivations, choices, and consequences of teenage pregnancy and motherhood; adolescent fathers; and pregnant and parenting teenagers' expressed needs for services. Section 2 presents an overview of what is being done for pregnant and parenting adolescents. In general, it is said, the existing programs address only a portion of the problems of pregnant teenagers identified in the research. First, because the attraction of parenting is inversely proportionate to the possibility of other options, dropout rates must be lowered and  jobs should be created for out-of-school youth. Second, counseling courses in psychology and family life could help adolescents resolve the ambivalences between autonomy and childhood dependency. Third, because teenagers have unrealistic fantasies about what having a child will imply, they must be helped to understand the responsibilities involved. Fourth, because parents usually play an important role in teens' pregnancy resolution decisions, programs must be created to draw in the mothers and fathers of pregnant teenagers. Finally, programs need to involve the teenage father directly and to help enhance his capacity for immediate and long-term caring. (KH)",

The study methodology included a review of literature about the Hmong; in-depth case studies of seven Hmong resettlements across the nation; discussions with informants in over 40 other Hmong communities; and interviews with national Hmong leaders and spokespeople. The report is divided into four major sections. The first presents an overview of the Hmong, including their traditional lifestyle and economy, the impact of the 1954-75 wars, experiences in Thai refugee camps after 1975, and resettlement in other countries. Section II examines the settlement patterns of Hmong in the United States, and discusses factors influencing where Hmong were  initially placed and why many have continued to migrate within the country. Section III focuses on how the ongoing Hmong resettlement appears to be faring and identifies some problems and solutions (including economic adjustment, English acquisition, education of children, and groups with special needs). Finally, section IV presents a summary and recommendations. Four appendices include: brief case study site descriptions; community informants' estimates of Hmong community characteristics; estimated statistics on Hmong population and public assistance rates in the United States; and a transcript of a group meeting with Hmong high school students.

The summary is organized within the framework of three major questions: (1) what has been the resettlement experience of the Homng? (2) what resettlement efforts and economic strategies have provided effective results for the Hmong? and (3) how might current strategies be changed to result in more effective resettlement and long-term adjustment of the Hmong? Among the most important findings of the study is the variability of Hmong resettlement in different locales. It is generally concluded that economic prospects are most favorable for school-aged Hmong, for whom assimilation is much  easier. The report emphasizes findings relating to secondary migration, the movement of Hmong away from their initial resettlement site. Other issues discussed include: (1) how Hmong are faring in terms of employment, dependence, and adjustment; (2) the areas of employment in which Hmong have been particularly successful; (3) impediments to effective resettlement; (4) problem-solving approaches; (5) external and internal regulation and public policies affecting the Hmong; (6) economic development and employment projects; and (7) the Hmong's concerns for their future lives.

Section II gives information on the size and history of the Hmong population who, according to one source, numbered  approximately 10,000 in May, 1983. Section III considers a variety of resettlement issues, including lack of English proficiency, lack of job skills, discrimination, welfare dependence, lack of job search skills, and the lack of entrepreneurial experience and technical assistance for farmers and small businessmen. Also discussed are education issues, in particular the feelings of extreme disorientation the Hmong feel in the schools and their sense that the education is inappropriate for their needs.

Section I gives general information about Portland, its population, economy, employment market, welfare, housing, refugee services, and the mixed community reaction to Hmong refugees. Section II gives brief information on the size and history of the Hmong population in Portland, which was approximately 1,068 in 1983. Section III discusses employment and education issues. Section IV discusses the unique significance of Portland as a site in  that it experienced an emigration of Hmong which reduced the refugee population by three-fourths. The section also summarizes the site findings, which include: (1) secondary migration from Oregon to California has significantly affected the Portland Hmong community; (2) the Hmong desire economic self-sufficiency and feel that public assistance should be tied to employment; (3) despite a poor economy, many families have at least one employed member; (4) the Hmong feel they have not benefited from employment services and mostly have found jobs through community networks; (5) there are few vocational or job training opportunities and they feel that ESL should be closely tied to job training; and (6) high school students have difficulty graduating and are not receiving adequate vocational  training.

Section V discusses the future of the Hmong in Minneapolis-St. Paul, their goals, likelihood of secondary migration, and possibility of repartriation. In general, the mood of the Hmong community in the Twin Cities is one of frustration and depression. (CG)",

In section IV summaries of the site specific findings are given, along with reflections on the future of the Hmong in Providence. Some of these findings are as follows: (1) housing is inexpensive either for rental or purchase; (2) there are a large number of entry level jobs in the jewelry and metal industries which, while low paying, give the Hmong jobs and often provide health insurance benefits; (3) the Hmong community is recognized and funding is available for them throughout the state; (4) employers are increasingly receptive to refugees; (5) health centers with bilingual staff are available; (6) there is an undercurrent of racial tension, and segregated housing patterns limit the Hmong to high crime neighborhoods. In general, the outlook for  the Hmong in Providence is seen as relatively positive with the expectation that they will reduce their welfare dependency rate below the average for United States' citizens.

Witnesses addressed concerns about the program's allegedly unspent funds and the proposed funding cuts. Testimony was heard from William E. Brock, Secretary of Labor, and Raymond Flynn, Mayor of Boston, Massachusetts, among others. Secretary Brock addressed the issue of JTPA funding allocated to the states, the proposed budget for fiscal year 1986, State and Federal coordination of the program, implementation of civil rights compliance mechanisms, recordkeeping requirements of the program, and achievements in targeting service groups. Mayor Flynn's statement addressed the successes of the program and spoke for the maintenance of funding,  particularly in relationship to the needs of urban areas. Gary Orfield, from the University of Chicago, summarized the findings of a study about JTPA in Illinois, which found that there has been an enormous shrinkage of training resources throughout the state and that there were serious problems of equal opportunity at every level of the training system. Other testimony addressed the issues of the Federal role in the program, expenditure constraints and reports, and the general effectiveness of the program.

The director of Public Sector Programs, Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission, submitted an extensive statement on his agency's tracking of and reporting formats for affirmative action goals. Testimony was then heard from various representatives of the agencies not in compliance, explaining and justifying their positions.

Following an executive summary and other materials, the report is divided into eight sections. Section I describes TAP and the study context and methodology. Section II presents background characteristics of TAPs at the national level for all TAP counties nationwide and at the provider agency level for those providers in the site-visit sample. Section III discusses the outcomes of TAP at both levels. Section IV, the most extensive portion of the report, examines the relation of major context and program factors to TAP  outcomes. Descriptions of how TAPs actually operate and how these operations appear to be related to their success in attaining TAP goals are presented. Section V discusses the quality of TAP outcomes. Section VI focuses on programs, primarily economic development and cooperatives, which cannot be readily assessed by the criteria used for the majority of TAPs. Section VII describes some innovative program features noticed during the site visits. Finally, section VII presents a summary discussion of conclusions and implications for refugee program policy and implementation. The report concludes that the TAPs are meeting most of their goals at a respectable, if slightly slow, pace. Three appendices include the evaluation plan abstract, definitions of program types, and a list of the  provider sample. (KH)",

        "description":"The employment alternatives available to disabled workers in various countries throughout the world were compared. Using a six-level model in which level 1 designated no employment and level 6 indicated competitive employment with no accommodation or shelter, the researchers examined the following employment practices: competitive employment (involving quota systems, government grants and tax credits to employers, and/or government subsidies); fully integrated employment (including supported employment and affirmative action); semi-integrated employment; and segregated employment. The use and relative effectiveness of each of these strategies both in the United States and abroad were compared. It was concluded that despite the well-documented failure of sheltered workshops in  helping disabled workers become \"job ready,\" they have been widely used in the United States as transitional places of employment. A more effective strategy would be to structure sheltered workshops to provide permanent employment for disabled workers so that these workers could be engaged in meaningful employment, interact with nondisabled co-workers, earn competitive wages, and receive fringe benefits equivalent to those in private industry. Significant national policy changes would be required if competitive and fully integrated employment for disabled workers were promoted through a quota-levy system, government grants and wage subsidies, and supported work programs. Five pages of references conclude the report. (MN)",

It was determined that more funds are being obligated for supportive services than for program improvement and that the percentage of funds allocated for research, exemplary and innovative, and curriculum development projects has continued to decrease. Collectively, the States are obligating more than 51 percent of their program improvement funding to curriculum development. The amount obligated for each project varied considerably, with the actual range extending from $1,491 to $875,262. In FY 1985 State  program improvement projects were being conducted by educational agencies and institutions at every level. Teachers and coordinators were the primary users of 58 percent of the products and services yielded by the projects. State program improvement projects have focused on every educational level, with the greatest number addressing improvement of instruction.

The specific objectives of the project were as follows: update the issues, barriers, and incentives involved in employing retired military personnel to fill teaching positions in civilian vocational education, develop a model for providing military personnel with counseling related to vocational education teaching as a second career, and provide recommendations for increasing the employment of retired military personnel in civilian vocational teaching positions. Data from communication with the military and vocational communities were assimilated into a brochure and an information profile that will be developed into camera-ready form for distribution to military  personnel who have already decided to retire and who are in need of counseling about the steps they must take to become vocational education teachers. In addition, recommendations concerning ways of increasing the vocational education community's awareness of military retirees as a potential source of teachers and specific recruitment strategies were formulated.

It focuses on some of the basic questions associated with program evaluation. (For example, what purpose does program evaluation serve? What are the major program evaluation models used? In what ways, if any, is program evaluation in adult education different from the evaluation of other types of programs?) In general, the journal articles selected were those abstracted in the Current Index to Journals in Education between 1981 and 1985. Books were selected to represent fairly what is currently available in the field; most have been published in the last 10 years. The guides and workbooks selected for  review include a wide selection of how-to evaluation manuals, ranging from fairly simple to complex. The paper has been divided into four major sections. The first section provides an overview of the major purposes for doing a program evaluation in adult education. Section II includes a brief description of four selected evaluation models that appear to be particularly applicable to adult education programs. The third section provides a critique of five commercially published \"how-to-do-an-evaluation\" packages and guides that can be applied to postsecondary adult education. The final section consists of an analytical summary in tabular form of books and guides pertaining to program evaluation and an annotated bibliography of selected journal articles and books that covers the professional  literature for the past five years.

        "description":"This paper addresses the issue of whether four of the learning styles instruments currently available are of sufficient psychometric quality to warrant their continued use either for research or educational purposes. Four instruments, which purport to measure learning styles, were selected for review. Criteria for selection were based in part on the frequency of references in the professional literature and discussions with several adult educators who have had considerable experience with the assessment of learning styles. The four instruments chosen were the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, Canfield's Learning Styles Inventory, and Gregorc's Style Delineator. The paper is divided into six sections. Following the first section, which introduces the  study, each of the next four sections consists of a detailed critique of the four learning styles instruments selected for review. Each critique follows the same format and includes a description of (1) the practical features of the test, administration, scoring, and other considerations; (2) characteristics of the manual, including how information is reported and what test interpretation information is provided; (3) characteristics of the test including norms, reliability, validity, and its overall quality; and (4) a summary statement that focuses on the reviewer's personal decision regarding the use of the test. The paper closes with a listing of research questions that need to be explored and some suggestions for improving the measurement of learning styles. (KC)",

The analysis was limited to degree-seeking students at least 35 years of age. Nearly three-fourths of the survey respondents were between 25 and 34 years of age. After age 35, women were much more likely to enroll in a college degree program than were men. Most attended school part-time and had attended a college or technical school prior to their current period of enrollment. Family and job responsibilities were the most frequently cited reasons for delaying the completion of a degree. The reasons for delaying college work varied with age. A significant  majority returned to college to improve their job and career opportunities. Adults in the 35 or older category were less likely than the younger adult students to cite \"develop a new career\" as a goal. While events that trigger an adult to enroll in degree programs were very diverse, circumstances related to job or family account for a significant majority of the reasons cited for returning to school.

Most first jobs were low paying with difficult working hours and few benefits. Many participants had one or two jobs that had not worked out. During the first year on the job, displaced homemakers commonly felt very insecure. Self-esteem and self-confidence were practically non-existent at point of program entry. Self-assessment, personal skill  building, and study of employability skills were effective as combined in Job Seeking Skills for Displaced Homemakers classes. The project indicated that the class would be more effective if expanded to include communication skills, self-image building, etc. The emotional support and encouragement supplied through interactions of students in the classes and in other program activities is vital in establishing self-confidence.

        "description":"Organized labor's relationship to vocational education has always been one of wholehearted support and encouragement. Since the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act in 1917, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) has supported state efforts to develop vocational education. Labor has strongly supported apprenticeship programs that included cooperative relationships among the schools, employers, unions, and equipment manufacturers. Recognizing the dependence of vocational education upon its relationships with organized labor, the American Vocational Association created its Labor-Management Relations Committee in 1954. Since that time, various unions have worked to improve vocational education dealing with their particular trade, and the AFL-CIO has vigorously opposed proposed cutbacks  in funding for vocational education. Historically, the AFL-CIO has urged that vocational education students receive a comprehensive education with emphasis on basic skills education rather than on a program that is too job specific. Despite labor's continued support of vocational education, the incorporation of instructional materials dealing with labor into vocational programs is the exception rather than the rule. Continued strengthening of the partnership between vocational education and organized labor is vital in light of the current need to retool and to retrain the work force in the United States, and government leadership is essential to achieve this goal.

        "description":"The current demand for educational excellence is an outgrowth of recent national reports criticizing secondary education. This push for academic excellence also affects vocational education outcomes. A growing consensus seems to be emerging that at the secondary level (1) vocational education should be integrated with academic education, (2) technical skills should focus on transferability, (3) employability skills are important, and (4) basic communication, computation, and problem-solving skills need reinforcement in occupational preparation. Principles derived from effective schooling research, successful business practices, and school improvement policy studies can help improve vocational education. Effective schooling studies have identified six critical factors with the  greatest potential for application to vocational education settings: time on task, expectations of performance, student motivation, cooperative learning, effective learning climate, and the use of evaluation. The eight successful business practices described by Peters and Waterman in &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; are also relevant to vocational education: a bias for action, close to the customer, autonomy and entrepreneurship, productivity through people, hands on--value driven, stick to the knitting, simple form--lean staff, and simultaneous loose-tight properties. Finally, school improvement policy studies focusing on the co-management of the school by the school and the district show that district support can be a key factor in improving vocational education. A seven-page bibliography is  included. (SK)",

        "description":"Career decision making in Taiwan was examined in the context of a society undergoing dynamic change as modern entrepreneurial values are accommodated in a cherished traditional culture. Especially during the past 20 years, the economy of Taiwan has changed from agriculture to technology. At the same time, the educational needs of students have changed as more educated workers are needed to develop the technology for the new society. The focus of guidance counselors in Taiwan, however, has traditionally been on helping students to prepare for the examinations that take place after ninth grade and allow students who pass to go to college. Until recently, little attention has been paid to students who do not pass the examinations and thus do not qualify for college education. Few  efforts have been made to acquaint these students with jobs for which they could prepare outside agriculture. As a result of this study, recommendations were made on the following topics: rationale for guidance, model of career decision making, individual assessment, development of occupational information, linkages between individual characteristics and occupational attributes, strategy and algorithm for career decision making, testing, and counselor preparation.

        "description":"The Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania summarized efforts in adult basic education (ABE) for the period of July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1985, based upon information provided for every program funded under the Adult Education Act of 1966, as amended October 19, 1984. The information showed that from 1983-84 to 1984-85, progress was made in increasing the availability of programs throughout the state and in decreasing program dropouts. Demographic characteristics this year were similar to past years for the 25,373 students who received 12 or more program contact hours. The student population continued to be young, single, and nearly equally divided between males and females. Although most of the participants were white, the proportion of minority group  members was larger than in the target population. Students most often indicated that obtaining a diploma was the reason they were participating. Students most often found out about the program through friends, by word of mouth, and by the news media, and less often through referrals from human service agencies. During the year, staff members increased by 8.4 percent from the previous year, although the increase represents greater use of volunteers. The ratio of students to staff dropped from 14:1 to 12:1. In general, the cooperation with other agencies, efforts to increase enrollments and retention, special efforts to serve special target groups, infusion of adult competency curricula into the programs, and diversity of special projects suggest that the Pennsylvania adult basic education  program administrators are committed to, and are making progress toward, achieving the goals of the Adult Education State Plan. Appendices include: (1) survey instruments; (2) Statistical Section of the Federal Adult Education Annual Performance and Evaluation Report; (3) Pennsylvania ABE Program Summary by County; and (4) a list of Section 10 Funded Projects.

        "description":"In this study, a theoretical model of profit maximization was developed in which the Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) is treated as a wage premium payable to military personnel who are more productive, more costly to recruit and train, and less likely to continue in the Army in the absence of the SRB. Empirical estimation of the model is based on measuring the productivity of service personnel (in terms of their civilian counterparts' occupational wage), recruitment and training costs, and separation rates. Multiple regression equations are used to estimate civilian wages (a proxy for productivity) as a function of civilian occupation, education, and age of the worker. The empirical model groups Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) into three categories--combat arms,  technical, and support services. The results for military personnel in grade E-4 reveal that the average SRB calculated by the model ($5,247) should be about the same as the actual payments ($5,297) for service personnel in combat arms, but should be higher ($7,308) compared to the actual ($5,312) for technical occupations, and lower ($1,942) compared to the actual ($3,757) payments in the support services. The research shows that retention rates in technical MOS can be raised by increasing the SRB. The required increase in SRB expenditures can be funded by reducing SRB payments in the support services.

        "description":"Crop production in 1984, particularly for spring-planted crops, returned to near-normal levels from the much reduced output of 1983 when government programs curbed planted acreage and drought depressed yields. The top five states in net farm income were California, at $3.5 billion; Iowa, $2.2 billion; Florida, $1.8 billion; and Illinois, $1.7 billion. Top earners among commodities were cattle and calves and dairy products. Texas led cattle-and-calf production with $4.5 billion, and Wisconsin led dairy earnings with $3 billion. Iowa led in receipts of the next three highest earning commodities: soybeans, $2 billion; corn, $2.1 billion; and hogs, $2.6 billion. (This report details a state-by-state financial ranking of the U.S. farm sector in 1984. The report is one of five in the&quot;Economic Indicators of the Farm Section&quot; series. In the report, data are reported at the state level for farm income and balance sheet accounts, including and excluding farm households. One major feature is the separation of the operator's household and dwelling from farm production transactions, assets, and debt. All of the income estimates in this report are based on a calendar year. The data, while mainly based on information from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Statistical Reporting Service and the Census of Agriculture, also include information from other government agencies and private sources.

          "Wells, Sherril"],
        "description":"A regional approach to offering vocational education in Douglas County, Oregon, had been discussed for many years. In 1984, a feasibility study was conducted to determine whether such a regional approach would be possible in the county and to establish vocational programs determined as high priority in the feasibility study. Through discussions with consultants, high school principals, and community college officials, and observation of programs in other states, the feasibility study was completed and the results reported in December, 1984. Some of the findings of the study are the following: (1) 15 miles is the maximum distance for students to travel to vocational classes; (2) students must be provided with transportation for maximum participation; (3) the use of the community  college for instruction of junior and seniors is a highly feasible option; (4) the quality of instruction can be enhanced by sharing instructors among schools; (5) mobile vans are a feasible solution to the sharing of high-technology, high-cost equipment in specialized areas such as office equipment and electronics; (6) a mini-magnet skills center has great potential as a sharing system; and (7) changes must be made in current methods of providing vocational education in order to satisfy business and industry. Since the feasibility study indicated that regional vocational programs could become a reality in Douglas County, two pilot programs were set up and began to function. A north county program provided for the inclusion of word processing equipment and software at four high schools.  In a south county program, hardware and software were purchased for an electronics class to be offered in 1985-86 at three high schools. Recommendations were made to continue studying and implementing shared regional vocational education programs in Douglas County. Appendices include the feasibility report, written by Burr Fancher in cooperation with the Oregon Alliance for Program Improvement and including survey instruments; and summaries of the north and south county proposals.

The report of the study contains 12 chapters. After a brief look at the context of office automation from the perspective of history, the first chapter highlights some expectations about the technologies and their development over the next 15 years. It also introduces a framework that guides the assessment, summarizes the findings, and identifies policy issues for the next decade. Chapters 2 through 6 discuss the possible effects of office automation in more detail. They deal with potential effects on employment levels; the kind of training and education needed for office work; changes in work content, jobs, occupations, and organizations;  the quality of work life, the office environment and labor management relations; and the security and confidentiality of information. Chapters 7 and 8 consider two alternatives to conventional offices, made feasible by office automation: home-based work and performance of data-entry operations in countries with lower paid workers. Chapter 9 and 10 look at office automation in the public sector, while Chapter 11 deals with office automation and small businesses. The final chapter considers the implications of office automation for two groups: working women and minorities. Appendix A describes office automation technology as it is now and as it is likely to develop between 1985 and 2000, while Appendix B summarizes case studies of the automation of several offices.

Analysis of 310 project information submitted by states came to the following conclusions, among others: (1) staff development is the highest priority for 310 projects, nationally (32 percent of document funds); (2) employability projects show a dramatic decrease in support compared to last year; (3) &quot;other&quot; organizations receive the largest amount of funds; (4) many projects gave no data to information-gathering efforts; (5) the funding of adoptions and adaptions of previously developed innovations continues, although the validity of the claims of innovation is not known; (6) the average cost of 310 projects is  $22,000; (7) more than 100 projects are funded at $5,000 or less, and an additional 84 received no more than $10,000; (8) little attention is being paid to dissemination of project results, perhaps because of underfunding. (This paper contains a summary of the 310 projects by geographic areas, types of organizations involved, and subjects of projects.) (KC)",

It also provides resources for serving adolescent parents. Statistical background is presented first. Consequences associated with adolescent parenthood are then discussed, including less education, reduced employment opportunities, increased risk of divorce and poverty, psychosocial consequences, effects on the young mother's family, consequences for the young father, implications for the children of adolescent parents, and costs to society. Lists are also provided of personal and environmental obstacles to labor market participation by adolescent parents. A history of services to  adolescent parents covers national as well as state and local efforts. The following section identifies some resources at federal, state, and local levels that have been tapped to provide assistance to programs for adolescent parents. A catalog of innovative programs for adolescent parents contains abstracts describing comprehensive programs for adolescent parents, all of which encourage employability development. Strategies for improving service delivery to adolescent parents are then suggested. An appendix contains descriptions of federal programs that may be accessed to provide services to adolescent parents. (YLB)",

The study used a multiple regression, pooled cross-section/time-series model over the 1975-1982 period, including pay, unemployment, educational benefits, and recruiting resources as independent variables. For high-quality enlistees, defined as those with test scores in the top half of the population or top-scoring individuals who are also high school graduates, a 10 percent increase in military pay raised the supply of enlistees by roughly 10 percent. A 10 percent increase in the unemployment rate (e.g., from 7 to 7.7 percent) increased the number of high-quality enlistees by about 6 percent. Recruiting resources had the expected effects.  Army recruiters increased and other services' recruiters reduced Army enlistments. Advertising (both national and local) did not have consistently positive effects. Results were similar for high school graduates, except that the effect of military compensation depended crucially on how it was measured. Estimates of the supply of enlistees of all qualities were weaker still: estimates of compensation effects varied widely, and estimated effects of recruiters and advertising were less plausible. Unemployment effects were smaller than for high-quality recruits but hardly negligible. (YLB)",

The SEM model is described as involving two processes, the reflection process and the comparison process. Relationships among the three variables are hypothesized, such as the raising of one's own self-evaluation by the good performance of another person close to one's self. Experimental research is discussed which provides support for the hypotheses that when relevance is high the comparison process is more important than the reflection process and that when relevance is low the reflection process is more  important than the comparison process. Findings of research on siblings are presented which also give supporting evidence for the model. The implications of this research to psychologists--which involve pro-social behavior, interpersonal relationships, and unit formation--are discussed. The predictions that the SEM model provides for relationships are discussed and the role of affect/emotion in the working of these processes is explored.

Of the respondents, 64 percent were male, 53 percent were married, 68 percent had some college education, 24 percent had graduated from high school only, 82 percent were Caucasian, 41 percent were Republicans, 40 percent were Democrats, and 54 percent had a family income between $20,000 and $50,000. Fourteen items on the questionnaire measured attitudes; 23 items measured knowledge. Knowledge questions included items such as the number of nations with nuclear weapons and if the United  States nuclear warning systems have ever malfunctioned. Attitude questions included items such as agreement with a nuclear freeze and with spending money on &quot;Star Wars&quot; research. When controlled for education, income, and age, correlations between knowledge and attitudes revealed that voters with more knowledge were significantly more likely to support a nuclear freeze, oppose building more missiles, and oppose funding &quot;Star Wars&quot; research.

The 367 adjectives were selected by methods designed to eliminate any researcher bias. Participants (N=683) were men and women from an introductory psychology class. Stereotypic judgments were obtained by having two groups of men and two groups of women, with 50 subjects in each of the two groups, rate the extent to which a characteristic described a typical male or female today on an 11-pont scale. Self-characterizations were obtained by having 69 men and 84 women describe  themselves on the same scale. Ratings of desirability characteristic of the typical male, female, and self were made independently. Men and women had high agreement concerning the attributes of typical males and females with a correlation of .76. Differentiating characteristics were identified. The results do not support traditional findings of the lesser desirability of the feminine stereotype compared to the masculine stereotype. The single factor which explained 83.3 percent of the total variance conflicts with results from earlier studies. (ABL)",

A study was conducted to investigate the negative aspects of social relations which parallel two positive components of social relations, esteem support and affirmative support. If social support represents the positive aspects of interpersonal relationships, social conflict represents the negative. Social support and social conflict were measured in relation to stress in 675 outpatient pharmacy users, about one-half of whom had filled a prescription for Valium within the previous six months. (The effects of Valium use on stress and well-being were of interest to the researchers whose longitudinal data were used in this study.) Although not intended to be representative of American adults, the subjects'  distributions of sex, age, and education were similar to those for American adults. Participants were interviewed on four different occasions in their homes with questions about stress, life quality, social support, social conflict, positive and negative affect, self-esteem, physical health, performance at work and home, and medication use. The results indicated that social support and social conflict were not correlated. Positive and negative aspects of social relations did appear to be independent of each other. Social support was found to relate strongly to positive outcomes while social conflict related strongly to negative outcomes. (ABL)",

Participants were patients from a large group pediatric practice. Mothers (N=56) of patients completed the Parenting Stress Index. Twelve months after completion of the Parenting Stress Index, subjects were assessed using the: (1) General Health Rating, which measured subjects' perception of their health status; (2) Medical Utilization for the Child, which gave frequency counts from the child's medical chart; (3) Mother's Health Care Seeking Behaviors, which measured the mother's report of her use of medical services; (4) Mother's Illness-Related Behaviors, which consisted of mother's monthly mean report of days in bed, non-prescription medicines used,  etcetera; and (5) Traumatic Injuries, which gave frequency counts from child's medical charts. The results showed that maternal level of parenting stress appeared unrelated to obtaining medical services for young children. Inappropriate medical utilizaiton rates based on maternal stress did not occur for very young children. Maternal level of parenting stress was related to high rates of maternal use of medical services, illness-related behaviors, and maternal perceptions of health status. Low and moderate stress levels were not related to illness behaviors. Parenting stress was not shown to be related to traumatic injuries of the children, possibly due to the young age of this group of children, who were 12-24 months old when the observations were made. The Parenting Stress Index may be  used in identifying parents under excessive stress who may later exhibit illness behavior. (ABL)",

A 1985 investigation of the graduation rate of the 1979 freshman class of San Juan High School was conducted which also sought to identify logistical problems with the collection of data needed for determining the graduation rate. Dropout research has been complicated by lack of a uniform definition of dropouts and a uniform method of estimating the dropout rate. Attrition rates overlook details about where, when, and why students dropout. San Juan High School was chosen because its student body composition resembled state averages in background and achievement and the school had a stable population and educational programs.  Records were checked to determine which students who had entered as freshman did not graduate with their class. Efforts were made to locate these students and to determine their status. Logistical problems in tracking the students included the variability of record keeping and transferring, student name changes, undocumented address changes, and legal constraints on the release of student information. The overall graduation rate was found to be 76.9 percent although only 59.1 percent graduated from San Juan High in January or June of 1983. Sixty-nine students who had dropped out earned their diplomas or passed a proficiency test at a later time. The actual dropout rate was 22.6 percent. The freshman grade point averages of those who later dropped out were lower than those who subsequently  graduated. (ABL)",

        "description":"Although studies indicate that as many as 22 percent of women have been raped, few of these women seek help immediately after the rape. Most rape victims experience a postrape distress response which may not be resolved for some victims. Long-term symptom patterns include fear/avoidance responses, affective constriction, disturbances of self-esteem/self-efficacy, and sexual dysfunction. The understanding of long-range psychological problems is complicated by temporal distance between trauma and aftereffects, the interaction of trauma with the victim's coping process, and life changes. Because of culturally supported myths about rape such as the woman bearing responsibility for the rape, a victim is more likely to accommodate the rape than to resolve it. Most treatment studies  have focused on only the first year postrape. A stress inoculation treatment package for nonrecent rape victims who are demonstrating phobic fears has been developed which includes didactic, coping skills, cognitive, and facing fears components. Procedures for treatment of nonrecent rape victims include assessing spontaneous rape resolution; building a relationship with the client; addressing resistance; and fostering rape resolution through discussion of painful feelings, involvement of the social network, promotion of cognitive re-appraisal, restoration of self-efficacy, and treatment of target symptoms. Refinement in conceptual models of rape impact and resolution is needed. (ABL)",

        "description":"Rape is believed to be one of the most underreported crimes with 3 to 10 rapes committed for every one that is reported. Rape represents an extreme behavior which can be placed on a continuum of sexual aggression defined by degrees of coercion and force. The prevalence of sexual aggression among college students nationally was examined in 3,187 female and 2,872 male college students enrolled in 32 colleges chosen for their national diversity. A self-reporting questionnaire was administered in classes which included questions on demographics, sexual experiences before and after age 14, family and social history, current behavior, and psychological characteristics. The results indicated that 15.4 percent of college women reported experiencing legal rape and 4.4 percent of college  men reported perpetrating legal rape. An additional 12.1 percent of women reported having experienced attempted rape and 3.3 percent of men reported having attempted to rape someone. Virtually none of these crimes were reported and thus represent \"hidden rape\" not reflected in crime statistics. Men did not admit to the levels of sexual aggression that women reported. Few women reported the crime or sought victim assistance. Rates of sexual victimizaton/aggression were robust and did not vary with school size, type of institution, location, or population size. Future research should investigate conditions which lead to this violence. (ABL)",

        "description":"Recent reserach has attempted to determine systematically how attitudes influence behavior. This research examined whether access to attitude-relevant beliefs and prior experiences would mediate the relation between attitudes and behavior. Subjects were 49 college students with a mean age of 27 who did not live with their parents or in dormitories. Subjects' opinions toward preservation of the environment and their recall of preservation-related beliefs and experiences were assessed during the first experimental session. Approximately two weeks later, subjects were contacted at home by a different experimenter and were asked to sign and circulate proenvironment petitions and to participate in a recycling project. Subjects' responses to the petition request and the number of weeks  they recycled were assessed. The results indicated that both favorability toward the environment and access to attitude-relevant information were important predictors of behavior. The exact nature of the relation between these predictors and behavior was apparent in the subsample of subjects who agreed to recycle: subjects with relatively high levels of access were likely to act in a manner consistent with their opinions; those in favor of preservation recycled, signed, and agreed to circulate the petitions, whereas those less favorable toward preservation were not as likely to do so. Subjects with relatively little access appeared to base their actions on factors other than their opinions. (Author/NRB)",

Recent research which has demonstrated declines in cognitive functioning with age has involved episodic memory and rehearsal-independent forms of such memory. It is not known how much of this decline can be attributed to physiological, sociocultural, or experiential factors. Continuing, if not increasing, productivity with aging occurs in performance areas requiring expertise such as mathematics or the arts. Tasks that do not require expertise, such as finger tapping, are often used in psychological research. Expertise tasks tend not to be measured in developmental research. Some research has shown paradoxical results  for functional skills tests. Although older people were slower at component skills of a task, they were equal in overall task performance. This suggests limitation in the kind of measurement commonly used in cognitive research. It is not known whether expert performance is maintained by compensatory strategies or whether the present componential analysis is incorrect. (ABL)",

        "description":"The relationship between altruistic behavior and popularity found in young children becomes much less defined with older children. In a paired-comparison procedure, 144 children from two elementary schools ranked the relative attractiveness as a potential friend of four fictional children described as altruistic, prosocial-aggressive, good at sports, or group-oriented. The sociometric status of the children on these variables was also assessed, in addition to liking measures. The results revealed marked sex and grade differences both in the rankings and in the correlations of the sociometric measures. In general, both boys and girls ranked the altruistic child highest and the group-oriented child a close second, with the prosocial-aggressive and good-at-sports child considerably  lower. However, the sociometric data revealed a much different picture of how these variables could predict actual liking among this sample, especially among the older children. While all variables were significantly correlated with liking in the third grade sample, only group orientation and being protective of friends predicted liking in sixth grade boys, and only being good at sports predicted liking for sixth grade girls. Most importantly, the correlations between altruism and liking declined significantly in the older children such that altruism bore no relationship to social acceptance nor to any of the remaining sociometric variables. These results are consistent with recent research showing that altruistic behavior may have a questionable status among preadolescents (especially  boys). (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"When presented with linguistic material, elderly adults are often unable to report as much material as are younger people. To ascertain whether elderly adults are as sensitive as young adults to the underlying structure of the to-be-remembered sentences, a study was conducted using the item recognition priming technique. In this technique, people attempt to remember sentences containing unassociated nouns. The subjects are asked to decide whether or not individual words occurred in the studied sentence. Thirty-six young (18-25 years) and 36 elderly (64-82 years) subjects were tested with a series of 288 item recognition trials consisting of 144 occurring nouns and 144 distractor nouns. When the primed trials were compared with the control trials, a significant and prime effect  was found for young and elderly people with no significant differences between the age groups. The differences on paired-recognition of the nouns, a more traditional measure of memory, were significant with young subjects being correct for 83 percent of the trials and elderly subjects being correct for 72 percent of the trials. Elderly persons appeared to be less sensitive to the underlying propositional structure of the sentence than were younger subjects. Younger people showed more within-proposition than between-proposition priming, whereas the elderly subjects did not. Using tests of memory without awareness may give a more complete measure of memory across the lifespan than do traditional measures. (ABL)",

        "description":"Cognitive factors have been shown to play an important role in marital distress. To examine the importance of the self-other distinction for understanding the impact of attributions on marital satisfaction, two studies were conducted. In the first study, causal attributions for naturally occurring behavior by the self and spouse were investigated in 44 married couples, including both distressed and nondistressed spouses. Subjects completed a Spouse Observation Checklist, reporting on specified behaviors of their spouses over a 24-hour period. It was found that both self-enhancing and spouse- enhancing attributions were related to greater marital satisfaction. In addition, nondistressed spouses were more willing to see themselves as the cause of their partners' negative behavior  than were distressed spouses. In the second study, causal and responsibility attributions for hypothetical behaviors by both the self and spouse were investigated in 76 distressed and nondistressed spouses. The results of the first study were replicated and extended, showing that self attributions accounted for variance in marital satisfaction which is independent of that due to attributions for partner behavior. Self- other attribution differences varied as a function of marital distress. Nondistressed spouses showed a positive attribution bias by making more benign attributions for partner versus self behaviors whereas distressed spouses showed a negative attribution bias, making less benign attributions for partner than self behavior. These findings suggest that self attributions may,  in part, determine the impact of attributions for spouse behavior on marital satisfaction. A six-page list of references concludes the document.

Theme or plot is needed to unify the discrete events. A meaningful story is derived from a diversity of incidents. Narrative links individual actions into an overall theme. A practicing psychologist must approach a client from an integrative perspective. The psychologist assumes the client has made choices and can make future choices in order to change his life. People experience their selves in terms of a temporal concept, articulated in a narrative scheme. The practicing psychologist may find  scientific methods limited in the help they can provide. The discipline of psychology needs to include the narrative format as a tool for practicing psychologists. (ABL)",

A study was conducted, based on a previous study by Hurlburt, Lech, and Saltman, in which subjects were randomly interrupted to rate their thoughts and moods on a Likert-type scale. Thought samples were collected from 27 subjects who carried random-tone generators continuously for 3 days as they moved through their routine daily environments. Subjects interrupted their ongoing activity to record their experiences of thought and mood each time they heard the sampling apparatus tone. Between 80 and 150 thought rating vectors with measurements on 42 cognition and mood variables were produced by each subject. The series of rating vectors were submitted to 27 P-type factor analyses and compared  to factor patterns produced by groups in the earlier study. Six stable factors similar to the group results (Aggressive/Bad Mood, Pleasant/Sexual, Clear Thought, Daydreaming/Past Sexual, Duration, Self-Critical) appeared in at least 20 of the 27 P-type analyses, despite vast differences in the sample collection environmental conditions. These findings provide evidence that individuals produce factors similar to those produced by groups. This analysis illustrates the idiosyncratic thought characteristics of individuals that are the basis for generalized factor patterns. There are, of course, unique differences among individuals which reflect varied personalities. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Emotional dependency is a healthy and adaptive aspect of human development. Differences exist in how this dependency is labeled for men and for women. Women are socialized to attract men as life partners and achieve through their affiliation with others, not to be competent and ambitious on their own. Women have been expected to subordinate themselves to men in physical and intellectual tasks. Women and men participate in relationships which protect the men's egos from women's competence. Women's emotional needs are often not met in their relationships with men; in the past, women's emotional needs have been met through friendships with other women. Men's emotional dependency is discussed under the concept of power. Men feel a need for validation through sexual relations with  women, resulting in what they perceive to be women's power over them. Men feel that women gain power over them by women's ability to bring out men's positive and negative emotions. Perceived loss of power over self motivates men to seek to have power over women. An example of how slowly social patterns change is the high rate of sexual intimacy between therapists and clients. In the past, the professional viewed this unethical behavior as the woman client's fault because of her sexual power. Therapists themselves are trapped by their own socialization. Research needs to examine further the role of male dependency. (ABL)",

        "description":"It has been suggested that older workers may be particuarly vulnerable to the obsolescence process. One definition of obsolescence directly implies that the obsolescence construct is a function of two elements, the job and the person. New technologies, new products, and new methods and procedures can result in job changes which in turn can compel changes in worker requirements. Workers may engage in updating behaviors to maintain their evolving jobs. Organizational, job, individual, and motivational factors may all work to affect these updating behaviors and person changes. The few studies that exist on the topic of age and obsolescence suggest that older workers tend to be more prone to obsolescence than do younger workers. This finding may be due to motivational elements in  contrast to ability differentials between age cohorts. If age differences in obsolescence are due to motivational factors, there are several organizational interventions which might be helpful: (1) insure that updating and skill acquisition opportunities are available to employees; (2) inform workers of expected job requirement changes; (3) help to minimize risk factors in updating; (4) help to maximize rewards for skill acquisition; and (5) view skill acquisition from a long-term perspective. If these strategies are followed, age-obsolesence relationships due to motivational factors might be reduced or eliminated. (NRB)",

Type A behavior has been associated with the prevalence, recurrence, and future incidence of coronary heart disease. The attributions and achievement-relevant cognitions of 50 Type A and Type B male undergraduates, in response to success and failure, were assessed using a method for studying Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations. Subjects listened to two tapes and then verbalized their thoughts. One tape dealt with the subject imagining himself in an academic failure situation, the other in an academic success situation. The Jenkins Activity Survey was used to classify subjects as Type A or Type B. While  expected A-B differences in self talk were not revealed, a pattern of relationships emerged for Type A's between causal attributions for success and failure and positive success expectancies. Significant positive correlations wre observed, for Type A's, between the frequencies of effort attribution for failure and positive success expectancies. Attributions to task difficulty and chance factors were negatively correlated with frequency of emission of positive success expectancies in response to failure. With regard to the success situation, frequencies of ability attributions and positive success expectancies were highly correlated. Analyses of the self talk of Type B's showed no relationships between these cognitions, suggesting that the mediating role of causal attribution may be of  greater significance for Type A's than for Type B's.

Women may be more sensitive to the ill effects of their environment than are men. A conducive environment for women would recognize intimacy, responsibility for  others, and the quality of relationships. Campus organizations would emphasize open, dynamic structures rather than hierarchial ones. Rules would fit the individual and process would revolve around the ability to care for others.

        "description":"Organizational socialization is the process by which a person learns the values, norms, and required behaviors that allow an individual to function as a member of an organization. The individual has expectations of job content, job context, and career expectations. Reality shock occurs when a newcomer's expectations differ from experiences in the organization. The hypothesis that reality shock negatively influences organizational commitment and commitment-related behaviors was tested in a longitudinal field study conducted at a large accounting firm. Subjects (N=162) were new accountants. A questionnaire was administered on the first day of employment to assess pre-employment expectations. A second questionnaire measuring perceptions was administered one year later. The  accountants reported significant levels of reality shock. Results supported the hypothesis that the extent of reality shock experienced does impact the employee's organizational commitment, attitudes, intentions, and behavior. Correlations between reality shock measures and organizational commitment measures were negative. The results also indicated that older newly-hired accountants were more committed than were younger accountants, and those from blue collar families were more committed than were those from upper class, professional families.

Internal-external control reactions to a persuasive message and the recall of the message were examined in two studies. In the first study, 35 undergraduate students' locus of control was measured using Duttweiler's Internal Control Measure. On the basis of this measurement, subjects were classified as having an internal or external locus of control. Subjects then received either an advertisement with high or moderate credibility. Subjects' manipulation, a measure of message acceptance and behavioral intentions, was measured. The results showed that externally-oriented people were more responsive to advertisements than were internally-oriented consumers. In the second study, 114  undergraduates were again classified as having internal or external locus of control and then received highly or moderately credible advertisements. Organized and unorganized product listings were used in which product features were either grouped or not grouped. The personality trait of locus of control was not found to affect message acceptance or behavioral intentions, but it was found to affect the amount learned. These results emphasize the importance of recall and persuasion when evaluating advertising. (ABL)",

        "description":"Traditional theories of career development and career choice have been useful for the typical middle class male. Career counselors must improvise, however, when serving clients who are less advantaged, minorities, handicapped, unemployed adults, or women. A model of career choice for women and men developed by Helen Astin focuses on the need to look beyond the status quo and to explore not only training and employment issues, but also issues in various support systems: financial aid, employment policies relevant to women and minorities, childcare options, and changing social norms with respect to family and work roles. Astin's model calls attention to a wide range of opportunities relevant to career choice. Different components in career development theory are relevant for  different age groups and different individuals. These components need to be identified, empirically verified, and routinely addressed in career counseling. Researchers must begin to identify key constructs within the structure of opportunity for different age groups and individuals and to provide evidence of the relative strength of the influence of these constructs on socialization, work expectations, and work behavior. This will require longitudinal studies with subjects of various ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Counselors must begin to incorporate some of these considerations into their career counseling practices. (NRB)",

Consequently, the staff member is sometimes not aware of what caused a person's success or failure. In order to give constructive feedback to an employee, a supervisor or another colleague could observe the staff member at meetings, in group counseling sessions, or in advising sessions. The goal of such observations would be to help staff improve listening, speaking, questioning, interpersonal, and organizational skills. Observation has been previously used in faculty development. This process can be adapted for professional staff by using voluntary participation by staff who, after training, would become consultants for each other. In a sample process, an  observer takes non-evaluative notes on a meeting which include content, process, questions asked, responses from staff, and who talked. Follow-up discussions between observer and observed are then held. Observer consultants could be training during a workshop which explains the qualities of an effective worker, defines the helping relationship, and teaches observation techniques. (ABL)",

Subjects (N=162) were presented with two lists of learning material, one with meaningful material and the other with meaningless material. Lists were presented acoustically and visually. Subjects were asked for recall; recall rates were used as dependent measures. Problem-solving was measured by ordered concept-forming tasks involving prediction. Subjects were from seven age groups (8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 40, and 60 year olds). The results revealed that up to age 20, subjects showed an  increase in recall rates and that older subjects showed a decline. Lower-order concepts were more often formed than higher-order concepts for all age groups.

        "description":"Although the mental health field tends to underestimate the father's role in the psychological development of the child, eating disordered women reveal a consistent pattern of paternal distance and disengagement that is fundamental to their developmental problems. To examine how the father's emotional and/or physical absence contributed to the development of eating disorders, interviews were conducted with 39 females between the ages of 9 and 23 who presented with primary anorexia nervosa. Thirty-six of the 39 subjects characterized their fathers as emotionally disengaged and believed that this distant relationship was a significant factor contributing to their illnesses. Sixteen subjects reported that their fathers had been involved during their early years and that through  illness, alcoholism, or divorce, became distant. The symptoms of eating disorders may function to help the young woman regain her father's support and attention. Therapists can use various methods to engage the disengaged father. A case presentation of one anorexic and the therapist's inclusion of the family, specifically the father, in treatment illustrates the effectiveness of this approach. The anorexic's appreciation of her father's role in her treatment can be a powerful therapeutic tool. Implications of these findings include the involvement of the entire family in the treatment of eating disordered patients, with special emphasis on the impact of the father's distance or disengagement on the family. Theoretically, a new appreciation of the father's role in female psychological  development is needed. (Author/NB)",

Of 55 other countries on which statistics were available, lesbianism was legal in 18 countries. The prevailing view on lesbianism by mental health professionals today seems to be one of cautious acceptance. Mental health professionals need to understand the issues which are vital to the lesbian experience. Most lesbians are single; mental health statistics reveal that being single is psychologically &quot;healthier&quot; for women than being married. Research comparing lesbians and heterosexual women has not found consistent differences in mental health, with the exception of higher self-esteem for lesbians. Lesbianism involves a process of &quot;coming  out&quot; and most lesbians are in their 20s before they begin having lesbian relationships. Lesbians usually have fewer and more long-term relationships than gay men. For lesbian couples, there is a large emphasis on emotional closeness, love, and security. Compared with heterosexual women, lesbians are less likely to be in sexually monogamous relationships and are more likely to have personal autonomy. Several issues confront lesbian mothers that are not concerns for heterosexual parents. Hopefully, an understanding of these issues will help to decrease homophobic stereotypes about lesbians and will demonstrate how the lesbian experience can serve as an affirmative model of a nontraditional lifestyle.

In addition, the research shows that metaphor comprehension starts during the preschool years, is originally limited to a few metaphorical expressions that occur in  predictable linguistic and situational contexts, and develops rapidly to encompass a greater variety of metaphorical domains as children's knowledge and information processing abilities increase. Finally, the literature suggests that child metaphors are a reflection on the language of an underlying transfer of knowledge from one conceptual domain to another, similar to the transfer of knowledge that occurs in adults.

The goal of the project is to create an interdisciplinary sequence of courses in critical skills that will function on an advanced work station that is capable of running up to 20 different processes at once. During the remaining two years of this project, it will be necessary to learn and then incorporate within the curriculum knowledge about the expert, the uninstructed student, and the instructed or developing student. Since it will be difficult to translate this knowledge, combined with three curriculum concepts (what a  teacher teaches, what experts do, and what students do) into actual practice, the translation must be made by building up stories teachers tell, stories students tell, and stories put into the curriculum.

Subjects--167 first graders--were asked to read four stories, two of which were taken from basal readers and two of which were children's trade books. One trade book and one basal story each had illustrations that were crucial to story comprehension, and one of each had nonessential, or redundant, illustrations. The stories were presented to each child in one of four versions: text only, illustrations only, text plus illustrations, and revised text. After the students read the story aloud, they were given an oral comprehension test and asked to  read a list of five words taken from the story. Decoding errors and reading time were recorded. Results showed that first graders who read poorly answered comprehension questions better when the texts they read were illustrated, and about equally well regardless of whether the illustrations were redundant or crucial; good readers answered more questions correctly on texts that did not depend on crucial illustrations, regardless of whether or not the illustrations were actually present.

Among the findings are the following: (1) The majority of those involved in computer assisted instruction (CAI) did not have computers available in their classrooms; they either scheduled special classes in the computer lab or just required students to use computers outside of class. (2) Presence or absence of support facilities was rarely mentioned as a serious drawback. (3) Few teachers made use of computers at the planning stage in the writing process, while most of those who required computer use at all required it for the  production of the final draft. (4) Few teachers found the computer useful for teaching grammar. (5) Teachers are looking for more good software. (6) Advantages of CAI noted by the teachers were intangibles--atmosphere, motivation, paradigm shifts, and so on, while disadvantages centered around time and money. and (7) Problems with CAI are usually caused by apprehension on the part of teachers rather than students.

While the rule based assumption suggests that children typically pass through a three-phase acquisition process in which they first learn past tense by rote, then learn the past tense rule and overregularize, and then finally learn the exceptions to the rule, this paper argues that the acquisition data can be accounted for in more detail by dispensing with the assumption and substituting in its place a simple homogeneous learning procedure. The paper shows how \"rule-like\" behavior can emerge from the interactions among a network of units encoding the root form to past tense mapping. The paper concludes with the observation that a large computer  simulation of the learning process demonstrates the operating rules of this alternative account, shows how details of the acquisition process not captured by the rule account emerge, and makes predictions about other details of the acquisition process not yet observed. A description of a binding network for converting the computer representation to a phonological representation is appended. (Author/HOD)",

The skills are divided according to seven outcome goals expected of students by the end of grades 3, 5, 8 and 11: (1) ability to demonstrate the use of vocabulary, speech, numerals, and other symbol systems essential for effective communication, computation, and problem solving; (2) ability to interpret the literal meanings of information presented in written, visual and oral communication; (3) ability to interpret the implied meanings of information presented in written, oral, and visual communication; (4) ability to evaluate content and use of written, oral, aural, and visual communication; (5) ability to generate, organize, express, and evaluate ideas in oral  and written forms; (6) ability to use reasoning skills; and (7) ability to manage personal habits and attitudes, time, and instructional resources constructively in order to accomplish learning tasks. Under each of the goals are listed specific skills that identify learning outcomes needed as a basis for success in other learning tasks. (HOD)",

        "description":"In the spring of 1985, the Oregon Department of Education conducted an assessment of eighth graders' writing skills. It was the first statewide assessment to be scored analytically according to six traits: ideas and content, organization and development, style, word choice, syntax/sentence structure, and conventions (grammar, punctuation, spelling, usage, capitalization and paragraphing). After the tests were scored, an interpretive panel of teachers and curriculum specialists convened to draw conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses in student performance and to identify key issues for consideration in the future. Among their findings and recommendations are the following: (1) student performance was least acceptable on the traits of ideas and content, and organization and  development; (2) student performance on the other four traits was relatively more acceptable, though improvement is desirable; (3) careful consideration should be given to the prompts used in subsequent assessments; (4) information on ideas and available resources that can help teachers of writing should be provided; and (5) the scoring guide used to rate student papers for the assessment reflects strong parallels with the teaching of writing as a process. (Test results are included, as well as the analytical scoring guide.) (HOD)",

To help students become more experienced writers, QUILL includes two tools for writing: a planner, which helps students plan and organize their pieces, and a writer's assistant or text editor, which facilitates the revision process by making the addition, deletion, and rearrangement of text easier. QUILL also provides students with two contexts for writing. The first is an electronic mail system with which students can send messages to individuals, to groups, or to an electronic bulletin board. The second is an information management system in which writing is accessed by title, author, or keyboards. Observations from more  than 150 classrooms showed children could use QUILL for genuine communicative purposes if they were provided with the right opportunities. However, QUILL's effectiveness depended on the attitudes teachers conveyed to their students about it, and on the teachers' decisions about how students were allowed to use it. (Included are six lessons on how best to use QUILL that were created during two years of field-testing in second through eighth grade classrooms.) (HOD)",

For example, the courts have ruled that boards of education may remove books from school libraries on the grounds that those with the authority to place the books on the shelves in the first place have the authority to remove them. Lee Burress, who has studied censorship problems encountered by English teachers for over 20 years, reports the following figures: in 1966 just over 20% of high school librarians who responded to his survey reported some form of censorship pressure. By 1982, that percentage had climbed to 34. In light of these and  other disturbing figures, the National Council of Teachers of English has joined other professional organizations in forming a coalition, the Academic Freedom Group. In addition, the council encourages the efforts of its Committee against Censorship and has published such useful works as &quot;The Students' Right to Read&quot; and &quot;The Students' Right to Know.&quot; Freedom of speech is the &quot;most beautiful thing of the world&quot; and teachers must defend it at all costs.

One is to offer students a list of poetry standards that ask students to consider the poem's conciseness, clarity of thought, and imagery; the use of nouns and verbs, and of metaphors; the sound of words; the structure, tone, and control of the poem; and the reader. Other ways are to create a list of poets to work with and to read at least one book on the craft of creative writing. The teacher can also provide the student with a list of words not to use--overused nouns, overused or opinionated adjectives and adverbs, and assorted cliches--and offer students advice from famous writers, editors, and publishers. To avoid overwhelming the beginner, the teacher should start small, focusing on one  skill at a time and building upon it, while presenting models of good poetry. Finally, the teacher should encourage students to enter contests or to try publishing in a publication so they sense that they are writing for an audience other than the teacher. (HOD)",

The monograph first cites examples of three common mechanisms for censorship. It then analyzes the ways in which Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation of commercial and cable broadcasting differ, and how the courts view these two media differently with regard to pornography and First Amendment freedoms. The monograph then explores the question of whether cable television is legally analogous to film distribution, discusses  court cases that have served collectively to develop obscenity law as it applies to film--specifically the &quot;Roth&quot; test involving community standards and redeeming social value, and describes the comparatively few cases in the development of indecency-obscenity regulation of broadcasting. Finally, the monograph presents a rationale for a unique test for obscenity to be employed when dealing with adult cable television. (HTH)",

The traditional heuristics were the same as those used for the CAI programs and were presented as handouts with the appropriate directions.

Findings showed no  significant main effects in holistic quality for the type of heuristic used prior to the writing or for the mode of instruction. The results also showed no significant main effects in quantity of ideas for the type of heuristic used prior to the writing or for mode of instruction. However, there was a significant main effect for the type of heuristic used prior to the writing. Writers using the unsystematic heuristic--free writing followed by synthesis--used a greater percentage of the ideas produced by that heuristic. (HOD)",

Subjects, 160 engineers practicing in the Chattanooga, Tennessee region, completed a questionnaire concerning writing attitudes, including anxiety and confidence, and levels of productivity. Findings show that confident engineers produce significantly greater amounts of written work, that years of education and years of employment correlate positively with productivity, and that the engineers in the study rarely revise their first draft, preferring to make corrections as they move along.

Seventy-nine confederate/subject dyads were composed of randomly selected basic communication students, all of whom had completed a communication apprehension measure. Dyads were divided into situations with high and low potential for outside evaluation, and with a structured or unstructured task. Interactions were videotaped for eight minutes. Results indicated that communication performance was variably influenced by evaluation  potential and the amount of structure of the task. The communication of high CAs was disrupted by evaluation, but less so if task structure provided guidance. Low CAs were less debilitated by evaluation, but showed more behavioral disruption on a highly structured task.

Specifically, it argues that poor conversational recall is based not on excessive self-focus, but on type of orientation to conversational text and the interaction mode of the conversation.

The responsibility of securing competent judges can be met through a more extensive training program for each individual who will serve as a hired judge. A seminar conducted by the tournament director might include at the very least a discussion of the rules and, in the case of individual events, a review of each description. The specific ballot should be explained in detail, as well as the significance of each aspect. Rather than influence judges' personal judging philosophy, the fairest approach would be to present the  major viewpoints held in each area and then recommend that each judge determine his or her own standards. Also, providing judges with an opportunity to watch host school competitors perform the various events, coupled with a generalized critique by the tournament director, should provide a clearer understanding of the activity. Extreme care must be taken to ensure that hired judges who are familiar with host school competitors are kept out of rounds involving these students. Finally, coaches should provide validation to all ballots, whether from hired judges or not, so that students are made aware that the worth of each opinion and comment rests in the content, not in the author.

        "description":"In an effort to assess the communication skills of prospective teachers, a study examined the role of three pedagogical domains in speech communication instruction--skill, knowledge, and motivation. Fifty student teachers were tested using the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PCRA; McCroskey l977), the Communication Competency Assessment Instrument (CCAI), and the Snyder Speech Scale (SSS). Additional indications of skill level were taken from student records. The results of analyses showed that motivation for communication was not a differentiating factor in the success of student teachers, and that the student teacher's knowledge of content and teaching appears to be only slightly related to overall teaching assessment. The study concluded that the SSS, with its  focus on public speaking skills, might be a useful device to use in methods courses or seminars to examine lecturing skills prior student teaching. However, the CCAI, with its focus on interpersonal and listening skills, may reflect both skill and knowledge and might be more appropriate for use in a prospective teacher's college career to help identify weak areas for extra training. Likewise, the PRCA may indicate students who might benefit from instruction aimed at alleviating anxiety. (EL)",

        "description":"To account for how physical attractiveness or unattractiveness may have pervasive effects upon others' perceptions of an individual in a public speaking class, 26 male and 26 female speakers were rated by their classmates in terms of attractiveness and quality of speaking performance at the beginning and end of a ten-week quarter. In addition, their initial performance was tape recorded and evaluated by raters who did not observe their attractiveness. Results indicated that the initial biasing effects of attractiveness were not mitigated by information gained during the ten weeks of class in which the students became better acquainted with each other, saw each other repeatedly in public speaking situations, and received information designed to increase their insight and  objectivity about that situation. The speakers judged to be attractive maintained their advantage, and the relatively unattractive made no noticeable gains. Even when the evaluators only heard but did not see the speaker, the quality of the performance was judged in an associated manner. The results suggest that the judgments of attractiveness without sight of the speaker were produced by performance quality, although the mechanism was not clear. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study examined the effects of training in argumentation and of initial candidate preference on perceptions and evaluations of presidential candidate debates. Subjects, 490 undergraduate speech communication students, were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions--control (no training), criteria only, and criteria plus explanations for their application--just prior to viewing the debate. Subjects also completed a questionnaire on demographic information and candidate preference (Ronald Reagan, Walter Mondale, Other, and Undecided). Subjects then viewed the televised debate. Subjects' post-debate perceptions of the candidates were measured using two 35-item semantic differential scales and a single scale representing a global assessment of performance in the debate.  Finally each subject rank ordered ten performance-related criteria in terms of the importance of each to the subject's evaluations of the candidate. The most noticeable result centered on the uncommitted subjects' perceptions of the candidates. The effects of training on those who had an initial commitment to a candidate were more ambiguous. A statistically significant training/preference interaction effect was observed for the subject's perceptions of Reagan on both the &quot;capability&quot; and &quot;personableness&quot; dimensions. Uncommitted subjects who had viewed Reagan more negatively on the &quot;capability&quot; dimension as a result of training evaluated Mondale in just the opposite way. Those uncommitteds who were trained evaluated Reagan's performance less favorably than did those in the control group.  While these findings might suggest that only a portion of those exposed to training are influenced by it, the effect of such training can be significant in some elections. (HTH)",

        "description":"In an attempt to correlate effective school practices with actual observed student achievement, a survey instrument concerning principal leadership and school climate was distributed to classroom teachers in the Oklahoma City Public Schools. Responses by more than half of the teachers yielded 1,294 usable questionnaires representing all 94 schools in the district. The analyses in this paper focus on factor analysis of the 78-item teacher survey data after aggregation to the school level. Constructs represent mean principal ratings and within-school cohesiveness. Student achievement scores in math and reading were aggregated to school-level means. The correlations for the entire sample were positive, indicating that the higher achieving schools tended to be the ones where  principals had high (mean) survey ratings, and where teachers were relatively cohesive or likeminded regarding their principal and school climate. The mean responses and the cohesiveness measures were also entered into factor analyses with the school as the unit of analysis. The first and largest factor in the analysis of mean survey responses was largely a measure of the principal as an effective interpersonal leader who commands the respect and support of the school staff. However, this factor diminishes by the time students reach ninth grade and above. Six references are listed. The appendixes, comprising over half of the document, display data tables which present the factor analysis results and the correlation results of survey items with achievement. (MLF)",

School buses are constructed differently from automobiles in terms of (1) the locations of doors and instrument panels relative to passengers, (2) outer construction, (3) seat design and padding, and (4) visibility on the road. Under current regulations, bus seats are constructed so safely that wearing seat belts is more likely to increase injuries than to decrease them. Several state and national organizations concerned with safety and pupil transportation have stated that current regulations provide adequate protection and that seat belts will not enhance passenger safety. Many more students are fatally injured while waiting for or leaving their buses than while travelling in them, suggesting that safety  measures associated with improved driver training, &quot;loading zone&quot; design, and public information are now of more significant concern than additional safety equipment.

This document reviews a number of policy options availaable to public education systems for providing educational choice. Options at the state level include the use of education vouchers, subsidized transfer to selected schools, and authorization of home instruction. States can also encourage options at the local level by allowing school choice within a district, permitting variations in curriculum among district schools, and providing different avenues to accreditation. Local districts can establish policies for choice by easing attendance area restrictions, enabling students to change teachers when appropriate, establishing special schools to provide focused programs for  selected groups of students, and relaxing curricular rigor. Providing greater choice involves confronting administrative, fiscal, social, and political obstacles, but the potential benefits appear to warrant some degree of flexibility. (PGD)",

Among the typical kinds of measures of school climate currently in use are normative approaches that focus on students' and teachers' perceptions of school norms, ecological approaches that focus on classroom behavior as perceived by participants, and external observation methods that bring in outside observers to collect quantitative or qualitative data. The literature on organizational climate suggests additional factors to consider when selecting measurement techniques or analyzing the findings of research. First, conceptual distinctions have been found between organizational climate, group  climate, and psychological climate. Second, quesitons exist concerning whether several climates may exist in an organization if the members of the organization are not in agreement in their perceptions. Third, the various methods for measuring climate may not share the same level of validity. Fourth, the effects of environmental change on perceptions are unclear. Fifth, differences among individuals may account for some variations in perception of climate. Specific research efforts are cited as typical examples of the different measurement methods discussed.

Student background variables do not appear to account for all the important differences among students attending public and private schools. This document proposes and tests a model of school selection that relates school choice to a family's assessment of public and private school quality. The assumption is that unless private schools appear to offer distinct advantages they would not be selected over tax-supported public schools. The model was tested using data from the High School and Beyond studies of1980 and 1982. The researchers determined that when estimates of the educational  production function for public and private schools were corrected for sample selection bias using the school choice model, private schools no longer displayed a significant advantage over public schools in educating the average student. This report describes the model, reviews the data used to test the model, presents the equation that expresses the concepts in the model, discusses the application of educational production functions, and explains how these elements can be manipulated to reveal relative school effectiveness.

Data were gathered both before and after the training period in three forms: classroom observations of teachers' practices and teacher and student questionnaires. The data generated failed to support the hypotheses that trained teachers would prove more effective than untrained teachers in (1) communicating learning goals; (2) communicating what, how, and when learning is to be assessed; (3) using tests reflecting learning goals; (4) using a  variety of test formats; (5) establishing criteria for evaluating responses; or (6) providing specific feedback to students.

An additional purpose was to investigate the influence of school procedures on student absence rates. Four major procedures were identified: monitoring and recording attendance, excusing absences, imposing penalties for unexcused absences, and intervening in patterns of chronic absenteeism. The evidence suggests that a centralized computer system for monitoring and recording attendance should be combined with school-based microcomputer systems for short-term monitoring and feedback. Questionnaires revealed that many teachers  are frustrated by the responsibility of excusing student absences and are dissatisfied with parents' adherence to predefined criteria for excuses. Penalties imposed for unexcused absences appear to be most effective with students who are college-oriented. Intervention in cases of chronic truancy is controversial and at best only sporadic. The approach that is advocated for managing student absenteeism is to combine increased strictness with more ambitious interventions into the problems of the chronic truants, including efforts to improve teaching quality and make classes more interesting or relevant.

The study was guided by the advice of school administrators and a theoretical model of the influences or levels of participation in work organizations. Evidence indicates that skipping and cutting are serious problems among portions of the students in the schools studied. Boys skipped more frequently than girls, and skipping was most frequent among 11th and 12th graders. Student questionnaires indicated the biggest reason for skipping whole days was that students needed to be at home or had something better to do. Selective cutting was most often due to dislike of a particular class or not  having completed homework assignments; peer pressure also contributed. Those students who reported infrequent skips scored high on an index of educational ambitions. There was no relationship between the index of perception of rule enforcement and frequency of skips; parental supervision was a stronger inhibiting factor. Since a number of factors and events may contribute to skipping, it may take a major change in the culture before specific factors exert much of an influence. (GJ)",

The study was conducted in three parts: (1) districtwide and school-level organizational data were obtained through interviews with the 10 principals; (2) a questionnaire was administered to 439 teachers; and (3) 80 teachers were interviewed. Of the three districts studied, one, located in a community of mixed ethnicity and socioeconomic status, had peaceful labor relations; the second, also in a mixed-race community, had  highly acrimonious labor relations; the third, a suburban high school district, serving a changing population and experiencing severe enrollment declines, practiced a \"cooperative mode\" of collective bargaining.

        "description":"The Action Research on Change in Schools (ARCS) project was a collaborative action research study that involved two levels of research: a specific research project in each of two junior high schools in Michigan and New Hampshire, and a simultaneous study of the collaborative action research process itself as it relates to teachers' individual stages of development. Both teams involved all staff members in research activities that focused on evaluation studies of school-based scheduling issues and their effect on curriculum and instruction. Three empirical measures assessing moral judgment, ego development, and conceptual complexity were administered to all participating teachers, and a variety of documentation techniques were used to record and monitor the process of action  research in each team. This executive summary presents findings from both levels of the study. First, a comparison is presented of teachers at each of the four stages of development: conventional, transitional, goal-oriented, and self-defining. Next, the collaborative action research process is described, along with teacher-perceived outcomes in the areas of school context, collegiality, teachers as action researchers, and collaborative action research. A discussion ensues of collaborative action research as it relates to staff development and school improvement. The report concludes with implications of the findings for principals and school administrators and for staff developers, teacher educators, and researchers. References are included. (TE)",

The seven videotaped conferences selected for analysis involved advisers with 1 to 3 years' experience and teachers practicing at levels from the first grade to high school. Each adviser in the Marin County (California) Office of Education's Teacher Advisor Project was a teacher assigned on a full-time basis to advise teachers at up to four school sites. The adviser role involved recruiting teachers to be advised, organizing observations and conferences, and offering advice (though the tapes revealed such  instances were rare in practice, for several possible reasons). The tapes illustrated six principles of face-to-face advising. Three involved talk about teaching: the use of common language, the ability to focus, and the provision of hard evidence. The other three enhanced collegial trust: the encouragement of interaction, reliance on a predictable agenda, and the display of reciprocal respect. Examples were drawn from the tapes to illustrate successful interactions and successful conference leadership by advisers. (PGD)",

As the demand for new teachers is increasing, the number of new teaching graduates is decreasing proportionally. A national teacher shortage is imminent and already exists is some locations and in some subjects areas such as math and science. In Oregon, a recession has curbed the crisis, but retirements and resignations could create a shortage within the next four years. Historically, there have been four responses to a severe teacher shortage: (1) raid other schools; (2) drop standards for entering the teaching field; (3) raise the student/teacher ratio; and (4) use misassignments and emergency certification. All four have proved to be  unsatisfactory. A positive step that can be taken is to talk now with the state Legislatures, the Department of Education, and the professional organizations about the need to prevent any drastic decrease in teaching quality. Districts should also look closely at hiring patterns and at training mentor teachers. Job sharing should be encouraged and recent retirees should be viewed as a major resource. The use of extracurricular support personnel and the role of technology should also be considered. (GJ)",

A typology of schools is proposed to account for the schools' basic orientation toward administration and instruction. Administrative processes reflect one of three belief systems--the bureaucratic-rationalistic, the political-organic, and the cultural--that describe the ways schools go about making policy decisions and allocating resources. Based on this typology, seven core studies are proposed that would address the following school processes: (1) organizing, planning, and informing;  (2) resource allocation; (3) curriculum and instruction; (4) managing co-curricular education; (5) guidance services; (6) monitoring and evaluation; and (7) adolescent enculturation. The report concludes by suggesting that renewed attention to school assessment processes could stimulate collaborative management that continuously assesses current practice based on a systematic data-based profile of performance-related school processes coupled with an aspirational model of the school's organizational culture.

Studies of this approach and implications of its use with children who are developmentally or language delayed are discussed. The theoretical reasons why incidental teaching might be expected to be effective are briefly discussed and studies evaluating its general effects are noted. Three conclusions are cited from the research: incidental teaching (1) teaches target skills effectively in the natural environment; (2) typically results in generalization of  those skills across settings, times, and persons; and (3) results in gains in the formal functional, and possibly the strategic aspects of language. Future research should focus on analyses of general effects, analyses of how these effects are influenced by individual differences among subjects, and ways that incidental teaching technology can be systematically utilized within the education system and with parents.

Videotapes were analyzed for adult-child interactions and for each question asked by the adult of the child. On the whole, teachers behaved in a very similar manner with both special needs and nonspecial needs Ss. However, nonspecial needs Ss initiated 32 interactions with the adults while special needs Ss initiated only 14. Teachers asked significantly more questions of special needs Ss than nonspecial needs Ss. Evaluation questions were the most frequently  asked of both groups.

The third paper documents that intellectually handicapped students can function effectively as tutors in a total class approach, given adequate training and supervision. The fourth paper describes a study in which behaviorally disordered students tutored gifted students in sign language and had positive effects on gifted students' attitudes towards their tutors. The fifth study  examined whether a reverse-role tutoring program could be executed successfully within a 10-week period using 11 learning disabled and 11 non learning disabled fifth and sixth graders. The total class tutoring method was used with deaf adolescents and results are reported in study 6.

Researchers examined two samples of exceptionally gifted boys and their families. One sample had cognitive scores within the 99th percentile in the mathematics-science domain; the other had IQ's over 150. The study was based on the following set of postulates: (1) creativity and intelligence share a number of attributes and perform in similar ways within a person's interactions with his environment; (2) the gifted person must undergo several developmental transformations that change their early giftedness into appropriate dispositions; (3) these transformations begin within the family but become refined by formal and  informal education; (4) the family directs a child's early giftedness into progressively more suitable interests; (5) giftedness has a developmental history of its own. Results demonstrated statistical support for the association between the measures of creative potential and creative performance; moreover, the high IQ sample had creativity scored more closely tied to family variables that the math-science group. Researchers concluded that different types of cognitive exceptionality relate to different patterns of family experiences as conveyed by measn of their parents' personality traits. (RB)",

        "description":"The paper describes the need for increased training in services for learning disabled (LD) college students, noting large increases in numbers of LD students attending college. The role of special education teacher trainers in serving this population is stressed. Training roles are considered for special education teacher trainers in direct service and leadership training. Approaches to training are said to require cross-disciplinary efforts with input from counseling, school psychology, higher education, and special education, as well as rehabilitation. Direct service personnel competencies are seen to include assessment of adults, implementation of academic and learning strategies interventions, individual and group counseling, and consultation with college faculty. Leadership  personnel require competencies in applied research and program evaluation. (CL)",

Developed by an Arizona state task force, the manual begins with a rationale to students, employers, and the community. A model conceptualizes the career development process as it relates to handicapped students, specifying phases of community awareness, interest and job awareness, prevocational development, vocational skill development, skills application, and specialized services/referral. The manual then addresses work experience programs, which fit into the skills application phase of the continuum. Types of work experiences are described along with goals and information on student selection. Program implementation aspects  covered include identification and selection of training/work stations, supervision and evaluation of students' work experience, selection of work experience coordinators, program evaluation, and curriculum and instruction. Recommended program standards are proposed.

Functional assessment and programing determined the specific instructional needs of each S. A changing criterion design was conducted to shape the hip and knee extensors for both Ss. Intensive habit shaping procedures of hip and knee extensors which facilitate standing were successful with each S; however, the retarded S took longer to develop the prerequisite strength for standing and required more extensive programing than the elderly S. Collateral effects for the retarded S included reciprocal functioning of the knee flexors to the knee extensors and the  development of timing to integrate two basic motor components of the standing task.

The function of channel management is to select the most efficient channel, taking into account the environment, product, and consumer characteristics. When language is seen as a product, the learner as a consumer, and the various levels of government and educational administration as elements of the channel, the approach can be applied to language planning, of which English for Specific Purposes (ESP) should be seen as an integral part. The number of institutions from production to  consumption indicates the length of a channel. The longer the channel, the more likely the planning goals are to be distorted or modified, unless links between the levels are maintained and effective feedback procedures exist for movement of information between and within levels.

A relatively structured process approach, developed for advanced-level students who need to write college-level expository essays and compositions, presents composing and idea generation as a complex, systematic whole. The method uses a series of eight writing stages, each of which has two constantly interacting facets, thinking and writing. Also, each stage interacts within itself and with the other stages in any order, any number of times. The system gives both direction and freedom to the student and, while it uses  elements common in composition instruction and materials, it is unusual in its integration of a large number of elements into a whole along with great flexibility of application.

Some of the findings were the following: there was no  overlap of oral proficiencies between the core and immersion students; with the exception of pronunciation, the unmodified novice level descriptions applied to the core students; the modified ratings, labeled &quot;junior,&quot; include some content areas typically rated &quot;novice&quot;; the differences within the relatively fluent immersion group were primarily in their abilities to discuss familiar or unfamiliar, complex situations, and concrete or abstract ideas.

However, after World War II, structural linguistics applied to the classroom produced audiolingualism, which was a method heavily influenced by behavioral psychology. New interest in estimating the quantity of sounds and structures learned as habit led to discrete-point testing, a trend reflected in the American emphasis on standardized testing and a variety of discrete-point test formats. Audiolingualism never delivered the results its theoreticians promised, either empirically or theoretically. Contrastive analysis, while useful in examining learner errors arising  from differences between languages, will not predict errors from irregularities within a language, a major source of learner problems. In addition, language points are not really discrete, and are not entirely subject to the relatively inflexible discrete-point measurement. Language proficiency is increasingly viewed as a global skill, and language testing has become more integrative. (MSE)",

        "description":"One teacher's experience with changes in writing skills and attitudes while teaching writing led to studies of the experiences of three female graduate student writing tutors with widely varying backgrounds working in a university tutorial service. One was a student from a blue collar family who had entered college as a mature student; one had previously been a nurse; the third had a solid academic background with coursework in linguistics and writing. It was found that their teaching experience during the school year significantly changed their own writing processes and their attitudes about writing. Each tutor had an individual style and continued to develop her own repertoire of writing strategies. The tutors found that despite differing backgrounds and proficiency levels, the  conceptual tasks in writing became more complex. The study emphasized how active engagement in teaching writing is a rich source of information about the writing process for the teacher as well as for the student. (MSE)",

        "description":"A workshop was developed at the Bank of Canada to give instruction in writing brief summaries of financial analyses to junior economists entering the bank after university. These employees were expected to write these analyses for the senior officers of the institution. It had been found that the specialists had not learned strategies for exploring their statistical data with the objective of identifying the deeper meaning or story in the data and then presenting it in the expected format. They had been following a restrictive sequence of procedures and producing unconnected series of relatively superficial observations about their data, which did not satisfy their audience's need for a story. The workshop had three goals: to make explicit the information needs of the readers, to  develop the specialists' ability to use writing strategies for better analysis, and to enable the specialists to provide sharply focused and effectively structured summaries that represented their best judgment, as technical experts, about the essential story contained in the data. The content of the workshop included discussion of the writing process, direct contact with the audience for the texts, and instruction in developing a preliminary writing plan, drafting, and revision. The workshop has resulted in texts containing more meaningful analyses, more direct discussion of the analyses between the specialists and the senior officer, and increased confidence and analytical capabilities in the specialists.

Because both deal with patterns of organization and information, it would seem that linguistics could contribute to their advancement. The main concept in information systems is distinctiveness, with its attendant notion of code. The main activity in information technology is the designing, implementation, and checking of devices capable of effecting specified operations on codes while preserving certain types of distinctiveness. Similarly, in biological engineering, the primary concern is with genetic codes expressed in the systems of the cell. The type of awareness linguists have developed about language, or psychologists  and ethnologists about other sense systems, is needed to bring scholars in technology a wider, contextual perspective on what they are trying to do, especially since the objects they are dealing with are increasingly linked to their contexts.

        "description":"All speakers bring to even simple verbal encounters complex presuppositions and expectations that may create discourse interference. A second-language encounter carries a complex and often inexplicable expectation load. Language expresses meaning and intentions, but also carries social import. The value or appropriateness of speaking itself varies interculturally and intraculturally when it is considered in combination with sex, age, or participant status. Styles of presentation, including speech style, use of phatic communion, overlapping and turn-taking, and nonverbal behavior, vary considerably within and among groups. Nonnative speakers who do not know the codes or rituals of a group, or who use them inappropriately, will be judged, consciously or unconsciously, as  inefficient in the communicative task. Discourse interference can even be produced by aspects of the second-language learning process, including instructor attitudes, the availability of appropriate social and functional models, and structural forms. The type of second language, its formality, elaborateness, registers, code systems, and the interest with which it is presented will color the learner's perceptions, competence, and successful communication with native speakers. An instructor can and should create awareness of the variability of intercultural encounters and potential areas of misinterpretation. (MSE)",

In one experiment, 5 groups of 10 children at 34, 39, 46, 52, and 57 months were tested for comprehension and production of 14 pairs of Chinese spatial words. In the comprehension test the children were asked to point to pictures corresponding to the words spoken; in the production test they were asked to say the opposite of the word spoken by the experimenter. Results indicated a high degree of consistency in the order of acquisition, which paralleled findings in English acquisition studies and was consistent with theory. However, the theory that unmarked words should be learned before the marked words was not supported. In the second experiment 3 groups of 10 children aged 34, 46, and  57 months were tested for their comprehension of two pairs of spatial terms. An object was placed in relation to another object having one or the other of the following characteristics: (1) inherent top, bottom, front, and back; (2) inherent front/back but not top/bottom; (3) inherent top/bottom but not front/back; and (4) neither top/bottom nor front/back. Results indicated that under all conditions even the youngest children had almost perfect comprehension of top and bottom but imperfect comprehension of front/back for objects without inherent front/back markings.

Results indicated that U.S. history teachers are generally well trained and that most are licensed in their teaching areas. Course content is usually taught in chronological order with an emphasis on textbook usage. U.S. history teachers create about  one-third of their own curriculum materials. Traditional lectures and class discussions are the most widely used teaching methods, but homework assignments are varied and diversified. Teachers generally create their own tests, which are predominately objective in design. U.S. history is taught in a traditional manner which emphasizes historical content.

A women's studies ethics course was introduced to undergraduates in the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. It provides a broad political and social justice approach and attempts to move student thinking from individual needs to social responsibility in both private and public life. The course highlights problems of inequality and the ethics of racism, sexism, classism, imperialism, and  exploitation. Emphasis is placed upon examining the social changes affecting the choices students must make when they face ethical dilemmas. Topics include such issues as abortion, sexuality, reproduction technology, and medical ethics during different historical periods. As a result, students learn that answers are not always absolute, but must sometimes be based on situational ethics. The course outline is included as an appendix. (JHP)",

Volunteer participants were asked to describe in writing the process through which they began to desire an automobile. They were then orally interviewed and each case was separately analyzed. The phenomenon of the concept of &quot;lack&quot; is explored, and two case studies are analyzed in order to determine the circumstances in which individuals believe they have experienced negative situations because they lack car ownership. Findings  indicate that the more possessions an individual owns, the more things that a person believes they lack or need and that the emergence of desire to purchase an item is based upon a person's experiencing a &quot;lack&quot; situation.

Findings indicated that, while some regional differences do exist, they are not great. The desire to increase arts-related activities is not as strong as the desire to increase less focused leisure activities, but there appears to be a strong unmet demand for increased opportunities to participate in arts-related programs, including both visual and performing arts. While southerners cite cost and accessibility as barriers to participation, non-southerners mention lack of time. Achieved educational levels and prior exposure to the arts are significantly related to arts participation  rates. Singing in a chorus is the activity in which southerners are most clearly differentiated from the non-southern population in terms of greater participation and demand. Lack of talent was cited by southerners as a reason for non-participation in contrast to non-southerners' response of lack of training. Leisure pursuits of most southerners are not related to the type of work they do. While the best predictor of current levels of participation is prior participation, this factor was not confirmed with respect to the desire to increase participation in the future.

Theater activity has increased regionally, because of the growth of nonprofit regional theaters and the emergence of truck and bus touring operations. Almost all of the current nonprofit theaters have been founded in the last 20 years, resulting in significant changes in U.S. theater. Theater audiences are better educated and more affluent than the general population. That the economic  effects of theatre production are substantial is supported by statistics indicating an almost 300 million dollar contribution to the national economy. While total actor employment has increased, it has not done so as quickly as union membership has grown, and most actors receive low salaries.

Specific purposes of the study were aimed at developing a better understanding of U.S. craft artists and organizations. Findings indicated that a typical craft organization has existed for 10 years, has 90 local members, is involved in exhibits, sales, and workshops, is a nonprofit corporation, and has an annual budget of $3,500. Not all of its members work in the same medium, but a majority work with clay or fiber mediums. The largest number of the estimated 1,218 U.S. organizations is located in the east north central states, while the highest number of artists resides in New England and the  eastern south central states. Over 60 percent of the responding organizations are involved in more than one craft medium. Jury review as a prerequisite to membership is imposed by 30 percent of craft organizations. Provided services and activities are frequently available to the general public, while special functions and publications tend to be oriented toward members. Most of these organizations perceive themselves as having few serious problems; there is also evidence that accelerated formation of crafts organizations occurred 5 to 10 years ago and that the current tendency is toward consolidation, rather than expansion.

        "description":"Ethnic differences are valuable to the well-being of society, but it is difficult to determine how to transmit this cultural value from one generation to another. The development of the value of cultural pluralism is dependent upon the development of both a comprehensive theory of cultural pluralism and a model of cultural transmission which focus on the breadth, depth, and changes of ethnic groups within society. Four conditions must be met for cultural pluralism to thrive: (1) cultural diversity must be present within society; (2) interaction must exist between and among groups; (3) co-existing groups must share approximately equal political, economic, and educational opportunity; and (4) society must value cultural diversity. Since all aspects of cultural pluralism and  transmission are constantly in a state of flux, the resultant effect is that each group and society itself continually evolves or changes. Some groups are assimilated, others form, and still others grow larger. Lack of representation of minorities in the teaching force limits the potential for affirmation of pluralism. If cultural diversification exists within a group, the potential for pluralistic values increases. Students must be taught that there are benefits in cultural awareness, and, while classroom learning situations should focus on the major values of society itself, an understanding of the value of differences should be promoted.

Students are introduced to the concept of food as the most basic human need, and they explore differences between wants and needs. The concepts of hunger, malnutrition, and starvation are demonstrated through observation of the growth of a classroom plant. Using a world map, students learn the concepts about developed and developing nations in relation to the division of countries along economic levels. Handouts titled &quot;Statistics on World Hunger&quot; and&quot;World Distribution of Arid Regions&quot; are used to help explain the causes of hunger. To increase understanding of developing nations people, students read the handout &quot;A Day in the Life of a Third World Teenager.&quot; The lesson is concluded by discussion of what individuals can do to reduce world hunger.

Continued implementation of the Constitution requires that its text, its structure, and its principles be widely known and respectfully understood. U.S. citizens need to respect the Constitution as it was understood by those who framed it. Underlying the Constitution is a &quot;science of politics.&quot; The principles of this science of politics (federalism, separation of powers, representation, an extended republic) decisively influenced the framers as they drafted the Constitution. The Constitution is a political document, but it cannot be identified with a political agenda, whether right, left, or center. The Constitution sets up institutions through which people make political decisions.  Leadership on the basis of definite political values and objectives is the province of the legislative and executive branches. The judicial branch's role is to exercise judgment. Judicial review, by enforcing the terms of the Constitution, protects the long-term public will against short-term popular passions. As the United States enters its third century under the Constitution, citizens would do well to remember that just as the Constitution cannot be reduced to a political agenda, it is also the measure of all political action taken.

This was the finding of a study designed to ascertain economic attitudes in adolescents. Economic attitudes were measured by an instrument which used eight moderately reliable multi-item scales. The measure was applied in a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design to two groups of ninth-graders. One group had previous economics instruction and the other had not. This research design measured the affective impact of a cognitively-oriented economics curriculum. The research was based on two hypotheses: (1) that economics instruction would have an impact on student attitudes toward economic issues; and (2) that the observed attitudinal changes would be in the same direction  as affective changes associated with developmental trends. At the pretest, there were no systematic or statistically significant differences between the two groups. Analysis of covariance at the posttest showed modest but statistically significant differences between the groups on five scales. The results also gave qualified support to the hypothesis that these instructional effects may be interpreted as an acceleration of developmental trends in economic and related social attitudes.

        "description":"Textbook censorship cases from Tennessee and Alabama have been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court. In east Tennessee, fundamentalist families objected to a 1983 Holt, Rinehart, and Winston reading series for grades 1-8. Federal District Judge Thomas G. Hull held that Hawkins County Schools had violated the families' First Amendment rights and ordered the system to permit the parents to teach reading at home. In Mobile, Alabama, Federal District Judge W. Brevard Hand said, &quot;For purposes of the First Amendment, secular humanism is a religious belief system,&quot; and ordered that 44 elementary and secondary textbooks be removed from Alabama public schools. &quot;Secular humanism&quot; became a pejorative term in 1982 during the fundamentalist crusade against sex education in a Corvallis,  Oregon high school. The fundamentalist crusade dates back to a reaction against Charles Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species&quot; (1859). Today, it is driven by fear of change, fear of crime, fear of drug use, and other dislocations in society. The organization People for the American Way makes several suggestions to prepare for censorship attacks. The key suggestions are that school systems need: (1) a publicized written selection policy for books and other media; (2) a list of elective and required courses, specifying those requiring parental permission; (3) a statement of the school's curriculum, goals, and philosophy; and (4) procedures for making, receiving, verifying, discussing, and resolving censorship complaints. School personnel, students, and parents should be familiar with the complaining  organizations, their arguments, and vocabulary. Finally, censorship cases are usually curtailed when the educational community works together for quality education. (Thirty-five footnotes are appended.) (SM)",

In 1748, a French nobleman, Baron de Montesquieu, wrote a book called &quot;The Spirit of the Laws,&quot; in which he argued that there could be no liberty when all government power was held by one person or even one group of rulers. Montesquieu described a political system that separated power into three branches of government. He believed that a government based on the &quot;separation of powers&quot; plan would ensure liberty by preventing the establishment of an absolute ruler like Louis XIV. The impact of absolute rule is illuminated through a short discussion of the French Huguenots' oppression during the reign of Louis XIV. The  principle of separation of powers is depicted through a discussion of the Radical Republicans in Congress and the impeachment proceedings against President Andrew Johnson. The last lesson focuses on the separation of powers in the U.S. government by reviewing the power to declare war. Even though Congress has declared war five times, U.S. soldiers have been sent into combat situations over 100 times by the President acting as commander-in-chief of the military.

Dennis Gray maintains in \"Excellence as Juggernaut\" that, with the advent of \"excellence in education,\" there has been increased lobbying from each of the disciplines for inclusion in the curricula. In order to adequately teach all the disciplines, restructuring of schools is necessary. Teachers must spend more time involved in serious discussion of  ideas and issues with fewer students. Related disciplines should be integrated--in both curriculum content and in instructional methods. Eight high schools in Los Angeles are merging history, literature, and the arts in a pilot program. Students will find themselves learning about a single period of history in several courses. Elliot W. Eisner says, in \"Why Arts Are Basic,\" that a virtue of an effective arts education is helping children learn from what they see, hear, and touch. The document concludes with a review, by John Holdren, of the book, \"Within the Walled Garden: The Story of a School,\" by Charles Merrill. (SM)",

        "description":"Forty years ago, George F. Kennan advanced the doctrine of containment against Soviet encroachment throughout the world. The Soviet Union has evolved from a Eurasian land power into a global superpower. In an effort to create an international environment congenial to domestic reforms, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has sought greater tranquility along Soviet borders. He seeks to exploit latent anti-nuclear sentiment in Europe and to challenge the conceptual underpinnings of Western deterrence. While an Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement would represent a major victory for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), there are some who fear Gorbachev's moves represent a more subtle and effective means of removing the U.S. nuclear presence from Europe. This would  leave a denuclearized Europe alone to face numerically superior Soviet conventional forces. These concerns can be dealt with by recognizing that NATO will need to retain a significant nuclear element in its strategy of flexible response. That element will be composed of nuclear warheads on INF aircraft and U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Gorbachev is also attempting to improve relations in the Far East and to exploit the turmoil in the Persian Gulf area. However, any significant change in the conduct of Soviet foreign policy will only gradually emerge. The future U.S.-Soviet relationship is likely to continue to contain elements of conflict and cooperation. A firm, consistent, and patient policy can help the U.S. attain its foreign policy goals.

The text outlines national security topics beginning with the writing of the U.S. Constitution and continuing through contemporary issues. Unit 1 focuses on the powers relating to national security and how they are distributed between the President and Congress. Unit 2 emphasizes the westward expansion of the nation before the Civil War and how national security was affected by that growth. Unit 3  discusses national security problems relating to the Civil War. Unit 4 stresses the problems caused by the nation's development into a world power after the Civil War. Unit 5 focuses on the two World Wars and national security topics related to them.

        "description":"Kindergarten teachers do not view social studies as an important part of the preschool curriculum. This was the finding of a survey of kindergarten teachers in two midwestern states. The questionnaires used in the survey were designed to determine the emphasis teachers placed on specific social studies topics, skills, and values. Teachers indicated they spent an average of 22.6 minutes each day on social studies. Sixty-six percent of the teachers integrate social studies into other teaching areas. The data indicated that as teachers gain experience, they tend to place less emphasis on teaching social studies. It is clear that the priority placed on other curricular areas is affecting the amount of time spent on teaching social studies and may affect the availability of  instructional materials. Teacher-made units structure learning activities. Materials and resources most often used are picture study, the school library, role play, puppetry, and learning centers. There is more agreement among teachers on the importance of specific affective topics than on which skills or content should be taught. Well defined state guidelines, parental sanctions, and appropriate materials would serve to improve the position of social studies in the curriculum. Teachers must agree on what content, concepts, attitudes, and skills should be taught and make a commitment of time to teach them. (SM)",

The instructor may show short scenes from several films, to allow students to choose one film to view at their leisure. After viewing the film, the student reads a teacher-prepared essay on the film, critiques the content, and suggests parallels with other historical events. From a list provided by the instructor, the student selects a report topic. Papers may be rewritten until two  weeks before the end of the semester, as the student continually refines research and writing skills. The project may be adapted for use in other subjects. (SM)",

        "description":"This document reports on a summer institute for 20 secondary school history teachers from the central Virginia public school community. Emphasis at the institute was on the fact that historically, as well as morally, all people are important. This idea is the basis for the \"new social history\" that tends to start with everyday experience. Because most U.S. high school history teachers completed their education before the development of an emphasis on social history, an institute was held to engage them in discussions about social history. The two-week seminar began each day with a lecture of 45 to 60 minutes by an historian, sociologist, or anthropologist and was followed by discussions. Ten books germane to the \"new social history\" served as a focus for the institute. Ten  lecturers addressed four themes: (1) mobility and community; (2) religiousness; (3) a nation of immigrants; and (4) changing notions of the character and make-up of the family. Stephen Innes, Associate Professor of History, University of Virginia, addressed the question of why so much social history involves studies of neighborhoods and small towns. Robert Cross, Professor of History, University of Virginia, suggested that the questions asked since 1945 generated the new social history. An evaluation of the institute by the directors suggested that, even though the lecturers were outstanding, the discussions were not as animated as hoped because of the constraining factors of the risky nature of the subject matter and the participants' unfamiliarity with each other.

Students' beliefs are defined according to their reactions to specific U.S. foreign policy initiatives. Three areas have aroused considerable campus reaction and exemplify students' perception of this &quot;stop Communism&quot; approach as controlling U.S. foreign policy. The areas are: (1) nuclear arms proliferation; (2) divestiture in South Africa; and (3) U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua. Students believe that the eventual goal of the arms race is to achieve a balance of power aimed at stopping Communism. Students also believe that divestiture in South Africa is opposed by the Reagan administration  because the government fears that divestiture may drive that nation into the Soviet camp. The students understand that the Reagan administration views the Contras as &quot;freedom fighters&quot; struggling for the democratic way. U.S. students would like to see a more idealistic approach in foreign policy. They see the nuclear arms race as an activity which risks planetary annihilation. They would prefer an arms limitation and a U.S. foreign policy which advocates human rights in South Africa. They would like a foreign policy which views other nations as equals instead of one that supports internal conflicts. (SM)",

It is important to teach about the Soviet Union because of: (1) its emphasis in the U.S. media; (2) its size and cultural diversity; (3) its abundance of natural resources; and (4) its cultural contributions to life in the United States. In elementary school classes, teachers might compare and contrast U.S. regions and communities with those in the Soviet Union. A more focused examination can be achieved on the middle school level through the study of Soviet history, geography, and current events. High school world history classes should  stress the teaching of Russian and Soviet history. Teaching strategies should include using an historical approach, teaching about the country's geography, comparing governmental and economic systems, stressing the cultural and ethnic diversity within the country, introducing primary sources, avoiding superficial conclusions, and presenting a balanced picture of the Soviet Union.

Each lesson in the guide contains an introduction to the main ideas of the program, a program summary, and suggested activities to carry out before and after the program. The topics emphasized in the series are: (1) limited government and the rule of law; (2) federalism; (3) separation of powers with checks and balances; (4) freedom of expression; (5) equal protection of the laws; and (6) the U.S. Constitution and the economy. Under the principles of limited government and rule of law, government officials cannot behave arbitrarily when enforcing law nor are they above the law. The national and state governments exercise  powers separately and within constitutional limits under the principle of federalism. The system of checks and balances ensures a government with powers sufficient to act effectively and limitations sufficient to prevent tyranny. The U.S. constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression is an essential condition of democracy. The &quot;equal protection&quot; clause protects individuals from arbitrary discrimination and has led to hotly contested constitutional issues such as affirmative action. The Constitution provided a framework that was conducive to economic development and national prosperity because private property rights were protected and contracts were enforced.

The catalogue contains reproductions and replications of portraits and posters that were brought together for the exhibit. The ways in which people understand their nationality influence how they raise their children and help determine the ideas and experiences to which individuals expose them. Citizens of the early nation recognized that childhood was a critical period for instilling patriotism and republican values if the new government was to survive. Michael Zuckerman writes that every citizen could see that the fate of the national experiment would depend on fostering feelings for the republic among the rising generation. Allen F. Davis points out that in thinking of U.S. values, people  most often consider U.S. heroes. These adult images form childhood attitudes and values. Randall M. Miller in &quot;Children of Democracy&quot; states that many educators insist that experience in a democratic environment teaches lessons for living in the republic. Nurture rather than nature brings forth the U.S. democracy. William W. Cutler, III says that the schoolhouse embodies many of the democratic aims of education in a free society. The schoolhouse should be a citadel of democracy. Yet, for many children who were immigrants, the U.S. ideal fell short. Tensions and conflicts among the ethnic groups often fell heaviest on the shoulders of children. (SM)",

        "author":["Hofer, Manfred"],
        "description":"Results of four experiments concerning the way young people interpret an intended or expressed sanction (praise or blame) from a teacher are presented. The intention of the four studies was to expose the flaws in Meyer's 1984 attempted explanations of such interpretation, in which sanctions are paradoxically received by the student as an evaluation of his or her talent versus effort (e.g., the student feels that greater praise goes to the less talented person for expending the greater effort). The experiments involved four groups of West German students (N=180; N=86; N=225; N=177) between the ages of 13 and 19 who interpreted teacher/student interactions on a series of questionnaires. The research was designed to test an alternative attempted explanation, and to find out in which  areas paradoxical conclusions emerge. This paper discusses results in terms of the alternative explanation, the expectation/discrepancy hypothesis. (CB)",

One hundred and twenty-eight middle school subjects learned three volleyball serves during a 3-week long unit in a physical education activity class. Subjects were divided into three groups: one followed a blocked schedule, another a serial schedule, and the third a random schedule of practice. Subjects were given skills tests with both subjective and objective criteria following completion of the unit. Results indicated no differences among groups, suggesting that laboratory findings in the the area of contextual interference do not necessarily generalize to  practical settings. (CB)",

This paper argues that the knowledge base for teaching is continually being created and interpreted, especially by practitioners. The facts frequently are less important than the judgments made in specific situations, making the teacher a \"situational decision maker.\" These two views have implications for teacher education in terms of what preservice teachers need to know and what combination of information and experience will prepare them for the next stage of development as teachers. Codification of the knowledge base for teaching can unify teacher educators if liberal arts colleges  are involved in the process and can clarify and analyze what has been learned to distinguish the knowledge base as a complex web, instead of a file cabinet filled with \"real\" research.

A sample of 29 experienced instructors was selected at random from the centers to participate in the research project designed to identify the didactical qualities of the instructors and to develop an inservice training program based on the results. Data collection involved interviews, observations of practical lessons, retrospective techniques, and log books. Discussed are several characteristics of practical teaching of the instructors, including subjectivity and intentionality, reflexivity, relation to the context, and limitation. Special attention is paid to aspects of the instructors' task environment, its influence on teaching,  and issues regarding the teaching process itself. The quality of instructors' reflections on their own teaching process has implications for a didactical inservice training program that would enable instructors to improve their teaching capabilities.

Third, teacher survey data are reported on what economic concepts are taught in the classroom and these results are compared to student findings. Finally, implications are drawn for improving classroom instruction and teacher training in  economics.

Project PRIME TIME, a state-supported program to reduce class size in kindergarten through third-grade classes, was implemented in Indiana schools during the 1984-85 academic year. Subjects were first-graders enrolled in rural schools in western Indiana. Class sizes ranged from 15 to 22 students during the 1984-85 school year. Student scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Stanford Achievement Test, Metropolitan Achievement Tests, Gates MacGinitie Reading Test, Art is Fundamental, and locally prepared basic skills tests were analyzed to determine whether differences existed between classes before and after the introduction of Project PRIME TIME. Results indicated that,  of 73 statistical test scores analyzed, 39 showed significant positive effects of the project, while 30 showed no significant differences. Only four test scores showed significant positive differences in favor of larger classes. It is concluded that state sponsored programs to reduce class size can benefit student achievement and teacher efficiency in the primary grades. (CB)",

The study described the nature of classroom task environments and their relationship to students' task-related beliefs. Students in 19 third- and fourth-grade classrooms completed questionnaires about self-competence, sense of control over outcomes, and intrinsic value of school tasks. These scores were used to identify classrooms where students held more or less desirable patterns of beliefs, and then qualitative descriptions of these classrooms were examined. Two dimensions of teachers' practices were associated with more desirable patterns of student beliefs. These were the extent to which teachers structured information about  the environment to render it predictable and comprehensible and the frequency of opportunities for students to regulate their own task activity. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of beliefs about environmental contingencies as foundational to other important beliefs. Case descriptions of two teachers are presented to illustrate these results. (Author)",

A program was developed for two areas: material modification and client learning strategies involving oral language, reading, and writing. Post-testing showed improvements in most areas and additionally in the student's self-concept.

Transcripts of these responses were coded and analyzed for general trends and group differences. The higher rated teachers were more confident of their abilities to improve the behavior of aggressive students, and they gave more organized and detailed descriptions of their strategies for doing so. Their responses combined firmness in putting a stop to aggression and requiring aggressive students to assume responsibility for their behavior and its consequences with attempts  to resocialize these students' attitudes and beliefs or to instruct them in better ways of coping with frustration and conflict.

Implementation of these motivational guidelines (and thus differentiation of instruction between the two class sections) was variable but sufficient to produce significant improvement (from the first half to the second half of the semester) in student achievement. The treatment did not produce the expected pre-post improvement in student motivation questionnaire responses, however, and teachers who stressed strategies for capitalizing  on students' existing intrinsic motivation got better motivational results than teachers who stressed strategies for motivating students to learn. These results suggest that student motivation to learn is even more different from (specifically, even more cognitive and less affective than) intrinsic motivation than previously suspected, so that systematic teacher implementation of strategies for motivating students to learn may produce improvements primarily in measures of student achievement rather than in measures of student motivation (especially if these are conventional measures that stress affective rather than the cognitive aspects of motivation).

Also, the Potthoff technique was used to detect bias for sex, race, or the total group.

Subjects  were ages 6-16; 283 were male, 148 female; 273 were white, 158 black. Correlations between the two tests were statistically significant for all but the gifted group. Correlations were slightly higher for females and whites; the EMR subgroup showed the lowest correlation.

Empirical Bayes procedures were used in conjunction with the sample of nonhandicapped students to develop separate regression equations for each of the 145 institutions. This study examined whether regression equations based on data from nonhandicapped students predicted the performance of handicapped students as well as the nonhandicapped. The SAT performance of visually impaired and physically  handicapped people was not very different from that of the nonhandicapped students. The SAT scores of learning-disabled students were considerable lower and those of hearing-impaired students even lower. Results also showed patterns of overprediction and underprediction in FYA predictions based on high school grades alone. In addition, SAT scores from special test administrations overpredicted the college performance of students with disabilities, especially learning disabilities. This was not true, however, for hearing-impaired students. (Author/GDC)",

This alternative program was designed for students in grades 1 through 8 who had a history of two or more grade retentions. It emphasized instruction in reading and mathematics and evaluated the pre- and post-program performance in those areas, as well as on scales of affective and social development. Other variables included classroom setting (heterogeneous or homogeneous grouping), teacher expectations, degree of implementation of the curriculum model, and recency of retention. The program was based on Madeline Hunter's Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP), which emphasizes: (1) selecting learning at the correct level of difficulty; (2) teaching to the objective; (3) monitoring  learning and adjusting the teaching; and (4) using the principles of learning. Results showed that classification into the Twice-Retained program benefited students more in mathematics than in reading, where achievement declined in the higher grades. Also, mathematics achievement was higher in the homogeneously grouped classes. More benefit accrued when the academic retention was recent, and when the students were in the earlier grades (in reading). On the affective measures, students who were heterogeneously grouped fared better than those homogeneously grouped, suggesting an adverse effect of labeling retained students. (JGL)",

BPS Department of Educational Testing analyzed data from the 1986 CRT final exams in: reading and language arts (grades K-8), high school English (six levels), mathematics (grades 1-8), high school mathematics (nine levels), science (grades K-8), high school science (six levels), social studies (grades 3-8), U.S. History and Civics, Spanish I and II, and French I. BPS curriculum guides direct instruction in most subjects. Since each curriculum guide is matched with a curriculum referenced test, assessment of the extent to which students meet specific objectives set forth in the guides is  possible. This analysis is used to identify strengths and deficits in curriculum implementation or instruction as measured by student CRT performance. Results may be used for specific intervention at the school level or for discerning school district patterns. The report contains descriptions of each instrument, the specific curriculum objectives addressed by the CRT, the student population, system strengths and weaknesses, and extensive tables presenting school-by-school analyses of percent of correct responses to each test item.

Each fall, the battery is given to grades three, five, and eight under a state mandate, and to grade eleven under a local mandate. Overall student performance improved slightly in 1985 from the already very high scores of previous years; 83% of scores were either at or above the national norm. Average county scores would probably have been higher if a strong &quot;ceiling effect&quot; did not exist in some CAT subtests. Students remaining in the county for several years tended to score higher than those in the county for under three years. Most Hispanic and Black students scored higher than their counterparts nationally. Asian and White  students scored about the same. Females scored slightly higher on the total test in all grades except five, where scores were the same. School results are presented as averages over 6 years for tests and subtests, battery interquartile ranges, longitudinal and nonlongitudinal trends, and attendance statistics. Two appendices contain detailed summary data and a glossary of testing terms. (RR)",

The first study used a bogus pipeline induction (half the subjects were told their self-reporting could later be validated) before the self-report pretest. After experimental or control treatment they completed a 16-scale self-reporting instrument. The treatment was found to be effective, with bogus pipeline induction lowering self-reported preratings and preventing response shift. The second experiment examined effort justification, lowering the pretest rating to justify participation effort. It included experimental, placebo, and no-treatment conditions. Both a self-report instrument consisting of 20 self-rating scales  and a 16 three-choice item knowledge test were administered. The treatment was found to be effective and a mean pre-retrospective difference was found in both experimental and placebo conditions. Pre- and retrospective self-ratings in no-treatment controls did not differ significantly. Since response shift is a severe validity threat in conventional pretest-posttest designs using self-report measures, the retrospective pretest was recommended to control for this confounding factor. If effort justification is controlled for and social desirability can be ruled out, response shift may not occur. (MGD)",

In 16 trials, each subject drew alone and in a group, with the group being experimental confederates who erred in line drawing to influence the naive subject. The duration of the model line display varied, as did the delay before the subject began drawing. Informed subjects were advised by experimental confederates that deception was involved. Naive subjects' accuracy  significantly decreased in the group situation, conforming to lines drawn by experimental confederates. Informed subjects showed no comparable conformity.

Frequency of touch was reported by a group of community adults. Further reliability and validity data were collected using the adult sample and college student samples.

        "description":"Generalizability theory, which subsumes classical measurement theory as a special case, provides a general model for estimating the reliability of observational rating data by estimating the variance components of the measurement design. Research data from the &quot;Heart Smart&quot; health intervention program were analyzed as a heuristic tool. Systolic blood pressure readings for 17 children were taken by two nurses in one of six pairs. Differentiating the sources of error variance was carried out in what is called a &quot;G&quot; study, which used the GENOVA program to estimate the variance of measurement facets. As expected, the variance of individuals' blood pressure was large relative to pairs of nurse observers, sets of measurement, and occasions of measurement within the sets. A  generalizability coefficient is the expected squared correlation between the actual, observed scores and the full universe of scores defined by the researchers by specifying measurement facets or protocols. It allows the calculation of different coefficients, given interest in making either norm-referenced or criterion-referenced decisions. While the &quot;G&quot; study evaluated data quality for different decisions, a &quot;D&quot; study (i.e., a study estimating how many conditions are needed to obtain a certain level of generalizability) was also conducted to pinpoint sources of measurement error, so that observations could be increased on a particular facet to reduce error. Many levels for each protocol facet are needed to estimate this properly. (LPG)",

In those cases where the test had changed, it was necessary to statistically equate the new tests to the old tests, so that comparisons of equated rather than actual scores could be made during the transitional year. Tables show the battery of reading and mathematics tests administered in spring 1985 and spring 1986, for grades 2-12. In reading, tables were constructed for grades 3-11 by the equipercentile method to equate scores on the California Achievement Tests, the Degrees of Reading Power Test, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (the latter for grade 10 only). Time of test administration determined which served as pretest or  posttest. In mathematics, the equipercentile method was applied at grade 9 to equate the New York State Regents Competency Test to the New York City Mathematics Test (NYCMT). For grades 3-8, tables equating the NYCMT and the Metropolitan Achievement Test were generated by the Rasch model from 1985 pilot data sampling nine elementary and eight junior high schools. (Equipercentile and cross-grade comparisons are also shown.) All equating tables are provided in the appendices. (LPG)",

        "description":"A dilemma arises in the attempt to establish procedures for valid assessment of academic learning. Measures of learning with high pedagogical validity often have poor psychometric properties. Conversely, tests that are well-constructed by psychometric standards may succeed in sorting and ordering students or schools, but have little pedagogical relevance. There are several approaches for dealing with apparent trade-off. One way is to revise notions of achievement, moving away from test-based criteria toward performance-based criteria. Experience in native- and second-language learning is cited as instructive, because of the multidimensional emphasis on the goals of communication in realistic settings. Valid assessment depends on situation and mode of communication. A systematic,  cumulative record of performance is essential to this approach. The writing folder, a dossier kept by the student of diverse samples of his or her writing, is a good example of such a record. Another approach connects the monitoring function of assessment to the learning function at the classroom level. It uses comprehensive item pools administered by item sampling as part of a survey of teaching and learning specifically designed to reflect school learning and suggest improvements. As an example, the Second International Mathematics Study is discussed. (LPG)",

Saccadic eye movements are the basic oculomotor response associated with the acquisition of visual information and provide an objective measure of higher perceptual processes. In this investigation, three adult subjects fixated a single point of light, which was then extinguished and replaced either by one target which appeared at plus or minus 5, 10, or 15 degrees, or by two targets which appeared symmetrically at those same eccentricities. All subjects showed a directional preference (averaging about 80%) in the two-target condition, and it was found that this preference could be eliminated by  delaying by about 40 milliseconds the onset of the target presented in the preferred direction. This indicated that a 40-millisecond &quot;window&quot; of time was allocated for deciding response direction. It was also found that the saccadic latency of responses in the nonpreferred direction was affected more by a second target presented in the preferred direction than vice versa. This asymmetry in the system which controls saccadic eye movements has not previously been described. (JGL)",

This research simulated disclosure on a professional licensing examination by placing response keys to selected items in some examinees' records, and comparing their scores on a later form of the same test to scores of examinees who did not receive disclosure. Ten groups varied in number of items disclosed, number of examinees receiving disclosure, ability level of the subgroup receiving disclosure, and whether the items disclosed were anchor test or nonanchor test items. Results depended on the degree of exposure to test items; the greatest score differences were found in the group in which the  greatest number of people received disclosure on the greatest number of test items. The effect of item disclosure on passing scores and passing rates was also examined. Results depended on whether the disclosed items were anchor or nonanchor items and whether the benefit of disclosure was direct or indirect. It was a concluded that there is currently no perfect equating method for test disclosure and that test fairness is more complicated than originally thought. Efforts to have fair disclosure in occupational licensing tests must be weighed against the need to protect the public. (JGL)",

PUMS needed to be reorganized along relational lines by identifying the variables most widely used by researchers and constructing proper relations containing these variables. PUMS contains 11 million records for individuals and 4 million records for households; in its original format, each household record is followed by the &quot;person&quot; records for that household. The PUS801000 database is a reduction of PUMS database to construct a 1/1,000 sample of U.S. households (94,201 households; 226,458 persons), in which each household is coded uniquely (by state/number) and each person in the  household receives a meaningful number code. (All variables are integer format except for H=Household and P=Person.) Questions that could not be addressed by the basic relational operations of traditional projection and restriction, and the problem of record concatenation can be addressed by the QUEL programming language. Programming steps are described for creating married couples as a unit of analysis. This involves the complex process of identifying primary family couples and subfamily couples in households.

Two types of existing programs, developed and used at Brigham Young University, are described: adaptations of existing video material, such as the classic Mexican film \"Macario,\" and free branching simulations of real life situations, such as the videodisc \"Montevidisco.\" Evaluation of videodisc programs must consider three kinds of empirical activities: (1) development, content and presentation of the videodisc itself (formative evaluation); (2) learning outcomes produced (summative evaluation); and (3) interaction of the technology with student control of the learning. Furthermore, evaluation of student learning from the videodisc  programs must consider both system-generated data (e.g. length of session, choices made by student, responses to questions, etc.) and non-system generated data (contextual variables, students' self-reports, and students' ability). Although there is little evaluative data on videodisc instruction, data from two studies are presented: outcomes of the college-level \"Macario\" program, and high school Spanish. In both studies, the students using the videodisc instruction did significantly better on posttests of content and listening comprehension than students in traditional programs. Finally, questions and issues to be considered in future evaluations of videodisc instruction are discussed. (JGL)",

Three meta-analysis methods were used: (1) vote counts and vote-counting estimation procedures; (2) tests of combined significance; and (3) analyses of effect sizes. The three methods produced seemingly contradictory conclusions which were explained in terms of differences in the hypotheses tested by the methods, as well as the statistical properties of the methods. Effect-size analyses were found to be more informative for the study of single outcome constructs, whereas combined significance tests with or without effect-size analyses did not provide more information. Sex differences were not evident in many subject areas. However, males had  higher achievement than females in physics by one-half of a standard deviation and in biology by about one-sixth of a standard deviation. (MGD)",

        "description":"Two types of classification error are possible in competency tests: erroneous classification of an individual as a &quot;master&quot; of the subject (Type II error), and erroneous classification of a master as a &quot;nonmaster&quot; of the subject (Type I). If steps are taken to minimize Type II errors, an artificially high number of true masters will be classified as nonmasters. The remedy for this problem is to empirically correct for incorrect answers caused by irrelevant factors (fatigue, lack of motivation, etc.). This is done by self-correction: administering the test, checking it, and resubmitting the incorrectly answered questions to the student. The examinee is allowed to correct those incorrect answers. The self-correction technique was used in testing some 4,000 third-grade students in  80 elementary schools in Israel. Forty-one open-ended mathematics questions were answered and corrected. Seventy percent of students with incorrect answers provided correct answers when retested. Based on this finding, the probability of misclassification of true masters as nonmasters (Type I error) was calculated to be 40%. Further analysis showed self-correction to increase the test's internal consistency and its replicability. Retesting two weeks later provided nearly identical results. (MGD)",

To determine whether achievement test scores vary most among different fields within a grade level, or within fields among different grades, achievement test scores from 88 Israeli elementary schools were examined. Test scores of the resulting 15 combinations of grades by subjects were averaged. The average within-school variance was 25% of the total across-schools variance, showing notable heterogeneity. Computation of the within-school range for the 15 means showed 55% to exceed one standard deviation. Further analyses showed more similarity in mean achievements  of the same grade level in different fields than of different grade levels in the same field. The first analysis, involving a within-school anlaysis, had three components: between grades, between subject areas, and the interaction. The second, nonmetric analysis of the correlation matrix between the 15 school means was conducted using smallest space analysis and ADDTREE. Furthermore, in 88% of the schools where over 51% of the within-school variance was caused by a single component, that component was grade level. (MGD)",

The literature review revealed that a growing number of authors advocate qualitative methods, and that a debate exists regarding the combination of qualitative and quantitative data gathering and analysis methods. In addition, the literature search uncovered very few tests which measure student achievement in art. Interest in standardized art testing is a recent phenomenon in the United States and abroad. Other findings uncovered in the literature search included the observation that art education is particularly important at the elementary level because enthusiasm about acquiring skills in art is lacking in adolescents. The  description of the evaluation design which emerged from this research starts with an outline of sampling considerations. Evaluation activities that take place in the class are outlined next, followed by brief comments on out-of-class activities. Evaluation instruments listed include: (1) a questionnaire for art resource teachers; (2) forms for teachers' evaluation of student performance (different instruments for different grade levels); (3) an art event survey; (4) a questionnaire for art education teachers; (5) a form for collecting tests developed by art education teachers; (6) a questionnaire for students; (7) a form for interviewing students; and (8) a classroom observation form.

Focus can be on inputs to the program or outcomes from it; timing can be one-shot or continuous. Continuous measures are here considered to be monitoring--&quot;input monitoring&quot; if the measures are on inputs, &quot;impact monitoring&quot; if they are on outcomes. One-shot measures are considered to be evaluation--&quot;process evaluation&quot; if it measures inputs, &quot;impact evaluation&quot; if it measures outcome. The paper further defines program monitoring as part of the evaluation process, and notes that program evaluators must work with project managers in  making informed decisions, avoiding information overload, and implementing and monitoring effective programs. The different definitions of program monitoring by Rossi, Freeman, and Wright by the Evaluation Research Society, by the World Bank; by J. Wholey, and by the International Statistical Program Center are considered and compared. (JGL)",

Saunier conducted a stepwise regression analysis using 12 predictor variables. Due to problems with multicollinearity and because of the atheoretical nature of stepwise regression, Saunier's conclusions were only speculative. By using LISREL, the present reanalysis demonstrated the value of regressing reputational ratings on three latent variables: (1) department size; (2) faculty research productivity; and (3) the quality of program graduates. The model was tested using NRC data for each of six disciplines: English, French, philosophy, geography, political science, and sociology. The relative magnitude of the  contributions made by the three latent variables depended upon the discipline of interest, but generally size and research productivity were found to be more important than the quality of the program graduates.

Interview-based process descriptions were cross-validated using large group test data from an open-ended test and a multiple choice test. Five question formats were used to test different estimation processes: standard multiple choice; operation in foils; benchmark; and order of magnitude or operation in stems (for fractions). The mental processes tested were: (1) rounding by the usual rules to the closest power of ten or to the closest whole number; (2) front-ending, or rounding down to the power of ten of the leading digit or to the whole number of a mixed numeral; (3) other rounding, including all numbers up or some numbers up and others  down; (4) using compatible numbers or numbers relatively close to the given numbers; and (5) compensating, or adjusting an estimate to reflect variations that might result from rounding or the use of some other adjustment process. Students had a strong mental set to round numbers to the nearest leading power of ten even when the items required other estimation processes. Performance differed by item format, types of numbers and operations in the items, and grade level of students. (The appendices include some test items). (Author/JGL)",

The units, the way they are connected, the learning procedure, and the extension to iterative networks are presented. In one experiment, a network learns a set of filters, enabling it to discriminate format-like patterns in the presence of noise. The speed of learning strongly depends on the shape of the surface formed by the error measure in &quot;weight space.&quot; Examples show the shape of the error surface for a typical task and illustrate how an acceleration method speeds up descent in weight space. The main drawback of the learning procedure is the way it scales as the size of the task and the network increases. Some preliminary  scaling results show how the magnitude of the optimal weight changes depends on the fan-in of the units. A variation of the learning procedure that back-propagates desired state information rather than error gradients is developed and compared with the standard procedure. Finally, the relationship between these iterative networks and the &quot;analog&quot; networks described by Hopfield and Tank are discussed. (Author/LPG)",

To this end, the paper describes the componential theory of intelligence addressed by Sternberg et. al. This theory defines the components of intelligence by function and level of generality, including: (1) metacomponents: higher order processes involved in decision-making, planning, and evaluation; (2) performance components: processes used to manipulate and transform information in the performance of a task; (3) knowledge-acquisition components: processes involved in learning new and contextual information; and (4) general, class, or specific level of generality. The paper also reviews the literature on identification of specific components associated with  specific cognitive processes and the trainability of those processes. Following the definition and description of these information processing constructs, their use in both constructing test items and analyzing student outcomes from standardized tests is advocated. Such qualitative test analysis could possibly then be used, not just to describe or predict performance, but also to detect differences in cognitive styles and diagnose and remediate areas of weakness.

A review of the philosophies of various scholars in the field indicates that there is no single procedure for arriving at a valid statement in a scientific inquiry. Natural scientists employ a plethora of procedures for validating or rejecting the hypotheses quiding their investigations. There are various theories as to how knowledge can correspond with an observable reality. Theorists with a positivistic attitude minimize the differences between the natural and social sciences and exclude metaphysics from scientific investigation. Interpretive theorists argue that people's life-worlds are quite different  from the world of natural science and therefore, should be investigated differently. Validity is determined on the basis of intersubjective understanding and acceptability. Critical theorists have a different orientation. They look beyond the descriptions of structured social relations and emphasize, instead, the use of knowledge. It is concluded that recent attempts to reconcile different approaches to research must be discounted. Instead, students in the social sciences must be provided with a grounding in the diverse perspectives on the nature of the social world, in order to understand the independence and the interrelatedness of the various modes of inquiry.

The essay portion of the New Jersey College Basic Skills Placement Test was given to students in nine New Jersey public colleges and three New Jersey public high schools. Each student wrote two essays on two different topics. The first essay allowed 20 minutes writing time. The other allowed either 30 minutes writing time, or 10 minutes planning time plus 20 minutes writing time. There were eight groups altogether, differing on ability, order of topic-writing, and order of longer time allowed. All essays were read by two independent readers and evaluated holistically on a six-point scale. The increased time limit produced very little increase in the students' essay  scores, except at high ability levels (i.e., for those students who clearly would not need remedial writing instruction). Adding a 10-minute planning period before the 20-minute writing period tended to increase the scores of the high-ability students and also of the low-ability students who had recently written a 20 minute essay on a similar topic. The largest effect was associated with a difference in difficulty between the two topics used. (Author/JGL)",

        "description":"A correlational study of 62 8th grade, 60 11th grade, and 58 college students investigated developmental differences in learning goals, study strategy beliefs and their inter-relationship for science classes. Questionnaires measured levels of task orientation, ego orientation, and work avoidance, as well as belief in the utility of two types of strategies: those requiring deep processing of information, and those requiring only surface-level processing. Of the three goal orientations, only task orientation was significantly positively correlated with belief in the value of deep-processing strategies; this was the case at all three age levels. Valuing of the two strategy types was positively correlated for younger, but not college students, who appeared to more clearly  differentiate the two strategy types on the basis of utility for learning than did the younger groups. The results supported the hypotheses that students' personal goals for learning influence which strategies they use in studying. The nature of this influence appeared to depend in part on students' belief in or knowledge of the effectiveness of different strategy types. It is suggested that fostering interest in learning as an end in itself will prove to be more effective in teaching students effective tools of learning than emphasis on competition or grades.

The first, criterion-referenced tests, are designed to evaluate the accomplishment of specifically stated instructional objectives. Student performance is judged on the basis of the objectives, rather than in comparison to other students taking the test. The second approach is teacher-made tests, which are usually criterion-referenced mastery tests measuring small units of instruction. They can be tailored according to specific curricula and students. Teacher training in test construction and use is recommended. Contract grading is the third alternative suggested. In this system, the teacher and the student agree on the course objectives for the student, the support to be  provided by the teacher, and the evaluation method. The fourth topic is interviews. Information about student progress may come from interviews with students or their parents. The fifth method involves other documentation such as samples of the students' work, student journals and notebooks, and teachers' records. (GDC)",

        "description":"The term &quot;coaching&quot; applies to a variety of types of test preparation programs which vary in length, instructional method, and content. Most research on the effectiveness of coaching has examined the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), a measure of academic abilities used to predict college performance. This ERIC Digest reviews studies of coaching for the SAT and addresses the effectiveness of coaching. Of several studies reported between 1950 and 1967, the diversity in the research designs used, the types of coaching programs studied, and sample sizes make it difficult to compare results across studies in a meaningful way. In 1980, Slack and Porter synthesized many earlier studies on coaching, concluding that training can effectively help students raise their SAT scores. In  1978-1979, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) studied the effect of commercial coaching on SAT scores. A 1981 synthesis of coaching studies by Messick and Jungeblut included most of the studies in Slack and Porter's report, plus the FTC results. The most recent synthesis included all those studies cited by Slack and Porter, and Messick and Jungeblut. It is concluded that the data support a positive effect of coaching, but the size of the effect estimated from the matched or randomized studies (10 points) seems too small to be practically important. Sixteen bibliographic citations are included. (LMO)",

        "description":"This brief overview notes that an adaptive test differs from standardized achievement tests in that it does not consist of a certain set of items that are administered to a group of examinees. Instead, the test is individualized for each examinee. The items administered to the examinee are selected from a large pool of items on the basis of the correctness of the examinee's previous responses. Several steps are involved in constructing a computerized adaptive test (CAT): (1) the item pool must be developed; (2) some item characteristics must be calculated for each item; and (3) a strategy for deleting items from the item pool must be chosen, along with a scoring procedure. Latent trait theory assumes that an underlying trait is the sole determinant of an examinee's responses to  test items, and that performance on an item is governed by two factors: the examinee's ability and the item's difficulty. Several item selection strategies have been developed, including the Robbins Monro procedure, fixed step size, the flexilevel method, the Bayesian approach, and the stratified-adaptive approach. Advantages of CAT are its increased efficiency, optimization of the difficulty level of the test for each examinee, and administration convenience. The most obvious constraint on the use of CAT is the problem of availability of appropriate computer hardware and software. (LMO)",

The Test Collection database can be searched online for tests, using test-related terms as descriptors or identifiers. The ERIC database can be searched online using publication type codes, using test-related terms as major descriptors, and  by combining publication type code and specific test-related descriptors. The Mental Measurements Yearbook database can be searched using subject classifications.

        "description":"The rapid growth of minimum competency testing (by 1981, 36 states in the United States had mandated some form of minimum competency testing) has led to increased legal challenges of the existing testing programs. Three issues have been raised and are summarized in this brief overview: (1) constitutional claims under the due process clause; (2) equal protection; and (3) negligence or educational malpractice. Several of these issues were raised by the case of Debra P. v. Turlington which challenged the constitutionality of Florida's statewide high school graduation requirements program. The Court found that because Florida's black students had not had 12 full years of racially integrated education, they were therefore subjected to inferior educational opportunities. Such equal  protection issues affect racial minorities, those whose native language is not English, and the disabled. Issues related to due process include the speed of implementation of a testing program, test validity, and test reliability. Issues related to educational malpractice suggest that schools will need to document all phases of students' performance. In addition, increased attention will be focused on teacher certification and school accountability. (GDC)",

The report is replete with results yielded from various testing programs, the fruit of the measurement specialist's work. A second implication is that the measurement community will deal effectively with the myriad of typical testing problems, such as validity, reliability, and norms. A third implication consists of a host of highly specific matters which measurement specialists must anticipate. Some of these include an upsurge in standardized testing at the high school level and a resurgence of interest in standardized tests in content areas.  The report also contains a curiously worded call for a nation-wide (but not federal) system of state and local standardized tests. The commission seems content to rely on existing mechanisms for the creation and distribution of both tests and textbooks, while concentrating on recommendations for improvement of their quality and use.

This digest briefly reports on teacher competency testing. The 1980 Gallup Poll showed that 85% of citizens polled said teachers should be required to pass a state examination in the subjects they teach. By the end of 1981, 18 states had planned or implemented some form of testing for teacher certification. The two major teacher organizations, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National Education Association (NEA) have taken opposing sides on the issue, with the AFT firmly supporting fair and valid tests and the NEA opposed to the use of exit examinations.  Most of the arguments involved in the debate surround the following issues: (1) use of standardized tests to measure teacher competency; (2) duplication of effort between teacher competency tests and test requirements of the diploma granting colleges; and (3) use of written examinations for licensure in other professions. Other issues in teacher competency testing include: (1) establishment of cutting scores, below which applicants would not be granted certification; (2) use of norm-referenced versus criterion-referenced tests; (3) use of locally validated standardized tests versus nationally normed tests; and (4) legal and policy issues.

This study examined the effectiveness of the School Development Program (SDP) in an inner city school system. The program applies principles of social and behavioral science to every aspect of a school to improve its climate and the academic and social growth of its students. It consists of four basic components: (1) a mental health team, (2) a school governance and management body, (3) parent involvement, and (4) curriculum and staff development. Of the eight comparable schools studied, four implemented SDP and four schools did not. The schools were comparable in terms of achievement and demographics. The randomly selected  sample consisted of 142 students from SDP schools and 111 from control schools. Significant differences were found in favor of the schools with the intervention program in the following areas: (1) student achievement, (2) behavior measures, and (3) school climate. (Author/LHW)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the literature on urban school dropouts and the experiences of superintendents in attempting to lower the dropout rate. The paper is divided into two major sections. Part I examines how a mixture of societal, community, family and other influences increase the chances that an at-risk student will experience little success in school, will have low educational aspirations, and will feel alienated from the worlds of education and work. The section also includes a discussion of some of the efforts made since the early 1960s to reform education. Part II describes policies and practices that superintendents have recently found effective in increasing school holding power. The discussion is organized around the following general points: (1) Schools are working to  identify and track the student in danger of dropping out; (2) Districts are creating good school climates that generate optimism and self-esteem among both staff and students; (3) Urban educators are increasingly devoting their educational planning and resources to early intervention in the educational lives of the district's children; (4) As part of improving school climates, urban superintendents are creating ways of maintaining high performance standards, while helping students to meet them; (5) Organizing schools and providing a multiplicity of instructional programs for students with diverse educational needs has become an important strategy for reducing dropout rates; and (6) The task of lowering the dropout rate requires the joint efforts of schools and the community, who have a  shared stake in increasing the holding power of the schools.

It highlights the importance of school features, such as the homeclass, to the formation of relationships among seventh through ninth grade students. A review of research literature on this topic is presented in the areas of friendships, desegregated schools, and contact theory/categorization processes. School policies for assigning students to classrooms is the structural feature in question. The findings show that students grouped in homogeneous homeclasses with low academic status name out-of-homeclass students as their friends while students in homogeneous homeclasses of high academic status name in-class students as their friends. Students in  heterogeneous homeclasses have a more balanced structure of insider/outsider friendships. The balance may be due to the increased contact of these latter students with classmates who are more diverse than those in homogeneous classrooms. These results indicate that educators, administrators, and policy makers must become more aware of the social aspects of schooling so that the educational environment can help to foster better social development.

        "description":"This paper examines the effects of cyclical economic fluctuations on the occupational mobility of younger black and white male workers during the years between 1966 and 1975. Two measures of occupational standing were applied to 805 men who in 1966 were between the ages of 14 and 24 years. Their occupational position for the 10-year period was compared with economic upturns and recessions to ascertain racial differences in occupational gain. The analysis showed that younger black men were more likely to be at the bottom of the occupational categories than were younger white men. In all categories blacks held lower status positions than did whites. Both blacks and whites moved up the occupational hierarchy as groups, but when whites began in the same categories as blacks, they  improved their occupational status more than blacks did over the 10 years. During the economic downturn of the 1970s, black craft workers suffered large losses in occupational status relative to white craft workers. (VM)",

This study is one of several designed to identify factors which lead to success in the sciences at Xavier University of Louisiana, a small, historically black institution in New Orleans. The current investigation used linear regression analysis to identify variables which predict grades in organic chemistry at Xavier University. When only measures available on admission to college were used, high school grade point average was the best predictor for both semesters of organic chemistry. The accuracy of prediction was improved marginally by adding the ACT Composite score for the first semester only. When grades earned in previous chemistry  courses were used, prediction improved markedly, as expected. The best predictor of grades for the first semester of organic chemistry was grade in the second semester of first-year chemistry, with grade in the first semester of first-year chemistry improving prediction somewhat. Results of the study should be used to improve advising of students, and provide direction in developing intervention strategies to help the underprepared. An extensive list of reference is appended.

The remedial/developmental model was accepted by the faculty as a means of preserving the quality of academic instruction while addressing the needs of underprepared students. The students in the course expressed an openness  about their deficiencies as learners and a willingness to focus on overcoming these inadequacies.

The main goals of the program were to identify these students and to stimulate them to participate in their own learning process so that they would have a better chance to realize their potential. This was to be accomplished by offering remedial instruction, establishing a drop-in center, and providing Saturday and weekend experiences for the students. These students were compared to a control group of students who were not in the program. The findings of the evaluation were the following: (1) students who completed the program were more likely to be  minorities than control group students; (2) absenteeism decreased among program students; (3) student attitudes and the number of suspensions among program students showed no difference; and (4) reading scores were improved by the program.

It concludes that while most Americans have experienced progressively higher living standards in recent decades, an underclass group has emerged without the wherewithal to support itself or improve its economic situation. Government policy has played a role in creating this state of affairs. This suggests that reform of welfare policy should take a high place in the agenda of policymakers in the near future. The major themes of the study are the following: (1) income is the best measure of economic progress and prosperity; (2) people respond actively to incentives in making economic decisions; (3) often public policy has led to results far different than what was  intended, because incentive effects were not sufficiently heeded in initial policy determinations; and (4) the major cause of economic inequality in the United States is variation in labor force participation. Any meaningful change in the system should reduce the debilitating disincentive effects on work in order to induce voluntary enhanced labor force participation. (Author/PS)",

        "description":"The number of dropouts is increasing and is particularly high in urban areas and among minority students. Dropouts earn less over their lifetimes, are in poorer health, and do not have the technological skills needed for newly-developing jobs. The federal government, the private sector, and educators have made serious commitments to bring down the dropout rate. In this two-part document the Urban Superintendents Network presents possible solutions to this problem. Part One discusses the dropout problem and presents the superintendents' action plan for lowering the dropout rate. Part Two describes six strategies that the superintendents believe hold promise for keeping at-risk students in school. The recommendations are the following: (1) anti-dropout programs should intervene  early in the lives and school careers of at-risk youngsters; (2) a positive school climate must be created in schools with adequate personnel; (3) school districts must set high attendance, academic, and discipline expectations; (4) strong teachers should be developed and hired; (5) districts should provide a broad range of instructional programs tailored for at-risk students; and (6) all people, organizations, and institutions should organize collaborative efforts to improve schools and lower the dropout rate. The superintendents plan to form six action groups to address the problem and to share information. The report also includes descriptions of effective dropout programs; a bibliography, and a list of contact persons and agencies. (VM)",

        "description":"A study sought to determine what factors influenced Ohio Cooperative Extension Service county agents to leave their jobs (particularly the factor of job performance level) as measured by supervisory rating and self-rating techniques. Additionally, the study sought to determine relationships between variables and to determine the levels of those variables as they existed in the population being studied. All 244 Ohio Cooperative Extension Service county agents under contract March 1, 1985, were surveyed via a mailed questionnaire, with additional data supplied through an investigation of their personnel files. A variety of relationships among factors were found. Overall, the study concluded that Ohio Cooperative Extension Service county agents generally had low intentions of  leaving their present jobs. They experienced moderate amounts of overall job satisfaction, satisfaction with supervision and the work itself, high satisfaction with co-workers, and fairly low amounts of satisfaction with promotion and pay. They perceived themselves to be high performers, and their supervisors generally agreed. Agents tended to reward themselves intrinsically for good performance, but they did not see that the rewards given them by the organization were necessarily contingent upon their performance level. Lower performers had higher intentions of leaving the job than did higher performers, and the self-rating of job performance was more closely associated with intention to leave the job than was supervisor rating of job performance. Other predictors of intention to leave  the job were overall job satisfaction, satisfaction with co-workers, and age. Recommendations were made for improving job satisfaction through feedback, promotion policies, creating cooperative teams of co-workers, and other methods. (KC)",

The study included four populations of Ohio State University graduates receiving four-year degrees between 1978 and 1983. Samples were taken of 105 agricultural education graduates, 160 agriculture graduates, 155 education majors, and 1,494 other bachelor's degree graduates. Data on the graduates were gathered from university records. Some of the results and conclusions of the study were as follows: (1) this study did not support the hypothesis suggested by other studies that agriculture education graduates  ranked lower academically than other graduates; (2) agricultural education graduates earned scores on the English, mathematics, and composite portions of college entrance tests that were not significantly different from secondary education graduates; and (3) neither the high school percentile rank nor the high school grade point average earned by agricultural education graduates was significantly different from that earned by secondary education graduates, although the secondary education graduates did have higher scores in the humanities, social sciences, and specific content-area courses. The data clearly indicate that agricultural education graduates are as academically inclined as other education and university graduates. The study suggested that the lower esteem in which some  professors hold agricultural education graduates implies an image problem that should be the concern of agricultural educators. (KC)",

The questionnaire developed and mailed to 119 Texas postsecondary institutions was returned by 64 public two-year, public four-year, and private four-year institutions. Only 24 of these indicated that they had a nontraditional program. Four-year public institutions were the most conservative category of institution. Four-year private and two-year public institutions had more aggressive postures toward nontraditional education. Programs at four-year private institutions generally had most of the nontraditional  characteristics, granted more credit for nontraditional forms of learning, had lower residency requirements, and sponsored most of the military base programs. Two-year public institutions seemed to be particularly sensitive to the access issues of the adult students and were experimenting with greater utilization of credit for nontraditional forms of learning and instructional television. The conservative approach of public four-year institutions seemed to be the product of state regulatory policies that hamper creative academic adaptations to serve the adult clientele. (YLB)",

        "description":"Various terms have been used to describe adult educators, including change agents, facilitators, helpers, leaders, and most typically, teachers. Although advocacy is defined by Webster as the act of pleading the cause of another, or in defending a particular proposal or future, it is obviously a term that can be used to champion the cause of human and societal development through adult education programs and organizations. In advocacy for the adult as learner, the emphasis is on the act of promoting constructive behavioral changes in adults that enhance the affective dimension of the adult as a learner and encourage a greater degree of personal autonomy and direction over subsequent learning and development behavior and experiences. Successful advocacy results in the ability to  reach previously unattainable learning and development objectives and the ability to recycle existing and newly acquired knowledge and skills in new areas of application beyond those originally perceived and commonly used. A typology of advocacy for empowerment of the adult as learner includes Type One--Personal Advocacy (a one-on-one relationship in which the advocate provides guidance, counseling, or facilitative behavior with one or more adults); Type Two--Direct Advocacy (in which advocates not having the proximity of personal contact are aware of and identify with individuals or groups of adults as learners from their professional or societal positions); and Type Three--Indirect Advocacy (in which the advocate is not identified as such and has no relationship with individuals or  groups of adults as learners who ultimately benefit from the empowerment process).

The Summer Chautauqua Program was conducted to model program evaluation techniques for students of adult and continuing education, to provide data for program planners relative to the maintenance and revision of the summer program, and to attempt to substantiate currently accepted understanding of why adults pursue or resume formal learning efforts. The program involved a two-week, intensive format; pre-class assignments; planned out-of-class activities; considerable in-class discussion; and a variety of other features. Study participants were divided into two random groups with each group receiving a separate questionnaire. One questionnaire pertained to the summer  program and the other pertained to the general program of studies in adult and continuing education. Results showed relatively high ratings for all aspects of the summer program. The term of greatest preference for enrollment in courses was summer; winter was the term of lowest preference. Over 50 percent of the respondents indicated that one reason for enrolling in courses in adult and continuing education was to assist in some life transition or change. Teaching principles that emerged from this study included opportunity for student input, quality of instruction, opportunity for study interaction, clarity of program information, and supportive out-of-class activities.

        "description":"Because money management is often a problem for lower-level military personnel, a resource management educational program called Money Sense was started by the University of California Cooperative Extension at Edwards Air Force Base in 1985. Volunteers for Money Sense were recruited at the base; they attended eight sessions on teaching techniques and a variety of financial management subjects. From the fall of 1985 to the fall of 1986, a total of 47 Money Sense Advisors (MSAs) were trained. The MSAs provided money management help to about 300 clients; 60 of them were available to complete an interview about the Money Sense program. Of the 60 persons interviewed, most were married, had an average of two dependents, and had been in the military 4.1 years. Only 25 percent had two  wage earners in the family; 56 percent reported income of less than $15,000 per year. Half of the respondents felt they had no money problems before participating in Money Sense, whereas 44 percent reported having had financial problems at least monthly. After participation in the Money Sense program, 68 percent reported no money problems, whereas the rest felt they had problems rarely or no more than monthly. About 90 percent of the respondents believed their current financial status to be good or excellent. Only 35 percent of the clients interviewed had a budget before Money Sense compared with 93 percent who had a budget after the program. More than one-fourth had reduced the proportion of monthly income spent on credit. The findings of the study indicate that clients can be enabled to  change their resource management behavior in a positive direction and that these changes can be lasting. The Money Sense program is being used at other military installations. (KC)",

        "description":"A preliminary study was conducted to draw a profile of older adults who participate in educational programs on college campuses and to identify those older people who are not being served. The college and university programs surveyed in this study were drawn from a list of College Centers for Older Learners (CCOL) recently described in a publication issued through the Institute for Lifelong Learning. From 92 CCOLs contacted through a mailed survey, 56 usable surveys were returned (61 percent). The survey form requested data on numbers of participants over 55, their ages, income levels, marital status, housing arrangements, racial or ethnic composition, employment status, status of health, and education. Although not all of the responding centers had data on all of the dimensions  surveyed, the results obtained do confirm earlier studies. The older people being served in college programs are usually better educated, retired, in fair to good health, and in the middle to high income brackets. Those individuals not being served by these programs can be characterized as minorities, people in poor or frail health, of low income, poorly educated, and lacking adequate transportation. In an open-ended question at the conclusion of the questionnaire, several respondents stated that many elders do not participate because they are not comfortable on college campuses or are fearful of academic participation. However, one statement summed up many others: although people with little education and near poverty level or who do not feel comfortable in an educational background  usually do not enroll, when such people do enroll, most enjoy the experience.

        "description":"At the higher education level, some educators saw individualization of the college curriculum as a means for personal development and a method for empowering the students and the faculty. Notions of adult education appeared to reinforce the strong movement to individualize the college curriculum. The development of contract learning pulled together the differing ideologies and concerns of educating adults. New York's Empire State College, an entirely contract-based institution, and other such colleges faced the following problems in implementing contract-based programs: programs were often highly conventional and similar to traditional ones and programs were highly specialized with little breadth. Interrelated reasons for these seemingly antithetical situations were that many  adults attend college simply for the credentials, these students do not perceive themselves as voluntary learners, students may want to dictate what they will learn, and many students are ill-prepared academically or not well-directed. Faculty issues and the general process orientation of the individualized approach compounded these problems. Adults who sought flexibility of access rather than content reshaped the original purposes of programs such as Empire State. The result of assuming too much about the learner was programs that did not empower students but left them feeling shortchanged or manipulated. (YLB)",

Because it was found that many citizens are unprepared for such leadership roles, the extension service developed a program to educate adults for extension education leadership. The program provided training in needed knowledge and skills, opportunities for significant leadership roles, and reinforcement and recognition for assuming leadership. Thus far, the change in the way in which the extension program is operated has been progressing smoothly, and community involvement has increased in extent and quality. The increased citizen involvement in  extension activities that has resulted from the leadership training has had significant effects on the state's extension program. In some counties, the community members who have joined county extension committees are urging the professional staff to accept the concept of clustering county committees into groups and to take a more cooperative approach. It is also believed that citizen participation has been an important factor in the extension program's movement from a university subject matter emphasis to an issue emphasis. The leadership training, although designed to make adults assume a more active leadership role within the extension program, has also appeared to encourage many program participants to become more involved in other community activities as well.

        "description":"The Tennessee State University and Community College System is focusing special attention on a particular population of nontraditional students--academically underprepared adults. In 1985, the State Board of Regents implemented the Academic Assessment and Placement Program (AAPP) at the system's universities and two-year colleges. The entry-level holistic assessment and placement program was developed to ensure all students seeking admission to these institutions a reasonable chance of success in college. The Regents established the Remedial/Developmental Studies Program to provide a second chance for recent high school graduates and returning adults to acquire basic academic competencies that are needed for college-level work. The program is based on the mastery learning  concept. For the two completed years of the program, it has been successful in increasing retention rates for both traditional and adult students. The State Board of Regents also attempted to reach out to the underprepared adult population by providing expanding opportunities for adults to complete General Educational Development (GED) preparation and testing through the College System. This program expansion is expected to increase the number of Tennesseans eligible for collegiate enrollment as well as employment opportunities. It is expected that the number of persons served will significantly increase in the future as more adults now in literacy and basic skills programs continue their education through the GED. Such programs are needed if colleges are to maintain their enrollments as  the population ages. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the career and professional development activities of postsecondary and adult vocational teachers without degrees in education during their first five years in vocational education. Data were gathered five years after course completion from people who enrolled in a course required for licensure as vocational teachers. The primary reason people took the course was to obtain initial vocational licensure. The two most important factors that attracted people to become vocational educators were their desire to share what they know and to work with students. Postsecondary and adult groups differed significantly on a number of the factors that attracted them to vocational education. The majority had prior teaching experience, participated in professional development  activities, and felt there were employment advantages to having a degree in vocational education. Significant differences were found between the adult and postsecondary groups in the numbers of courses taken in instructional methodology and vocational education and in the amount of related work experience. Five years after entering vocational education, only 51.8 percent of the group was still in vocational education. The most important reasons for leaving were career advancement and job elimination.

To develop the inventory, the General Accounting Office (GAO) surveyed 71 federal organizations having 5,000 or more employees. The GAO used a questionnaire that asked agency officials to identify their HRM practices and to indicate those they considered innovative. The GAO also visited sites, reviewed agency documentation of selected practices, and interviewed officials from 47 of the 71 agencies. The document consists of a cover letter and five appendixes. A detailed discussion of the study objectives, scope, and methodology is found in Appendix I. Appendix II presents the overall results of the survey and describes (1) the frequency  of implementation of HRM practices across the federal government; (2) the percentage of HRM practices that any single agency implemented; and (3) the HRM practices that agencies believe contribute significantly to operations. Appendix III describes briefly 15 examples of these practices. Appendix IV contains the inventory of innovative HRM practices that agency officials reported using. Appendix V defines HRM practices.

        "description":"The U.S. Government Accounting Office (GAO) evaluated how well divisions in the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy and the Veterans Administration have implemented performance appraisal systems for blue-collar employees. The study found that in the four agencies visited, performance appraisal systems were in place; however, problems existed, particularly with performance standards. The GAO reviewed 84 performance plans applicable to 5,843 employees at the locations visited and found that one or more of the standards in 54 of these plans were not clear, did not distinguish among all levels of performance, or were based on uncontrollable external factors. In addition, some of these standards were not used to measure performance and in some cases were inappropriately based  on personal traits. To a lesser extent, problems were also noted in communicating standards to employees in a timely manner and providing employees with performance feedback. Although agencies have conducted evaluations of performance appraisal systems and have identified deficiencies, evaluations by local authorities, where closer contact with the work and the standards for performing the work exist, were generally not occurring. The GAO recommended that the Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and Navy and the Administrator of Veterans Affairs ensure that local authorities conduct evaluations of performance appraisal systems and correct deficiencies. All of the agencies agreed with the findings and said they were planning activities to address the shortcomings identified in the report;  however, specific plans were often lacking. (KC)",

During the project, the program administrators planned to purchase computer software appropriate for middle school students, to have counselors and students  review the software, and to make the software and other career resources available to interested educators. As a result, 23 software programs, 5 sets of printed materials, and 2 videotapes were purchased, and 80 percent of the purchases were reviewed. Since the project was completed, one school system has visited the center, and two Virginia systems and two out-of-state systems have requested information. State conference workshops will be held in the career centers at a high school and a junior high, and evaluation of the software will continue. Recommendations were made to establish additional regional centers.

The primary objectives of the study were to identify ways to improve vocational education planning through greater involvement of trade associations in ways other than as suppliers of labor market information and to determine whether national or state trade associations are likely sources of useful labor market information for vocational education planning. Approximately 100 candidate trade associations were identified from a preliminary survey of state directors of vocational education. Of these, five national trade associations were selected for on-site case studies, and 53 state trade associations were selected for abbreviated case studies that were conducted by telephone. The case studies  resulted in findings dealing with the following aspects of the role of trade associations in vocational education: current operational activities conducted by trade associations in support of vocational education planning and programming and the prospects of their future involvement; present and prospective initiation of linkages between trade associations and vocational education; current and prospective practices for the planning and operational phases of trade associations-vocational education linkage activities; benefits of trade associations linkages with vocational education; and facilitators and inhibitors influencing planning, conduct, and outcomes of trade association-sponsored activities.

Irrigation of U.S. acreage declined 5.6 million acres between 1978 and 1984 to 44.7 million acres. In 1982 irrigated acreage represented 6 percent of the 820 million acres of cropland and pastureland harvested in the contiguous United States. These irrigated lands accounted for about 13 percent of all cropland harvested in 1982, however, and thus contributed 32 percent of the total value of the crops produced that year. Irrigation was used on the entire rice crop; 60 to 70 percent of vegetable, potato, and orchard crops; 53 percent of the sugar beet crop; and 35 percent of the cotton  crop. Other crops were irrigated in proportions ranging from 4 to 17 percent. The four western regions (Northern Plains, Southern Plains, the Rocky Mountain, and Pacific areas) accounted for almost 85 percent of all irrigated land. The most rapid increase in the use of irrigation occurred in the Lake States and Corn Belt, where irrigated acreage nearly doubled between 1974 and 1982. Other areas in which the use of irrigation was increasing at a rapid rate included Appalachia (67 percent), the Southeast (73 percent), the Delta States (78 percent), and the Northern Great Plains (52 percent). Irrigation declined 14 percent in the Southern Plains. As of 1984, about 60 percent of all irrigation systems were gravity flow systems, with the remainder being either sprinkler or drip systems.

        "description":"A study assessed the level of workers' knowledge of their pension plan's provisions related to early and normal retirement. The data used were from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances. The survey, which was based on a nationwide sample of more than 3,800 households and more than 1,000 public and private pension plans that covered them, asked the respondents if they would be eligible for early retirement and when they would first be eligible for full retirement benefits (normal retirement) or reduced retirement benefits (early retirement). The following inferences were drawn on the basis of the data collected in the 1983 survey: (1) over 40 percent of the 22 million workers in pension plans offering early retirement were either incorrect or did not know about their eligibility  for early retirement benefits; (2) about 75 percent of the 12 million workers who were correct about being eligible for early retirement benefits were either incorrect or did not know about their eligibility data; (3) workers who would be eligible for early retirement were from 3 to 17 times more likely to know about their eligibility than those who would not be eligible; (4) having had education beyond high school and being more than 5 years from eligibility for early retirement were two factors associated with a higher likelihood of being correct about one's own retirement benefits; and (5) women were from 2.5 to 5 times as likely as men to say that they did not know about their early retirement eligibility.

During the first year of the Learning Lab's operation, three evenly divided groups of learners appeared to use its facilities and equipment--conferees, faculty/staff, and members of the local community. The conferees appeared most interested in materials about management skills, whereas local community members seemed most interested in computer training (especially for the IBM personal computer). The most pervasive  first impression among those using the Learning Lab for the first time was that it would be a career counseling and testing service. Both conferees and community clients tended to spend most of their time with instructional materials delivered through computer-assisted instruction or a limited interactive video format. Seventy-seven percent of the conferees and 66 percent of the community clients indicated that the freedom to set one's own learning pace was the most valuable feature of the instruction offered at the center. The learning patterns observed among the users of the Learning Lab appear to confirm existing adult education research, which asserts that adult learning resources should reflect the documented interests and needs of the population being served and should offer  learners the opportunity to control and shape their own learning efforts.

A study was conducted to examine the role that abuse plays in the lives of women and to investigate the relationship between alcohol and violence. Data were collected from 35 recovering female alcoholics and 35 nonalcoholic women on their sexual experience and dysfunction; sexual orientation; and physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Compared to the nonalcoholic group, the alcoholic group reported a wider variety of sexual abuse perpetrators, more instances of abuse, more multiple incidents of abuse, and longer duration of sexual abuse. Alcoholics also reported more incidents of incest and rape. Although there was no significant difference between the number of alcoholic and nonalcoholic  women reporting physical abuse, there was a different quality in the abuse described, with alcoholic women reporting more instances of physical abuse, of greater frequency and variety, and of a more violent nature than the abuse reported by the nonalcoholic women. Alcoholic women also reported more emotional abuse than did nonalcoholic women. One issue in alcoholism treatment is the need for the client to deal with the past. It is crucial that the issue of abuse experienced by alcoholic women be dealt with in alcoholism treatment. If the staff members are not trained for this specialized area of counseling, then resources for referral must be developed. (NB)",

Subjects were 35 undergraduates who were screened, matched, and tested as singles or dyads during which time they thought aloud. Problems included mazes, Piagetian logical problems in abstract or everyday modes, a philosophical problem, and cryptarithmetic. Data were analyzed using t-tests and analyses of variance. The results revealed that performance on some problems was influenced by partner status, and that respondents' performance varied across the problem set. The hypothesis that goal clarity would be associated with better performance was supported among the logical problems but  not for the maze problems. The hypothesis that Piagetian logical problems would appear more difficult the more interpersonal/everyday and the less abstract the context, was supported. Tests of the hypotheses concerning style of problem solving have not been completed. Results are discussed in terms of cognition and information processing theory. Applications are made to lifespan development and to clinical problems. (Author/NB)",

Three models have been used to explain the occurrence of physical aggression among these patients. The Personological model emphasizes the role of dispositional variables; the Social-Environmental model stresses the importance of the physical environment and the social organization; and the Interpersonal model focuses on the nature and quality of the patient-staff interaction. A study was conducted to identify the key interactional factors, identified by staff members of a large state mental hosipital, that contribute to or effectively prevent physical aggression. Skilled nursing staff members, selected by their supervisors, were interviewed about interactions and  communication in two cases of potential violence between patients and staff, one in which violence occurred and the other in which violence was prevented. The interview data indicate the importance of interpersonal factors in the incidence of aggressive behavior among psychiatric inpatients and suggest that the application of communication skills in a supportive context, organized on the basis of mutual respect and the assumption of patient competence is a major deterrent to violence in psychiatric hospitals.

        "description":"A family planning clinic which was part of a large public maternity hospital in Salvador Bahia, Brazil received a grant to expand its services and to evaluate a service model focusing on client counseling and education. The counseling, education, and service provision process included individual pre-consultation with a nurse, group education and discussion, a medical examination/consultation, and a post-consultation interview. The family planning service program experienced political problems because family planning research programs, which depended on maintaining a certain client load, were losing potential clients to the clinic. As a result, the service program was forced to stop admitting clients and thus the program could only be evaluated for a 3-month period. The impact of  counseling and education through increases in knowledge and user satisfaction was investigated by administration of an open-ended questionnaire to 115 new and follow-up patients. Findings indicated that: (1) users were satisfied with the service; (2) group education was more cost efficient than individual counseling; (3) the patient flow model was inefficient; (4) the length of the process was inconvenient for clients; (5) sexuality education was welcomed; (6) intrauterine devices were favored by 60% of clients with only 5% choosing oral contraceptives; and (7) only 10 unplanned pregnancies occurred among 1,776 clients during the 18-month project. Apparently the linkage of information on sexuality and use of family planning methods led to the program's popularity. (ABL)",

A review of the relevant empirical literature yielded mixed conclusions. The studies which examined moral development offered little evidence of a relationship between self-actualization and moral behavior. Studies reviewed on fear of death suggested a significant correlation between a positive attitude toward death and self-actualization. While a positive relationship with others was found to be significantly related to self-actualization, there were only two studies available which addressed the issue, thereby limiting the  confidence which can be placed in the results. Mixed results were found in the studies examining self-actualization and anxiety with findings supporting either the value of anxiety in personal development or its incompatability with actualization. Finally, studies examining the relationship between religious participation and self-actualization found that college students who attended church infrequently tended to have higher levels of self-actualization. Future research might take concepts known to be biblical and address their relationship to self-actualization. (NB)",

A search of the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) database for the years 1984-1986 produced only 15 items indexed under terms related to school counseling or the school counselor's role. Ideally a database would specify \"what works,\" but the literature reflects approaches and strategies used in particular school situations which are not necessarily adoptable by other schools. However, certain school activities, practices, and emphases have been positively associated with improvement in school retention and reduction in school dropouts. These strategies and the counselor's role in them include: (1) promotion of daily school  attendance; (2) encouragement of parental participation in school learning activities; (3) strong and consistent school leadership; (4) clearly stated and widely disseminated classroom and school goals; (5) help for each student to establish and progress toward personally meaningful career goals; (6) placement of a high priority on school resources for the early elementary grades; (7) insurance that students stay at grade level; (8) interfacing school and community resources; (9) provision of a caring and mentoring environment for all students; (10) assistance for students to develop effective learning and study skills; (11) establishment of a school climate where achievement is respected and rewarded; and (12) recognizing and acting upon the interrelatedness of student self-esteem and  successful school performance.

Although the sexes agreed that men take less responsibility in the home than is ideal, not surprisingly men perceived more present equality in this area than women did and women, but not men, anticipated significant change in the future.  Similarly, women perceived less present equity in the areas of pay and job opportunity than did men, and although both sexes were guardedly optimistic about the prospects for continued strides toward equality in these areas, this was particularly true for women. Neither sex expected complete equality in the foreseeable future. The results are discussed in relation to literature on sex-role attitudes and their relevance to the struggle for sexual equality.

An overview of marketing defines marketing and challenges student service professionals to understand the principles of marketing and to apply them to student services without compromising the integrity of their mission. Five components of an effective marketing plan for student services are discussed: (1) analyzing the life cycle of each service; (2) developing procedures to eliminate \"terminal\" services which cannot be saved; (3) identifying consumer needs and reactions; (4)  planning strategically; and (5) educating effectively. Attachments comprising the bulk of the document include forms to track student services on a life-cycle continuum, guidelines on the student development office review from Seminole Community College, a new student survey, a faculty evaluation of services survey, an advising evaluation form for students, an overview of strategic planning at Seminole Community College's Student Services Unit, and an outline of the marketing/strategic planning model currently used at the college.

        "description":"In 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published the Guidelines on Sexual Harassment, specifying that sexual harassment is a kind of sex discrimination under Title VII and is an unlawful employment practice. While the determination of the behaviors that constitute sexual harassment would enable employees to write more effective policy statements, research has shown individual differences in the perception of sexual harassment. This study used policy capturing to examine sexual harassment judgments of 15 Equal Employment Opportunity Officers at midwestern colleges and universities and 79 university students. Subjects were given 80 incidents of possible sexual harassment and were asked to make judgments on each as to whether the incident represented a case of  sexual harassment and whether EEOC charges should be filed. The results revealed that subjects were moderately consistent in their sexual harassment judgments and in their judgments as to whether or not formal charges should be filed, and they made similar decisions for both sets of judgments, attending most to three cues: Coercion, Victim's Reaction, and Job Consequences. These findings support the claim that experts and naive observers are very similar in what information they use and in how consistently they use that information to make judgments about sexual harassment.

Having alumni meet with potential students may be the best use of alumni by admission officers. Alumni can meet with prospective students in a variety of contexts. When meeting with students at a function that may involve other alumni, however, alumni must never lose sight of a focus on prospective applicants. Through writing letters, making telephone calls, or visiting schools, alumni can initiate recruiting contacts with prospective students and can familiarize the students with a college they may not have considered. When a college admission counselor is sent to unfamiliar cities to recruit, alumni living in those cities can serve as  support personnel for the counselor in his recruiting efforts. Most active alumni networks involve alumni in at least three aspects of admission work: recruitment, interviewing, and yield strategy. Besides logistical support and contact through recruiting and interviewing, alumni can help through organizing and hosting events such as yield parties. Alumni can be an invaluable asset and a strong selling-point of the college to prospective students. Admission officers are encouraged to use their alumni in their admission efforts. (NB)",

It was hypothesized that the satisfaction with achieving the possible self will be higher the more the person has focused on this possible self and the more emotionally involved the person has been with the possible self in the past. These hypotheses were tested in a 10-year panel study of 99 medical doctors which investigated the influence of long-term self-relevant goals (possible selves) on subjective well-being after achieving these goals. The results provided support for the first hypothesis: the degree to which students had focused on becoming a physician in their first year of medical school significantly predicted  satisfaction with medicine as a career after achieving this possible self 10 years later. The second hypothesis, however, was not supported: the degree to which these students were emotionally affected by these possible selves when starting medical school had no influence on their later satisfation with medicine as a career. The findings support the hypothesis that the two aspects of possible selves, their cognitive structure and their affective valence, function independently. These results provide evidence for the psychological significance of the concept of possible selves. (NB)",

        "description":"Gender differences in academic achievement of students in the medical school at the University of Michigan were investigated in this study. Observed achievement differences were attributed to gender differences in values which influence student motivation. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) that men place more importance on mastery-related issues, while women have stronger person-related and social values; (2) that men will do better in purely knowledge-based achievement tests, and that women will do better in person-related tasks such as clinical performance; and (3) that women's achievement should be predicted better by taking person-related values into account, while men's achievement should be predicted better by using mastery-related values as predictors. Data from 885 male  and 271 female medical students of the entering classes of 1976 through 1981 were analyzed. The results supported all three hypotheses. Findings can be interpreted as clear evidence of the importance of affective factors, especially values, in explaining gender differences in academic achievement. One's achievement reflects the fit between the person's cognitive and affective make-up and the demands of the environment. (NB)",

Early onset or long-term alcohol abusers are abusers with long-standing behavioral problems considered well known to the social service delivery system. Late-life onset elderly alcohol abusers are those whose drinking problems began in the later years, after age 50, often in response to stresses associated with the aging process. This study compared the drinking histories and current drinking patterns of these two types of elderly alcohol abusers who were admitted to a behavioral day treatment program. Two groups of elderly were selected: 26 for each group, each consisting of 16 males and 10 females. Information from the Gerontology Alcohol Project Drinking Profile and several psychosocial assessments was used to compare the two  groups. Results indicated that individuals in the early onset group were younger, more likely to have had previous alcohol treatment, more likely to have changed residence, drank more, were intoxicated more often, and experienced more emotional problems than those in the late onset group. Late-life onset subjects had more education, higher income, and greater life satisfaction than did early onset subjects. Despite these differences, depression and loneliness appeared to be common antecedents to problem drinking behavior in the elderly. (Author/NB)",

A study was conducted to examine the sensitivity of the self-reported reliance on nonverbal behaviors, as assessed by the Verbal/Nonverbal Reliance Questionnaire (VNRQ), to the actual changes in nonverbal behaviors. Two stimulus tapes, one tape containing counselor responsive and the other counselor unresponsive nonverbal behaviors, were developed and shown to 127 high school students. The students rated the expertness, trustworthiness, and attractiveness of the counselor, and indicated the degree to which they relied on nonverbal cues (eye contact, smile, voice, and gestures) in making their judgments. The results  indicated that participants who reported a higher reliance, in contrast to a lower reliance, on nonverbal cues showed a greater sensitivity to changes in nonverbal behaviors. The findings suggest that self-reported reliance on nonverbal behavior, as measured by the VNRQ, may be a sensitive and convenient method of obtaining information about the contribution of nonverbal behavior in a client's perception of the counselor.

        "description":"Many studies which have investigated the differences between decided and undecided subjects have assumed homogeneity of both subsets, but results of these studies do not justify such a assumption. This study attempted to identify, multidimensionally, types of vocationally undecided college students. Data on 11 variables from 276 undecided undergraduate students were entered into a cluster analysis. Data from the cluster analysis suggest that the optimal partioning of the data was obtained with a five-cluster solution. Analyses of variance and a chi-square analysis using variables not included in the clustering process provided evidence of the validity of found clusters. To assess the reliability of the clustering process, the total sample was split into two subsamples and a  five-cluster solution was imposed on each of the subsamples. The resulting clusters were compared to the clusters of the total sample and to the findings of a former, similar study. These comparisons provide support for the reliability of three of the five clusters. The emergence of these clusters suggests a multidimensional perspective of vocational decidedness with apparent implications for differential treatment. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Given that traditional societies provide women with clearly defined roles, married women in traditional communities might experience less depression than women who have conflicting role expectations. To examine this issue, 43 Lubavitch Hassidic Jewish women from two northeastern communities were interviewed concerning their satisfaction with various aspects of their lives and were administered the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (Radloff, 1974). The two groups' life satisfaction and depression levels were compared to each other and the two groups' pooled responses were compared to national norms. It was hypothesized that the Lubavitch group as a whole would be more satisfied with life and less depressed than the American norms because of the Lubavitch  lifestyle and ideology. The results showed that Lubavitch women's life satisfaction in general was higher than that of the national norms, though satisfaction with some specific areas of their lives proved to be lower than the norm. The Lubavitch women were also found to be less depressed than the normative sample of American women. (Author/NB)",

A study was conducted to investigate the attitudes of college students toward seeking professional help before and after taking a course in abnormal psychology to determine whether exposure to the purposes and methods of clinical psychology would produce more positive attitudes in students. Forty students enrolled in an Abnormal Psychology course and 29 students in a Psychology of Consciousness course completed the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Help Scale during the first class meeting and again during the last class meeting. Students in the Abnormal Psychology class showed significantly more positive attitudes toward seeking help for  psychological problems at the end of the semester than at the beginning. Students enrolled in the Psychology of Consciousness class showed no significant difference in attitude. Males were significantly less positive than females in their attitudes toward seeking help. These findings have implications for instructors of psychology courses. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"The FamiliesFirst project in Davis, California is a child abuse prevention project designed to keep abused children safely at home. During the first year of operation, FamiliesFirst provided in-home prevention services to 59 children in 26 families referred by county Child Protective Services as an alternative to out-of-home placement. Therapists, carrying a caseload of two families each, provided intensive treatment in the families' homes for a 4- to 6-week period. A comparison group of 24 Child Protective Service-referred families with 49 children received usual county services. Families were interviewed at intake and again one year later. The two groups were evaluated on cost, on whether of not the children stayed at home, and on psychological measures of family functioning.  The results revealed that abusive and neglectful families who received in-home services were able to keep their children home more often than were families who received traditional services alone. The in-home intervention did not put experimental group children at more risk for further abuse or neglect, as measured by a need for later placement, than children in the comparison group. The one-year follow-up data indicated that the goals of reducing out-of-home placement and lowering placement costs were being met. (Author/NB)",

The second section of the paper offers assessments of the test from a dozen reviewers, five of whom thought the test was not useful or seriously flawed due to, among other things, (1) a lack of a description in the manual for how the test can be used diagnostically, (2) sex-role stereotyping in the test, and (3) lack of evidence of attempts to measure inference, logic, or analysis. The positive reviews in this section rated  the test as useful in that, among other things, it offers a wide variety of interpretive scores, presents directions and interpretations of scores clearly in the manual, and makes alternate forms of the test available. Concluding remarks suggest that the WRMT is not what the author promised it would be, although it may have value as an initial screening test. (Seven references are included.) (JC)",

        "description":"Noting that the use of captions in television newscasts has grown from simple labeling of newsmakers to more complicated titling of graphics and enumerating important points in a script, a study examined the extent to which captioning assisted viewers in learning from different types of television news stories. Subjects, 100 undergraduate journalism students, viewed news stories in a quiet classroom. They first viewed a dummy story followed by a brief distractor test meant to purge short-term memory and prevent rehearsal of story information. Subjects then viewed actual news stories of two types, concrete/picture stories and abstract/word stories, in which the caption variable was manipulated. For each news story, subjects identified whether freeze frames they were shown had  appeared in the dummy story and answered multiple choice questions (testing both recall and understanding) about the content. The process was repeated until five more stories had been viewed. Results indicated that captions did improve recall for the abstract/word stories, but impeded understanding in the concrete/picture stories. Captions may have impeded understanding of the picture stories by distracting attention from the visuals. On the other hand, because word stories do not lend themselves to reinforcing visualization, cues like captions serve as reinforcements. This implies that news producers would do best to omit captions from stories with strong visual content and use caption graphics to clarify abstract, word oriented stories.

        "description":"A participant observation study of a primary grade classroom, in which three first grade students were selected as case study subjects, illustrates the range of workstyles of beginning writers. Primary grade teachers are often concerned that their students are not producing writing comparable with their capabilities, but educators' conceptions of what very young writers should be doing are too narrow, not accounting for children's varied workstyles. The three subjects, a mixed Black/Anglo boy, a Hispanic boy, and a White girl were observed as they wrote and drew pictures in their journals over a year. The first boy relied heavily upon social contact as he drew, &quot;talking&quot; his stories as he drew and then writing about what he had drawn. He worked at a moderate pace and learned to  spell a number of frequently repeated words. The second boy, interested in writing &quot;adventure stories,&quot; spent much more time producing careful pictures and longer stories that made more narrative sense than the first child's work. The girl produced more stories and pictures than either boy, was careful and neat in her work, but the stories lacked variety, always centering on friends and family. While teachers do need to assess students' workstyles and what they produce, such variety in workstyles suggests that teachers must also be flexible to meet the needs of their students.

The study specifically investigated research considerations including: (1) the teachers' use of response groups; (2) the kinds of response the students give themselves in response groups; and (3) the connection between student response and the teachers' directions to the groups. Subjects, 60 students in two schools in the San Francisco area, were observed for 17 weeks. Data collection consisted of daily videotaping and audiotaping of whole class discussions and of peer response groups, ethnographic note taking, and collection of all writing materials prepared by teachers and students. Results indicated that peer response groups can help students respond to their own work. When talk about content was  initiated, members of the groups encouraged and questioned one another and demonstrated ownership of their writing. However, the students avoided talk that involved evaluation of another student's writing and never played the role of teacher. The students rarely discussed real writing problems and resisted the teacher-directed response on dittoed response sheets. Findings suggest that groups will work differently in different classrooms and with different ages and types of students. In one classroom, peers responded to one another's writing in order to develop evaluative skills, while in the other classroom, the response group functions so that students can collaborate around the discovery of one element of the writing craft, which is then discussed in whole class discussions.

The first part of the paper presents the idea of negotiated meaning and diagrams the relationship between reader and writer and outside forces in such a discourse construction, going on to note some of the implications of seeing reading and writing as acts of cognition. The first subsection discusses cognition and discourse knowledge, while the second subsection examines forces that govern a  reader's response. The third subsection discusses goals of the reader, including deriving a suitable paraphrase from a written work, coming away with a meaningful reading, and looking for a meaning which fits with the author's intention. A final subsection on readers' goals and texts concludes the first part of the paper. The second part of the paper analyzes the protocols of two readers as they verbalize while reading an article and &quot;negotiate&quot; the meaning of what they read.

        "description":"Often regarding the &quot;great books&quot; as too difficult for elementary school age children to comprehend, teachers have given students reading assignments that are less than challenging and have risked causing them to dislike reading because it is relatively uninteresting. However, it is possible to expose very young children to works such as William Shakespeare's plays and poems because of the universal elements contained in the stories, and the fascination children have for his supernatural characters. Children can understand the struggle between parents and children in &quot;King Lear&quot; and come to love the fairies and sprites in &quot;The Tempest&quot; or &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot; The plots of the plays can be offered in a simplified manner using Miles'&quot;Favorite Tales from Shakespeare,&quot; and  Lamb's &quot;Tales from Shakespeare.&quot; In addition, teachers can use several classroom activities that combine history, geography, physical education, and health education by telling them Shakespeare's personal history and explaining that America was being colonized at approximately the same time. Children can also look at a map and locate London and Stratford-upon-Avon, play some of the games or sing some of the songs mentioned in the plays, or try some of the foods from Shakespeare's day. It is likely that such early exposure to Shakespeare's work will make studying Shakespeare in the higher grades much easier.

        "description":"Noting that improvement in rater reliability means eliminating differences among raters, this paper discusses ways to assess writing evaluator reliability and methods for achieving higher levels of interrater reliability. After showing that reliability can be improved two ways--by increasing the number of raters or measurements made, and by increasing the systematic variance among essays relative to error variance--the paper cites common problems in reporting and assessing reliability. The paper then recommends that researchers (1) use an \"analysis of variance\" approach in assessing reliability; (2) indicate the number of independent observations; (3) use a two-way analysis of variance if more than one dimension is rated; (4) use \"repeated measures\" analysis of variance if rating  more than one sample per student; and (5) use an \"intraclass correlation coefficient\" such as coefficient alpha in reports of research, or the \"Pearson r\" when two raters rate one dimension of the sample. Finally, the paper describes methods to increase interrater reliability such as controlling the range and quality of sample papers, specifying the scoring task through clearly defined objective categories, choosing raters familiar with the constructs to be identified, and training the raters in systematic practice sessions. (Formulas for calculating reliability and training procedures for raters are included.) (JG)",

A number of causes have contributed to the decline, including (1) financial constraints in the form of limited student loans, new tax laws affecting student aid and tuition increases; (2) visibility of the profession; (3) certification and licensure requirements, such as the National Examination in Speech-Language Pathology or Audiology; (4) discrimination against nonnative speakers of English; and (5) lack of minority role models in the field. However, ASHA has taken steps to increase  minority recruitment and retention, including conducting studies and publishing reports on minority enrollment, developing booklets, establishing an endowment fund for minority students, and developing recruiting posters and brochures. It is hoped that these efforts and others will slow the current minority brain drain. (Several tables and 11 references are included.) (JC)",

However, it can be demonstrated that the relation between intuition and inference, between justification and explanation, is dialectical and complementary, so that there is no mystery as to (1) how informal reasoning supplies the content of the knowledge articulated in formal reasoning or (2) how formal reasoning explicates the form of the knowledge acquired in informal reasoning. Although inference and insight are contraries in the strong sense, in a weaker sense inference can include the kind of informal inference implicit in a rational assertion, which makes intuition and inference not only compatible but  complementary. In addition, formal inference can be used to make the structure of informal inference explicit, thereby creating further compatibility between informal inference and formal reasoning. Still, discovering a solution to a problem also requires the alternation between justification and explanation of theory; thus inference must be interpreted informally as a dialectic between justification and explanation in the process of achieving equilibrium in the assessment of an argument.

In light of this research, a study focused on 264 randomly selected sixth through tenth grade students in a Tennessee school system to determine the influence of television on their lives. The subjects wrote essays in their English classes describing what they felt to be the influence of television on them, their family, or American society. Essays were coded for both the number and type of influence cited by each student. Results indicated little evidence of clear-cut positive or negative interpretations of the medium's influences. Students identified a wide variety of  both positive and negative effects. At least 90% of the subjects had something positive to say about television, and its entertainment value and usefulness as an information source were frequently cited. Only 62% of the sample identified at least one negative influence of television, and the most frequent criticism was that exposure to television sex, drugs, and violence might negatively affect impressionable viewers' behavior. Multivariate analyses indicated that both IQ and grade level were significantly related to mentions of positive and negative influences of television, with older and brighter students tending to be more negative and cynical about television's effects.

        "description":"Over one million students are enrolled in basic college speech courses each year, providing big business for publishers and authors of speech texts and an opportunity for abuse by faculty who have authored a text or who want to curry favor with a department head who has authored a text. Most multisection basic course programs taught by graduate teaching assistants use textbooks written by the department chairperson, course director or some other significant member of the faculty. A 1980 survey by D. Ochs showed that chairpersons or course directors frequently select course textbooks without consulting faculty and that textbook selection by committees of junior faculty and graduate students is rare. Most courses require a single textbook, that textbook is often selected by a  single person, and most institutions have no stated policy regarding the use of faculty authored textbooks. To counteract some of these ethical and procedural weaknesses, a textbook selection committee should: (1) represent a balance of gender, instructor rank, and philosophical orientation; (2) agree on the objectives of the course, and then on criteria for considering, evaluating and choosing textbooks; (3) ensure that most of the potentially appropriate textbooks are considered by reading reviews, looking at national surveys of textbook use, and actively searching for relevant textbooks; (4) adopt a list of textbooks with varied approaches to meeting the stated course objectives, from which instructors can choose the text for their own section.

        "description":"Since an individual's ability to think critically most often manifests itself orally, research on sex differences should not overlook interpersonal communication styles and patterns in relation to the critical thought process. Any such examination should (1) define critical reasoning as it exists within Western society; (2) examine perceptions of men's and women's abilities to &quot;think&quot; and communicate critically; (3) discuss the ramifications of such perceptions; and (4) suggest ways feminist theory can be integrated into the critical thinking curriculum. Critical thinking has been defined as reasonable reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do. Western society often identifies emotion as an obstacle to effective critical thinking--and women are stereotyped as  behaving more emotionally than men. The first step in a feminist reinterpretation of the critical reasoning mode must be to debunk the myth that women, considered &quot;emotional, non-rational&quot; individuals, are inherently less able than men to think critically. Rather, women have been socialized not to think at all, and even in today's &quot;post-feminist&quot; society, conflicting messages create schizophrenic options for women. A reevaluation of the critical reasoning mode would restore emotion to its rightful place in the critical thinking model, and an even more progressive approach would consider varied models of critical thinking, not necessarily based on Western culture.

Most students do not score well on tests that measure their ability to recognize assumptions, evaluate arguments, or appraise inferences. However, a number of educators believe that it is possible to teach thinking skills, and have suggested that the teaching of thinking skills may take two forms: the pervasive approach or the subject approach. Those who advocate the pervasive model contend that thinking skills should be taught in all subject areas, and that content and intellectual processes are mutually reinforcing. Others believe that thinking is best taught as a distinct subject, and have adopted such approaches as Edward de Bono's CoRT Thinking Program to develop such a subject area.  Although teaching thinking as a discrete subject may remove it from daily, widespread exposure, de Bono argues that thinking will not receive enough focused attention, and generalizable, transferable skills will not be acquired if it is taught across the curriculum. Other researchers of thinking skills emphasize questioning techniques, such as varying levels of questions, waiting for student responses, asking how students arrived at their answer, and stressing comprehension. All agree that such skills are attainable if there is collective, institution-wide commitment to do so. (Four pages of notes are included.) (JC)",

        "description":"The term &quot;visual literacy&quot; generally refers to the interpretation of the formal structure of film or television and carries with it the notion that the interpreter has knowledge of the use of camera angles, lighting, flashbacks, and so forth. However, many visual conventions encountered in movies or television may be interpreted even by a &quot;naive&quot; viewer with no previous experience in media conventions with the use of general cognitive skills. For example, when seeing a character filmed from a low camera angle, even naive viewers can understand that the character is meant to appear powerful because viewers are accustomed to looking up to powerful people. Similarly, viewers' cognitive skills let them interpret subjective and objective shots as the camera switches from a character's  point of view to a view of the scene itself. Finally, viewers are sensitive to contextual cues in nonverbal communication, so that when shots of a character's face are intercut with shots of an object of interest or a listener's face, viewers can perceive nuances of meaning by the juxtaposed images. Both &quot;reality&quot; and exposure to film or television are potential avenues to the interpretation of visual cues, and both sources of interpretational competence conceivably work together, interacting in a complex fashion to help viewers understand what they see.

        "author":["Littlefield, Robert S."],
        "description":"This study was designed to determine forensics students' ability to predict accurately how judges they knew from previous tournaments would rank them in rounds of competitive individual events. The study examined the following hypotheses: (1) contestants can predict how they will do in rounds of competition; and (2) contestants in prepared oral interpretation or public speaking events are more likely to predict successfully their ranking than are contestants in limited preparation events. Fifty-seven contestants of the American Forensic Association's National Individual Events Tournament, all of whom were familiar with a tournament judge, predicted their rank from that judge in a given section of the tournament. After matching their predictions with the actual rankings received  from the judges, a t-test analysis generally indicated a significant difference between prediction and actual rankings, with contestants tending to predict higher rankings than they actually received. Neither hypothesis was supported by the data: students were not good predictors of their rankings, and contestants in prepared events were not better predictors than those in limited preparation events. Moreover, knowing a judge did not help the contestants' ability to predict their ranking. Since one justification for eliminating the low rank and low rating at national forensic tournaments rests on the premise that students can predict when they will receive a low ranking from a judge they know (contributing to psychological distress), this study suggests that the procedure is unnecessary.

        "description":"In 1986 the Dutch government adopted a common core corriculum that would apply to the first 3 years of secondary education. This paper discusses why such a curriculum is necessary, both for improving the individual chances of pupils in the labor market and for society as a whole, and cites the following basic skills as the kernel of the curriculum: (1) language skills; (2) knowledge of one's own history and culture and of other cultures; (3) logical-mathematical knowledge and skills; (4) knowledge of nature and technology; (5) preparation for and orientation toward work; and (6) expressive skills. The proposed subjects of the common core curriculum are listed along with the total number of lessons that should be required over the 3 years. In each subject, the goal is to give  balanced attention to the analytical and theoretical elements; the skills to apply the knowledge in a practical way; and knowledge about the social and cultural aspects of the subject. The decreasing numbers of pupils and the simultaneous introduction of a common core curriculum suggest that the geographically evenly distributed junior vocational and junior secondary schools could specialize in the core curriculum of basic education without relatively high new investments in educational facilities. The report concludes with a graphic display of the structure of full-time education in the Netherlands. (MLF)",

        "description":"This comparative analysis updates the effects on school finance of the Delaware Legislature's passage of a new equalization law in 1984. The formula for allocation of equalization funds was modified by increasing the level of state support and by requiring greater local tax effort for districts to qualify for the funds. Analysis focuses on four variables as indicators of changes in finance: current expense tax rates; local current expense revenues; total current expenses from all revenue sources; and expenditures for salaries among districts. The degree of dispersion among the 16 regular districts before and after legislation is analyzed by comparing each variable in 1983-84 with recent data on the variable. A summary of data analyses includes the following findings: (1) state  funding for equalization purposes over the 3-year phase increased 179 percent over funding in 1983-84; (2) increased funding is provided in large measure to &quot;low wealth&quot; districts; (3) the statute raised the local tax effort among lower paying districts; (4) the total amount of money available from the combined sources and the total current expenses per unit from all revenue sources are more equalized among districts; and (5) average teachers' salaries are more nearly equal among districts. Disparities among districts, on all variables analyzed, were therefore reduced. The statute's only negative effect is the difficulty in projecting local tax rates needed to qualify for full entitlement. The report contains 13 tables; 7 more are included in an appendix. (CJH)",

Using a question-answer format, this report evaluates the program's effectiveness in achieving its goals. The program involved 57 businesses and 44 schools. School needs were documented in one of three ways: needs assessments, school meetings, and teacher surveys. Nearly half of all program coordinators surveyed indicated that their schools had both tutorial and mentor programs. Data from teachers and volunteers suggestd that an earlier start-up time and better communication between volunteers and  teachers would be helpful. The major implementation problem was difficulty matching students with volunteers. Mentorships were delayed because the number of students exceeded the number of volunteers. All coordinators surveyed indicated that they would recommend the Adopt-A-School program for other schools. The Fort Worth program has considerably enriched the district's curriculum without the need for increased taxes. Future recommendations include (1) meeting early in the school year to adopt goals and objectives and (2) clearly defining school coordinator roles. Appendixes include a schools and businesses participant list, the study instruments, observation data from six schools, comments from all participating groups, and a list of Adopt-A-School accomplishments.

Acknowledging the innovative, experimental nature of this endeavor, founders began with a set of common interests, focused mainly on improvement of schooling, and agreed to establish policies and goals as needed. Noting the dearth of information on functioning partnerships, this paper briefly describes several components of the BYU-Public School Partnership, outlines the questions and naturalistic design used to study this collaborative effort, and summarizes a few patterns or hypotheses emerging from this inquiry. The partnership involves a wide spectrum of  activities, persons, organizations, and ideas, including: the five school districts and an entire university; an active governing board; an executive director housed at the university; a coordinating council; six task forces; a new principal preparation program; 13 schools involved in intensive, daily collaboration on instructional and teacher preparation programs; and informal partnering activities at both local and national levels. The bulk of the paper discusses emerging patterns concerning trust, collegiality, symbiotic relationships, an authoritarian governing board, the communication process, institutional versus individual interests, &quot;king pin&quot; individuals' roles, and the evaluation process.

        "description":"As a disciplinary procedure, suspension of students from all school levels has become a serious problem. Because of early maladaptive behavior, many students never receive services they need in order to benefit from their educational experiences. Instead, they are continually suspended, often expelled, and either drop out or are pushed out of school. While school suspension literature focuses mainly on black, poor, and inner-city students, there is a rapidly increasing number of middle class, white, suburban students who are being denied full educational benefits. Suspension also contributes to juvenile delinquency. This paper attempts to collect and analyze suspension data at four predominantly white, middle-class, suburban junior high schools and to make recommendations about  research-based alternatives to suspension for each school. Alternative practices such as in-school suspension, behavior contracts, peer group counseling, work-study alternatives, and others are discussed and their advantages over regular suspension emphasized. The four sources of data used included: guided interviews, document analysis, nondirective interviews, and participant observation. Respondents in all four schools concurred that suspension is ineffective in changing disruptive behavior. Discipline recommendations and alternatives for each school are discussed at length. Several conclusions, including the need for a diversity of alternatives, are briefly summarized. Included are 21 references and 6 data tables. (MLH)",

        "description":"Educational reform commissions and state departments of education across the United States have recommended that would-be administrators spend more time in planned field experiences, internships, and other practica and on-the-job learning activities. Despite this need, systematic research on experiential learning for administrators is remarkably deficient. This paper discusses the rationale for such programs and reviews 40 studies on field-based practica for educational administrators. All these studies employ a descriptive survey design, a single data collection technique (usually a specially designed questionnaire), and a problem-solving, rather than a theory-based, perspective. Most studies describe local experiential learning models developed in university graduate education  programs. The remainder evaluated local models (usually favorably) based on participants' comments or examined structural features of \"successful\" programs. This paper concludes that high quality investigations of practica are nonexistent. Most work is without theoretical base, examines only local issues, is confined largely to internships, and neglects to explore the long-term developmental characteristics of practica. Suggestions are provided for developing a future research agenda to explore mentoring issues, underlying assumptions about \"learning-by-doing,\" the impact of administrative interns on the quality of school organizational life, the effects of practica on candidates' future career success, universities' actual commitment to field experience, and clinical alternatives to  full-time, paid internships.

        "description":"Educational reformists have asserted that collaborative relationships between universities and local education agencies must be firmly established if improvements are to occur in the preservice preparation of school administrators. One collaboration format involves practica and other field-based learning opportunities for aspiring administrators. Although the emerging \"learning by doing\" emphasis might seem appropriate, uncritical and wholesale acceptance of this approach would be a big mistake. This paper identifies some common assumptions about practica and raises additional issues that need to be considered by policy-makers and designers of administrator preparation programs. First the rationale for practica is examined, using the literature on preservice teacher education,  because scant material pertaining to administrator field-based practices is available. Next, the supposed benefits, such as assessing career commitment, refining school goals, practicing in realistic settings, developing competence, and promoting personal professional development, are examined and critiqued for programmatic shortcomings. The same treatment is accorded assumptions related to structure, including implementation and ultimate effectiveness considerations. To counteract the paper's pessimistic observations, several recommendations concerning program control, needed skills, administrator role models, and research needs are provided.

Physical education professionals desperately need evaluation studies to assist them in setting policies and examining policy implementation and outcomes. This paper reviews available literature, identifies methodological issues in policy studies, and provides advice for addressing these issues. The four-point essay: (1) defines &quot;policy&quot;; (2) describes two basic types of policy studies; (3) defines four major issues in planning and conducting studies; and (4) discusses the application of the Joint Committee Standards (1981) to the planning and conducting of policy studies in physical education. The term &quot;policy,&quot; using Thomas Green's definition,  commands a very broad interpretation and may encompass priorities, goals, preset decisions, rules for decision-making, practice guides, and predispositions to respond in certain ways to common situations. To ensure that policies are equitable and effective, evaluative studies are needed to assist in policy formulation as well as evaluation. Methodological issues such as utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy encompass a host of problems threatening the success of policy studies. The Joint Committee's 30 standards were developed to address these four issues. Of particular importance are the standards on audience identification, object identification, political viability, and formal or written obligation standards. (MLH)",

The intention is to identify a theory of knowledge about the types of educational policies likely to be most beneficial in helping China achieve its educational modernization objectives. Rogers' (1983) model, used as a framework for describing the phenomena under observation, posits four crucial elements in the diffusion of new ideas: (1) the innovation itself; (2) communication through certain channels; (3) time; and (4) the social system. The paper begins with a survey of educational development in China from before 1949 to the present. The recommendations are based on data collected, first,  through the involvement of faculty members of the University of Victoria in cooperative programs with the East China Normal University in Shanghai, and, second, through an open-ended data-gathering questionnaire sent to 30 Chinese scholars who had also studied in Canada. Reviewed by China experts at the East-West Center in Honolulu, the policy recommendations call for (1) continuation of existing exchange programs sponsored by international agencies; (2) an increase in the number of Chinese scholars studying abroad and higher levels of support for Chinese students by western universities; (3) enhancement of the teaching of English as a foreign language, especially for adults; (4) special attention to development of the legal and administrative infrastructure of education in China; and (5)  cooperative education programs to establish closer ties between education and industry. Appended are four papers detailing the procedures involved in executing and evaluating the collaborative programs described in the paper. (TE)",

        "description":"School food service should be considered a vital aspect of school operations, not an appendage to the educational program. This handbook revolves around the federal Child Nutrition and National School Lunch program serving about 24 million pupils daily in over 90 percent of the nation's 89,200 public schools. The booklet helps explain various rules and regulations governing these and other federal nutrition programs and their management at state and local levels. The first chapter discusses the different responsibility levels and highlights the special populations served (Head Start, handicapped, and allergic youngsters) and various management approaches. The second chapter, on financial management, considers revenue sources, pricing, recordkeeping, budgets, and other functions.  The third chapter, on personnel, covers job descriptions, responsibilities and qualifications, employment practices and procedures, and staffing and classification. The fourth chapter discusses production and service operations, while the fifth chapter covers food purchasing, storage, and inventory control. The final chapter, on sanitation and safety, looks at food and chemical poisoning and ways to prevent it. Also included are appendices on state administrative review, federal procurement standards, and invitations to bid. (MLH)",

        "description":"This synthesis of research findings translates investigations in instructional leadership into a working model for practitioners--principals, assistant principals, teachers, and others. Three kinds of research--theoretical, practical, and ethnographic--are used to develop a model based on six interrelated functions of instructional leadership, covered in six chapters. The first of these is setting academic goals, and this involves communicating a vision of success and developing a plan of action. Chapter 2 addresses the task of organizing the instructional program. Included is a discussion of managing the school as a loosely coupled system, a section on curriculum management, and an outline of organizational strategies. Chapter 3 discusses the hiring, supervision, and evaluation  of teachers. Chapter 4 provides strategies for protecting instructional time and programs, and chapter 5 discusses the importance of maintaining high expectations to establish a climate for learning. Chapter 6 is devoted to monitoring achievement levels and evaluating programs. Instead of the more common &quot;engineering&quot; model of evaluation (based on input/output analysis), a &quot;medical&quot; model is proposed, based on assessing a wider range of characteristics and looking at unintended as well as intended outcomes.

        "description":"This review surveys major currents of thought and practice in teacher evaluation. Citing recent state-mandated teacher evaluation policies and procedures, several compelling questions of accuracy, fairness, and utility are raised. In response to these questions, the document first focuses on the distinction between formative and summative evaluation, the relation of the latter to minimum standards and legal mandates, and the correlation of methods with purposes. Alternatives developed since the 1960s include goal-setting models such as the performance-objectives approach, outcome-based models, and clinical supervision models. In the next section, the separate problems of the two main participants in the teacher evaluation process--evaluators and teachers--are analyzed. The  evaluator's main concerns are the separation of summative and formative tasks, the need for expertise, and the relationship with the teacher, while teachers need to be involved in developing evaluation criteria, and they need to feel that the criteria by which they are evaluated are sound and relevant to their teaching. The fourth section discusses the three stages of teacher evaluation--preobservation conferences, the observation itself, and the postobservation conference--and touches on other sources of data besides observation: parent evaluations, peer observation, teaching materials, student evaluations, and self-evaluations. The conclusion addresses four key issues: (1) coexistence of teacher development and accountability; (2) supervision versus evaluation; (3) utility of evaluation  in improving teaching; and (4) the most productive, least time-wasting approaches to observation. Appended is a syllabus of Thomas McGreal's training program for staff and supervisors. (TE)",

        "description":"This review summarizes the rapidly growing body of findings on the social and organizational environment of teaching and examines one innovation--the collaborative school--that offers promise of an organizational context more conducive to effective teaching. Chapter 1 characterizes the actual conditions under which teachers work, focusing on interactions among teachers and between them and administrators. Chapter 2 examines the formal and informal bonds connecting the classroom, the individual school, the school district, and the state and federal governments. It is concluded that the individual school is the vital unit of school reform and that the workplace conditions of the school play a major role in school effectiveness. Accordingly, chapter 3 sets forth the characteristics  of collaborative schools--a set of attitudes and the interactions generated by those attitudes that researchers have found to correlate with improved teaching and learning. Chapter 4 describes formal programs that educators have developed to help administrators introduce norms of collaboration in schools where teachers are accustomed to working in isolation from one another, and practical suggestions are offered about ways in which principals' day-to-day activities can encourage such norms. These suggestions include forming teacher committees to work on specific school problems and providing teachers with time to observe one another. An 82-item, 8-page bibliography is included. (TE)",

One important program aspect is mentoring relationships between candidates and experienced local administrators. This paper describes the development and implementation of the mentoring component at Ohio State University (Columbus). After providing background and definitions, the paper describes informal, naturally developing mentoring formats found in private industry and in recent efforts to enhance women's leadership roles. More recently, the teacher education field has been contriving formal, mentoring arrangements. Six types  of mentors are discussed, including traditional mentors, supportive bosses, organizational sponsors, professional career mentors, patrons, and invisible godparents. Realistically, the supportive boss and professional career mentors are the most useful for structured administrator preparation programs. The roles and responsibilities of Danforth Program mentors; identification, selection, and recruitment procedures; and training methods and activities are discussed. In closing, certain problems concerning mentor selection, matching mentors and candidates, and program manageability are addressed. Despite some decided limitations, there is great value in the mentoring approach for preparing administrators. Included are 14 references. (MLH)",

The data cover tuitions of religiously affiliated and nonsectarian schools, as well as tuition charged at elementary and secondary grade levels. The patterns are based on data collected from a national probability sample of schools. The response rate to the survey was 84.6 percent. Nearly 6 million elementary and secondary school students were enrolled in over 25,000 private schools, which included regular schools and special purpose schools (i.e., schools for special education, alternative education, vocational education). Almost 94 percent required tuition payment. An overall measure of average tuition would oversimplify the complexity of private  school tuitions. A schedule of several averages according to key private school characteristics (religious orientation and grade level) better describes tuition levels and more accurately portrays a typical tuition. Looking only at data from regular private schools charging tuition, tuition levels vary systematically according to school orientation and grade level. The lowest tuitions are in Catholic schools, and the highest in nonsectarian schools. Elementary schools have lower tuitions than schools at other grade levels. Even within categories of religious orientation, tuition levels vary by grade level. Analyses of tables of data include implications, technical notes, data definitions, and precision of estimates. The report provides survey notations and a research office contact.  (CJH)",

This paper examines the efforts of an educational administration department at Valdosta State College, Valdosta, Georgia, to evaluate its program in terms of this relationship. The department's review began with a focus on how field-based experiences could be used to structure program sequence and content. The review expanded to an examination of educational purpose concerning constituent needs and educational reform pressures. Ongoing evaluation and restructuring of the field experiences have been based on student evaluations, as well as professional  judgment and state mandates. This report recommends that, in addition, use of the following program assessment techniques would reveal gaps in course offerings that should be addressed. First, the course competency analysis matrix should be developed. Second, adopting a more formal evaluation mechanism would enable supervisors to assess the utility of field experiences in developing administrative personnel and providing in-school support. This feedback could assist faculty in determining the perceived validity of requirements and how these perceptions affect field experiences, course content, and program sequence. Finally, extended followup studies of graduates could provide predictive validity for many competencies considered to be important. These beginning efforts to answer school  reform requirements may bridge the theory-practice gap. (CJH)",

With regularity, however, adolescents with IDDM are shown to be in less good metabolic control than younger children or young adults. The study explored the combined effects of cognitive maturity and stressful life events on metabolic control among 120 adolescents (mean age 15.2 years) with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Subjects were individually administered the Hunt Paragraph Completion Method measure of cognitive maturity and the Johnson and McCutcheon inventory of stressful life events. Metabolic control was assessed by total glycosylated hemoglobin. Analysis of  variance revealed significant effects on metabolic control related to sex (p &lt; .01), cognitive maturity (p &lt; .001), and negative life events (p &lt; .05). Adolescents with lower cognitive maturity were more likely to have elevated glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Likewise those with more and more intensely rated negative life events had higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Finally, females were in less good metabolic control than their male peers. Age, positive life events and early or late onset of IDDM were not significant. (CL)",

Regression models indicated that the majority of normal and LD second grade subjects used an implicit counting strategy for problem solution. However, LD subjects required a greater amount of time to execute this task and appeared to be deficient in the ability to self-monitor the problem solving process. A shift from reliance on the counting strategy to a memory retrieval process from the second to sixth grade was  evident for normal subjects, but not for LD subjects, the majority of whom relied on the counting strategy throughout the elementary school years.

In study 1, prompting was compared with presenting no information during the study interval. In experiment 2, prompting was compared with presenting such information at the end of the study interval (confirmation condition). Effects of length of the study and test interval were also analyzed. Results revealed that presenting information at the beginning of a study interval about the number of dots a symbol contains led to better performance than either presenting such information at the end or not presenting such information at all. Underestimations  were more prevalent than overestimations when dot numerosity was presented at any time during the study interval. Finally, item difficulty was directly related to the number of dots an item contained. (CL)",

        "description":"The paper describes the PROVE School, an alternative high school providing behavioral and academic programming using an extended school day concept for profoundly behavior disordered students in Proviso township, Maywood, Illinois. The extended day concept of crisis intervention (in which students are allowed to leave school for the day only when they demonstrate socially acceptable standards of conduct) is combined with a continuum of positive and negative consequences. Positive program components include a behavior modification point system, regular positive social reinforcement, and positive staff interaction on a one-to-one basis. Among negative approaches to programming are loss of points, time after regular school hours, and physical restraint when necessary. Program  terminology is explained and includes &quot;child finds&quot; (to combat truancy), &quot;late night and overnight coverage&quot; (when students are required to remain after school hours), &quot;activity coverage&quot; and &quot;good times&quot; (reinforcing activities tailored to individual student preferences). The literature on the extended school day concept is briefly reviewed and results are given of a survey of 25 area alternative schools for the following: length of detention programs, after school programs, faculty meetings and parent meetings, and faculty compensation methods and future plans. Finally, present operational practices of the extended day programming are detailed for each of the program components. (DB)",

Results of interviews with SSA and state officials as well as analysis of statistical data and sample reimbursement claims indicate that current SSA funding provides little incentive to work with disabled persons covered under the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program. Among problems identified are lack of motivation on the part of SSDI beneficiaries (because they are older and more severely disabled than other clients); difficulty in satisfying SSA criteria for reimbursement; and cumbersome procedures for claimant  reimbursement.

Chapter 53 of the New York State Education Laws (1980) requires screening of students in the areas of physical development, cognitive skills, receptive and expressive language, articulation, and gross and fine motor skills. The overall aim of the review here reported was to determine the need for a more comprehensive evaluation. The evaluation consisted of a survey of screening staff, technical analysis of the screening instruments used, and a review of the reliability and validity data for the primary level screening instrument, the Brigance K and 1 Screen. Findings indicate that 15% of New York City students are  involved each year in screening, of whom 57% are kindergarten or grade 1 students; and that 85% of the English speaking (but only 63% of the limited English proficient students) were fully screened by the end of the school year. Among recommendations the following are stressed: the need for centrally issued specifications on program objectives; the consideration of screening purposes in the establishment of cutoff scores; and the provision of equitable screening for limited English proficient students.

Twenty-three children, aged 7 to 16 years old, were identified through a referral process involving schools and parents. Only two subjects were female. A detailed analysis of school records; individual assessments of cognitive, affective, and language abilities; and parent interviews were utilized. An instructional component was designed to provide an appropriate and motivating educational program focusing on computer education; affective development; and a study of the brain, learning, and behavior. Among conclusions of the project were the following: that most schools identified students who were underachieving gifted children rather  than learning disabled students (who would be expected to exhibit verbal-performance scale discrepancies and large amounts of subtest scatter); that successful learning disabled gifted individuals overcome their deficits by compensating with strengths; and that learning disabled gifted children may \"alter the processing\" of information by developing strategies using preferred performance modes. Among eight recommendations were the following: evaluate strengths and weaknesses in information processing; assist the development of metacognitive strategies; teach students to compensate for weaknesses by using strengths; develop higher order problem solving and information processing skills.

The study examined aspects of transition from school to work in the first job after high school and group differences associated with these variables. Also examined was the incidence of dropping out by handicapped individuals. Results indicated there were significant differences in employment status and the occupational job clusters in which former students became employed, with those identifying themselves as learning disabled or hearing or speech impaired most often in full-time employment and least often in postsecondary educational programs. The health impaired were least likely to be employed.  Findings on dropout rates among the handicapped students varied considerably, with the rate of some groups (learning disabled and hearing impaired) far exceeding the rate of their nonhandicapped peers. Results supported previous findings that limited education and unemployment are likely outcomes for mildly handicapped students. Results have implications for transition models such as the three bridge model of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation and suggest a current inability of the service delivery structure to assist mildly handicapped students in their transition to postsecondary education or work.

Although the three groups did not differ in their recall of visually presented stimuli, DS subjects showed significantly poorer recall of auditorially presented stimuli than the other two groups (which did not differ). Furthermore, the poor auditory memory of DS subjects did not improve under testing conditions designed to minimize auditory and visual distractions. Results suggested that poor auditory short-term memory for  verbal information is tied more closely to DS than to low intelligence in general, and is not caused by a special susceptibility of DS individuals to attentional distractors.

        "description":"A study investigated the long-term impact of acceleration on academically talented youth. Twenty-three females and 20 males completed questionnaires about the California State University at Sacramento (CSUS) Academic Talent Search Program they had attended 4 years previously as junior high students. Students reported on the experiences, academic achievements, and affective changes they attributed to their Academic Talent Search participation. Responses were analyzed using frequency distribution and cross tabulation tables. Students viewed academic acceleration through the program as highly positive. Participation was associated with positive changes in attitude toward academic subjects, school, and self. Social relationships and emotional stability showed favorable rather than  unfavorable changes. The students were active in a wide variety of extracurricular activities, had positive self-concepts, viewed themselves as having control of their lives, and had formulated plans for the future, including career goals.

The group study of subjects with hemiplegia divided the children into four groups based on hemispheric side and age at injury. This approach sought to investigate quantitative differences between groups and normal controls. Another approach examined the existence of qualitative differences between subjects who had undergone hemispherectomies during various stages of childhood. Results indicated that postnatally acquired left hemisphere lesions led to significant deficits in spelling ability. The nature and extent of this deficit was demonstrated by comparing spelling performance of early and late left  hemispherectomy cases with equivalent right-sided cases. The magnitude of the impairment was much more pronounced the later in life the left hemisphere injury was sustained. (Author/CL)",

The focus of the study was on data collected from student records concerning students' first special education reevaluations and their subsequent educational placement. District, federal, and state policies were also examined. Among conclusions drawn were that students' English language proficiency was emphasized at initial and triannual evaluations, even though successfully distinguishing linguistic differences from speech or language disorders requires comparison of students'  dual language skills. Pragmatic skills were rarely considered. Federal, state, and local policy or administrative guidelines fail to address specific procedures for safeguarding language minority students in the identification, assessment, and placement process. Procedures used by districts when LEP students were considered for continued special education placement were essentially the same as those used for English-speaking students. Language status was given little attention by assessment personnel or placement committees. Detailed recommendations are offered in the areas of native language assessment, triannual assessments, appraisal personnel, placement committees, and recommended research. (JW)",

Such individuals are usually those who need to be trained under conditions more closely matching those of the workplace. Thus, work-related social skills should be taught, at least in part, in work settings. Factors to be considered in making the decision to focus training on work-at-school experiences, competitive employment, or a combination of both, are the student's age, motivation, readiness to perform jobs, previous work experience, evidence of lack of skill, availability of work opportunities, level of administrative support, and adequate release time for teachers to develop and use work experiences for vocational training.  Successful employment programs employ two strategies: reasonable accommodations by business (e.g., altering tasks), and training of social skills within normal work routines or in special training sessions. Systematic long-term follow-up should be a fundamental part of all employment training and placement programs, including on-side visits, interviews with the client, and follow-up with work supervisors and co-workers.

Findings showed that at each age, hard of hearing infants spent more time looking at their mothers' hands than did the normally hearing infants; the two groups of infants showed similar patterns of expression of affect; mothers of hard of hearing infants produced more gestures than did mothers of hearing infants at both 10- and 12-month sessions, and appeared more hurried and eager to  maintain their infants' visual attention than the other mothers; and each of the mothers of hard of hearing infants expressed concerns and worries about their child's speech and language development.

Subjects' performance was measured by the number of words accurately identified and the response latency. Results did not support the hypotheses. Children recognized more vocabulary in print than in fingerspelling; were more accurate in deciding the lexical status of words presented in print than words presented in fingerspelling; and were more accurate in deciding the lexical status of words that are typically signed in sign language than words that are typically fingerspelled. Results suggested that deaf children organize their recognition of written  words around sign language and do not organize their recognition of fingerspelled words around sign language. (CL)",

A second brochure focuses in greater depth on aspects of identification, including linguistic and cultural factors. The program's identification efforts are focused primarily, though not exclusively, on the limited English proficient school population. The 3-stage identification process consists of open recruitment, talent pool, and formal identification. Parallel identification  procedures for academic and artistic ability are used. Standardized tests and locally developed information forms are noted. A third brochure describes instructional approaches, including components of the program model (resource room, after-school program, and regular class component), staff development, student needs assessment, and curriculum components based on Renzulli's Enrichment Triad and bilingual education. Finally, sample curriculum units, the use of computers, and materials available for dissemination are cited. (JW)",

TIP's use of Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores as admission criteria is seen as more reliable and democratic than less objective procedures. Examples of ineffectual admission criteria and course offerings of dubious quality and content are cited to underscore TIP's preference for academically rigorous courses based on the liberal arts tradition and  emphasizing high-level, fast-paced instruction. Finally, the issue of elitism is addressed, including the need for educators to understand the difference between equal opportunity and equal potential, as well as the responsibility of a democratic society to nurture its gifted citizens.

        "description":"In designing a curriculum to assist children in learning English as a second language (ESL), a thorough understanding of the differences between the first and second languages is essential. With such an understanding, problems and concepts that may cause language interference and learning difficulties can be identified and an appropriate curriculum that will best meet the needs of bilingual children can be designed. The recent low achievement of the children of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is due in part to lack of English language skills for academic or personal communication. An ESL curriculum has been developed to enhance the children's English language competence while encouraging retention of the Choctaw language and Choctaw cultural traditions. A formal  evaluation was performed through the administration of the Language Assessment Scales (LAS) to 50 kindergarten through third-grade students twice a year over a three-year period. Through item analysis of the results, together with analysis of the children's speech and writing, phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic features in the two languages that were suspected of causing interference in English acquisition were identified and targeted in the curriculum, which is designed for three levels of English proficiency: non-English speakers, limited English speakers, and fluent English speakers. An intensive study of the Choctaw language and how it differs from English allowed the incorporation of instructional concepts aimed at enhancing the children's language skills affected  by the absence or difference of particular structures in each language, and the concepts were selected based on the functional and meaningful applications of English in the children's environment. Appendices contain item analyses of LAS scores, a graph showing LAS totals for all schools for fall, 1983, by levels of proficiency, and a fold-out chart showing the ESL curriculum design for Choctaw children grouped by proficiency levels for the first through the fourth nine-week term.

In general, results indicated that while high measurement accuracy was observed, misfit was present at the midpoints of the performance scales. Misfitting subjects were not disproportionately  representative of any one sex or language group background, but did show writing characteristics involving low content ratings relative to other subscale categories and having abnormally low cohesion, which may represent disordered language and thought patterns.

The testing instrument used was a 36-item English language test based on an English textbook used in the program. Results suggest that the cloze items, as contrasted with the elision items, are most representative of the total test score, which could be due to the relative familiarity of the item formats or to the formats themselves. Additional explanations for the results are examined. The complexity of the MDS procedure is necessary to reflect the intricacies of the cognitive processes that item-level  analysis can reveal. The major drawback, however, is the present inability of specialists in the field to interpret multidimensional findings more meaningfully. Further research is recommended. (MSE)",

In these tests, students are asked to correct errors inserted in written prose passages. When errors are not overtly marked, students often overlook them. This study examined patterns of oversight in two PC tests used to evaluate skills in English as a second language (ESL). In one test, students had to consult a picture to correct semantic inaccuracies and other errors. In the other, students had to correct a written passage without consulting a picture. Results of the picture test were compared with scores on a standardized English test, results of the second test were compared with holistic evaluations of class essays, and for both tests, the results obtained  from native and non-native English speakers were compared. Results of some of the analyses suggest that PC tests may be useful for research in second language learning and for second language instruction. However, some patterns in the test results suggest potential problems in interpretation. These include differences among native speakers' performances, discrepancies between PC and holistic evaluation results, and low inter-item correlations despite a high internal consistency measurement.

Students were asked to rate course quality and the quantity of various course materials and tasks. The results showed an overall positive reaction to the course, with the exception that students were disappointed with what they perceived to be a lack of teacher availability. It is concluded that (1) negative perceptions of teacher availability were primarily due to student attitudes about the use of teacher office hours, and (2) negative student attitudes at the outset of the course improved during the course, suggesting that it is possible to give a successful methods course in China.

The discussion begins with a description of foreign language instruction in the German school system and explains how reading for pleasure supports language learning within and beyond school. The reasons for introducing readers are compared with the common arguments against them, and approaches to the use of readers for mixed-ability groups are described. Appropriate commercially-produced materials are reviewed, and their common characteristics are noted. Classroom experiments in the use of readers are summarized.

        "description":"While it is clear that this is an era of global interdependence, the ideology of single language learning persists in the United States. We need to re-examine the view that learning a particular foreign language satisfies global communication needs. It is not sensible to have students spend hundreds of hours studying one foreign language and culture. Esperanto or another easily learned, transcendent language should be internationally adopted and stressed in schools around the world, for all students to learn. Important professional associations in education should begin to study this need, individually and collectively. Leaders and policymakers should support general instruction in a viable, transcendent language through the allocation of federal resources. Theorists must  consider the implicit discrimination in the use of only a few selected national languages, and foreign language teachers at all levels should re-examine their attitudes about a planned, artificial, neutral, transcendent language. Finally, schools need to expose prospective teachers and administrators to artificial language, make clear the value of such languages, and encourage them to acquire competency in a transcendent language.

These analyses are refuted, and a more concrete and realistic treatment is proposed for each. Examination of Anglo-Frisian Brightening, or First Fronting, raises several questions about the analysis by Lass and Anderson, which are avoided in a theory proposing that the phenomenon was non-existent already in the synchronic grammar of Old English, and therefore was not maintained as a synchronic phonological rule until Middle English times. The analysis of Mercian Second Fronting refutes Dresher's account and posits Second Fronting as a genuine sound change that ran its course in Old English times.  It is seen as a variable rule that was applied to surface forms but was inhibited in backing environments. This solution involves non-abstract forms and no rule ordering. (MSE)",

        "description":"Formal definitions are one example of &quot;decontextualized&quot; language use, in which reliance on background knowledge shared with the interlocutor is minimized, and use of conversational devices is avoided. Definitions of English nouns by 137 second- to fifth-grade children, about half of whom were non-native English speakers, were analyzed to assess the children's tendency to use the formal definitional genre, their sophistication in using it, and their tendency to rely on conversational devices during the testing session. Seventy of the children were also tested in French, a second language for most of them. Both the tendency to use formal definitions and the sophistication of the definitions offered were found to increase from second to fifth grade, to be affected by proficiency in  the language being tested, and to be related to school achievement as reflected in standardized test scores. Use of conversational devices during the testing session was negatively related to achievement and to language proficiency. The developments in sophistication of formal definitions observed and the relationships to school achievement found suggest that performing well on the task of giving formal definitions requires skill in the use of decontextualized language, that such skill is independent of lexical or syntactic knowledge, and that the decontextualized skills may be crucial to success in classroom discourse and in literacy.

They include peer practice, the jigsaw approach, cooperative projects, group investigation, and learning together.  Several curriculum packages are available. Choice of method may depend on the teacher's subject matter and communication goals.

Thirty students in composition courses (10 native speakers and 20 non-native speakers, 10 each from a remedial and a standard class) wrote papers on the same topic using the same background reading text. Information from the source text used in the student papers was categorized as to type (explanations, summaries, paraphrases, quotations, and copied information), function (background, foreground), and section of paper (first paragraph, final paragraph, intervening body paragraphs). Results indicated that students made significantly more use of information in the final  paragraphs than in the body paragraphs. In their opening paragraphs, non-native speakers also used significantly more information from the source text than native speakers. In some cases, the student excerpt matched the background text except for slight changes in syntax or lexicon, but insufficient to constitute paraphrase, and more of these &quot;near copies&quot; and explanations of the background text functioned as foreground rather than background. The native speakers received higher mean holistic scores of writing quality than the non-native speakers due to more consistent academic style and tone in their written language. (Author/MSE)",

Principles that institutions can follow  in their response to accountability demands include: respond visibly to domains of legitimate external concern, build on strength, and show action.

As introduction, some significant points of the University's history that portray its commitment to academic freedom are cited, along with trends affecting academic freedom in the United States as a whole. It is suggested that academic freedom protects the right to explore controversial issues honestly, in the classroom and the laboratory. Two decades ago concern was mainly with loyalty oaths and speaker bans, measures adopted by the state legislatures in the 1950s to allay public apprehension about subversive activities on U.S. campuses. After the Kent State students were killed, one threat to academic freedom was legislation calling for dismissal of state university  professors who were convicted of offenses on or off campus. Threats to academic freedom today are of a different type: (1) those involving restrictions imposed by the federal government; (2) those of private groups who from one side of the political spectrum challenge the right to teach freely in the classroom; and (3) those who on the other side challenge the right to speak freely on university campuses.

        "description":"A 10-year study of salary differential by sex was undertaken at the University of North Dakota using a multiple regression methodology, with rank, discipline, degree, years in department, years in current rank, and sex as predictors. The sex variable evidenced lower salaries for women when controlling for the other variables throughout the study period for both proposed and actual salaries (from $341 in 1978-1979, proposed salary, to $1675 for 1981-1982, actual salary, to $504 for 1986-1987). This apparent drop in discrimination by sex in salary at each rank was accompanied by increasing differences in pay. The change is in the direction of market adjustments (i.e., paying lower salaries to those in disciplines with higher proportions of women). The actual amount of inequity by  sex often exceeded the projected inequity by sex; also, the inequity by sex appeared to peak in the early 1980s (in terms of the regression coefficient for sex) and has appeared to drop to only about $140 higher than projected for 1977-1978. Variables included in the regression analysis are identified. Data are provided on mean salaries by sex and rank for projected and actual salaries, 1977-1987. (Author/SW)",

Consideration is given to what instruction entails and the mental activities that occur when one is instructing. Difficulties in studying instruction are also addressed, and examples of research on instruction are based on studio instruction. The many and often conflicting conceptualizations of studio instruction are reviewed, from roots in the atelier to the work of today's cognitive theorists. The most recent research on teaching points to the urgency of studying both instructors' and students' thinking, processes of immense complexity. Studying complex thinking processes presents vexing methodological problems that have not yet been overcome. To illustrate  both the possibilities for research and the insufficiency of today's research methods, the examples cover Dinham's current research findings on instructors' conceptions of their roles, instructional planning, simultaneous streams of thought, communication difficulties, and students' thinking.

Characteristics of the independent learner that are essential in providing transformational leadership are also addressed. Nova University's innovative approaches provide nontraditional choices for a broad range of students. The Center for Higher Education provides a field-based Doctor of Education program for practitioners working in three specialized areas: higher education; leadership in adult education; and vocational, technical, and occupational education. The Center uses a field-based delivery format in combining instruction, independent study, and applied research. Students are required to complete seven seminars, five  practicums, and a major applied research project. Five of the seven seminars are core seminars that are required for all students regardless of specialization. The core seminars are: curriculum and program planning, governance and management, applied educational research and evaluation, learning theory and applications, and societal factors affecting education. Specialization seminars are also offered, and two are required of each student choosing that specialization. (SW)",

Tuition policies in SREB states are discussed, along with the following issues: tuition as a cost to the student, the cost of providing educational services, and tuition as a source of higher education revenue. In most SREB states, in-state students at public four-year institutions will pay 5-10% higher tuition and fees for 1987-1988. Tuition and fee increases will be as much as 24% at some institutions, but in all states the average increase is expected to be less than $200. From 1985-1986 to 1986-1987, tuition and fees increased an average of 14.5% for resident undergraduates at these public universities, all of which also offer master's and  doctoral degrees. For nonresident students, tuition and fees were three times greater, but increased less (11.5%). Data are included on: undergraduate tuition and fees at public institutions for each SREB state by type of doctoral institution, other four-year institutions, and two-year colleges for 1986-1987; and tuition and fees at public institutions for each SREB state for professional programs (law, medicine, dentistry, optometry, and veterinary medicine).

A survey of admission and selection processes for higher education and other factors associated with the transfer process was conducted, as was a survey of employers and employees. Areas for further development of credit transfer provisions were found, including the demand and need for opportunities, as well as changes to existing policies and practices in education and those associated with employment. Recommendations include providing: a public definition of the standing of middle level  TAFE qualifications in higher education, databases on the level and character of student movement from TAFE to higher education, standards of performance required in middle level TAFE courses to satisfy institution and course admission requirements, and admission procedures that assess the merit of applicants by relating the performance to objectives and standards of the course for which they apply.

Current concerns regarding minority representation in college and minority student achievement are outlined, and implications in the context of future trends are examined. Attention is directed to demographic and economic trends. While in the late 1960s and early 1970s, minority groups made great strides and fairly uniform strides in educational attainment, today that progress has become uneven. In general, minorities have higher attrition rates, lower grade point averages, and slower progression rates than majority students. Data are provided on college enrollments by  race/ethnicity of students for fall 1968 to fall 1986. Causes for disparities in achievement are considered that revolve around socioeconomic and psychological/cultural factors, as well as educational considerations. Ten task force recommendations for SHEEOs are offered, including: state and federal governments should help remove economic barriers to college attendance; and SHEEOs should establish a formal institutional planning and reporting process dedicated to improving minority student access and achievement.

Purposes of delineating institutional missions are identified, along with components of role and mission statements. General statements of purpose and profiles of current programs and activities are provided in the mission statements, as well as a projection of selected activities and characteristics into the future. State comparisons concerning mission development are provided for Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, Texas, and Utah. For each state, attention is directed to process and responsibility for mission development, uses/purposes of mission statements, and board/agency and institutional satisfaction with both the statements  and the planning process. This information was obtained in early 1987 from State Higher Education Executives Officers staff members. It is concluded that in those states where involvement of board members and central staff, college leaders, and other parties has been in proper balance, the planning process itself has seemed valuable. When mission review and development are conducted primarily at the central board level, the results are likely to be less satisfactory and difficult to adhere to. (SW)",

Telephone interviews were conducted with many state-level postsecondary agencies known to be active in mission-related studies. Broad-based involvement at substantive levels was found, and no agency undertook mission development or maintenance on its own. Four groups of participants were identified: institutional representatives, other campus-based individuals, government officials, and the general  population. Although practices varied across states, involvement in mission development and maintenance activities tended to follow common patterns. Stages of involvement in mission review activities are outlined, and examples of involvement patterns are provided. Also considered are: tools for maintaining missions, incentives for implementing missions, and the role of the state agency in strategic planning and mission development. (SW)",

It is suggested that like organizations, systems need to address three kinds of effectiveness: goal achievement, resource acquisition, and constituent satisfaction. Both organizations and systems can use three kinds of strategy to become more effective: linear, adaptive, and interpretive. Guidelines to assessing system effectiveness proposed by Stephen Bailey are provided. A linear strategy is shown to be similar to Bailey's question about relations with the governor and legislature. Interpretive strategy, the most important system task, addresses Bailey's questions about institutional relations and board philosophy. Adaptive  strategy recognizes volatile environments and the need for organizations to adapt. A cybernetic approach to effectiveness and strategy is considered that suggests that the methods for correcting unacceptable changes arise through trial and error. The concepts of strategic leadership and strategic policymaking are identified as fundamental to a system's success. (SW)",

Appended are: a section from a report entitled \"Time for Results: The Governors' 1991 Report on Education\" that covers assessment; and an article on an Education Commission of the States survey on current practices in assessment in public higher education entitled \"Assessment and Outcomes Measurement: A View from the States\" by Carol M.

In its report, \"Time for Results,\" the National Governors' Association Task Force on College Quality asked states to clearly define the role and mission of each public institution. The Role and Mission Task Force of the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) Association endorses the NGA recommendations. A better division of labor across institutions will foster not only quality but efficiency and public accountability. State boards, which articulate a vision for the system as a whole, also need clearly defined roles and missions. One of the most important goals of state  boards is to understand and interpret the needs of the state. State boards also play a vital role in breaking down the organizational barriers that impede student access and achievement. It is suggested that an effective board: has a sense of its own identity, purposes, and priorities; knows what the state needs and wants for higher education; acts to acquire or reallocate resources to meet state needs; communicates effectively with key constituencies; and draws conflicting interests together.

Attention is directed to: the potential pool of qualified high school graduates who could enter postsecondary education; the participation and enrollment rates of minorities; factors related to retention and success in undergraduate programs; and the representation of minorities in advanced-degree programs and the professions. The potential supply of minority students is revealed by population trends, high school graduation rates, and the performance of minorities in elementary and secondary education. Initial college participation rates and recent enrollment trends among minorities are examined for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, American Indians, and Whites. Data on  factors that affect college enrollment are also analyzed, including ethnicity, family income, parents' education, and high school grade average. Of concern are institutional responses to the minority retention problem; academic climate; and values, aspirations, and the student culture. Information is provided on the current status of Blacks and Hispanics in various occupations and the percentage of minority graduates in specific science and engineering fields. (SW)",

        "description":"Perspectives on the undergraduate curriculum are offered at a faculty convocation by the President Emeritus of Ohio State University. Criticisms of the content and quality of college studies are noted. It is suggested that for the most part today's curriculum reflects the legacy of the 1960s and 1970s by emphasizing the individual's right to choose as well as variety and diversity. It avoids serious discussion of social issues and controversy, and the faculty has largely abdicated its responsibility for the design of the curriculum. Important educational goals are for graduates to understand the role of art and literature in illuminating the human condition, to have empathy for the poor, and to develop civic pride and responsibility. Currently colleges are reassessing and  modifying their curricula and the government is asking higher education to define quality and measure college and student performance. The political pressure for student assessment results from discontent with today's college graduates. However, improved quality is attained in the private world of professors. While there is not all-purpose model curriculum, it is enough to toughen requirements, trim electives in the general education listing, and put together options that have rigor. (SW)",

Attention is also directed to how enrollment managers can utilize a systematic approach to optimize levels of fit between student and campus with a goal to recruiting and retaining students who will eventually become satisfied graduates. In describing student-institution fit, three important sets of factors need to be examined: (1) student characteristics; (2) institutional characteristics; and (3) the effects of interaction between student and institution (e.g., physical, cognitive, and affective interactions). An ecological framework for understanding fit is discussed that is related to the  person-environment interaction theoretical framework. The interactionist perspective would suggest that the student and the campus shape each other. A model for optimizing student-institution fit includes five action steps: (1) assessing entering student characteristics; (2) assessing the characteristics of the campus environment; (3) identifying levels of fit; (4) evaluating levels of fit; and (5) designing environmental interventions.

Results of a study at the Ursinus College (Pennsylvania) campus to assess both knowledge of and attitudes toward AIDS are summarized. Seventy-three percent of the 141 Introductory Psychology students sampled, reported moderate to extreme interest in learning more about AIDS. Although 98% of the sample reported learning much of what they knew about AIDS through the media, a fifth reported that the college staff had increased their understanding of this illness. Faculty can augment the Office of Student Life's educational programs by staying informed of new findings, allowing advisees to express their concerns about AIDs, and  referring students to additional information sources. In addition, the classroom provides another forum to educate students about human sexuality; the AIDS problem can be used to illustrate various concepts in different courses. For example, a biology lecture could deal with viruses and a political science discussion could address minority rights or mandatory testing. (SW)",

Data sources were: admissions records; results of the Freshman Testing Counseling and Advising Program, Testing and Counseling/Advising Phases; and transcripts and registration information. Four predictive models were developed that employed intellective and nonintellective variables that defined students' abilities, motives, and interests. Two of the models predicted academic achievement: the first predicted a student's cumulative  grade point average (GPA); the second predicted engineering GPA, which isolated specific engineering foundation courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The other two models predicted the probability of students' persisting successfully in engineering versus other enrollment status outcomes. The usefulness of the models for academic advising is addressed. The survey questionnaire and a freshman engineer data collection form are appended. (SW)",

The application of learning style theory most evident in the nursing literature appears to encompass four major dimensions: (1) learner preference, (2) learner response style, (3) information processing, and (4) cognitive style. Utilizing these theoretical notions in educational settings has been shown to lead to greater achievement of educational goals. It has also been demonstrated to have a significant impact on the attainment of professional outcomes in practice settings including the field of nursing. However, many nurse educators note major  contradictions in the learning style research disseminated in professional journals and question its validity for nursing practice. This confusion appears to have resulted from the failure of nurse educators and nurse researchers to recognize the multidimensional nature of learning style research and the conceptual framework from which each dimension evolves. It is proposed that research is needed to examine the degree of redundancy between conceptual dimensions defined within various learning style models. (SW)",

Of the 6,649 Alaska seniors, 2,971 (44.7%) responded to the survey. Comparisons were made between students planning for postsecondary education and those not planning for it. Questions were included to obtain information on disciplines targeted for statewide examination by the State Department of Education (science, natural resources, and social sciences). Among the findings are: (1) a  doubling of the percentage (22.7%) of seniors rating their overall high school experience as &quot;poor&quot;, compared to previous years; (2) differences in satisfaction among students in large schools compared to small schools; and (3) generally high overall satisfaction with decision-making abilities and experience in the target areas. Appended are the survey instrument and selected data tables. (LB)",

The report is the product of a committee of state policymakers, business leaders, and educators. It reviews demographic facts and economic consequences of population changes, particularly in the area of education. Twenty recommendations are related to the following goals: (1) education for a multicultural society (e.g., recognize student diversity and reflect it in educational policies and practices; expect all students to succeed); (2) keep minority  students in school (e.g., provide a core curriculum at the elementary and secondary levels that challenges and prepares all students); (3) double the proportion of minority college graduates (e.g., improvement recruitment and selection procedures); (4) bring more minorities into teaching, educational leadership, and the professions (e.g., create environments that support minority students and fosters strong faculty-student relationships); and (5) use financial resources to promote equity in education (e.g., halt the erosion of student aid and examine loan programs in terms of effects on students' educational decisions).

Section II reviews various approaches to outcome assessment as well as existing typologies for classifying outcomes, including works of Pace, Astin, Bowen, Ewell, and Lenning. A typology tentatively adopted by NCRIPTAL researchers is introduced and delimits the discussions of outcomes in Section III, which presents several common outcome measures. They are grouped in three  categories: (1) academic-cognitive outcomes (Graduate Record Examination, Undergraduate Assessment Program of the College Entrance Examination Board, American College Testing (ACT) Program achievement tests, ACT College Outcome Measures Project, College Level Examination Program, critical thinking and higher level outcome measures, basic skills); (2) academic-motivational outcomes; and (3) academic-behavioral outcomes (career/life goal exploration, diversity, persistence, faculty-student relationships).

Summary observations are offered that suggest complex interrelationships among mode of learning, method of teaching, learner attributes, teacher attributes, and organizational context. Recommendations are presented: (1) greater support should be provided for basic research, broader field testing, and improved translation for institutional researcher use; (2)  institutional research offices should broaden their mission to include the translation and field testing functions; (3) policy researchers need to weigh more heavily basic studies and related field tests; and (4) both institutions and governmental agencies need to sponsor carefully structured evaluation research.

        "description":"Prompted by a California State University trustee resolution in 1985 to offer an independent doctoral degree in education, this report aims to determine whether additional doctoral programs in educational administration are needed in California. It examines the history and professional uses of doctorates in education, and surveys perceptions of the degree (both Ed.D. and Ph.D.) and its importance in school and community college administration. Alternative forms of training and continuing education available to administrators are examined, and national trends are cited regarding number of degrees awarded, sex and ethnicity of degree recipients, career patterns, and length of time between bachelor's and doctoral degrees. Other issues relating to supply and demand in California are  discussed, including the adequacy of the current supply of doctorates. Based on 13 findings and 8 conclusions drawn from the evidence, the Commission offers two recommendations: (1) no new doctoral programs in educational administration should be established in any institution not now offering the degree, and (2) an intersegmental committee should investigate the needs and propose possible structures, components, and modes of delivery for doctoral programs designed specifically for present and future administrators in California's community colleges. An appendix describes the methods used by the Commission to survey graduate school deans, doctoral students, and school and community college administrators. (LB)",

The review is divided into the following sections: (1) performance measures in higher education: effectiveness, efficiency, quality, and student outcomes; (2) organizational culture and climate: an external perspective; (3) defining culture and climate in higher  education: conceptual confusion; (4) institutional strategy and student outcomes; (5) academic management practices: impacts on culture, climate, and student outcomes; (6) organizational characteristics: relationships to culture, climate and outcomes; (7) overview of organizational variables, practices, and characteristics; and (8) a conceptual synthesis: complexity or chaos. Both higher education and non-higher education literature is included. Five hundred and sixty-five references are included. (LB)",

Five perspectives are offered: Bowen's outcomes and goals; Feldman and Newcomb's student personality, values, and beliefs; Pace's achievement testing; Astin's longitudinal studies; and Pascarella's cognitive development in social contexts. Theoretical and methodological issues are discussed that set the stage for introducing new ways of explaining the impact of college, and theoretical models are introduced that are influenced by the heuristic orientation of cognitive psychology (Cantor and Kihlstrom's social-cognitive personology theory, and Baron's personality and intelligence theory). It is concluded that the impact  of college on students is mediated, influenced, or determined by interactions between diverse psychological processes. Depending on the theoretical orientation of the research, they have been labeled student involvement, openness to change, and quality of student effort. (LB)",

The first paper is by Clements and Merriman, who make a case for the reflection of Steinberg's information processing componential model of cognitive processes in the LOGO language and computational environment; present a series of experiments that attempted to tailor the environment to aspects of the theoretical model and to assess transfer of componential and metacomponential skills; and speculate on how to structure an ideal LOGO environment to facilitate transfer of cognitive skills. In the second paper, Perkins, Schwartz, and Simmons report their findings from interviews with naive BASIC programmers, including their need for a mental model of the computing process, lack of good problem solving  strategies, and problems in personal confidence and control. A metacourse designed to teach metacognitive skills is proposed to address these problems. Fay and Mayer, in the third paper, argue that LOGO mastery is affected by the cognitive misconceptions of naive learners, and provide a computational model of such misconceptions. In the final paper, Webb and Lewis confirm that group learning of programming has positive results and propose a metacourse to promote efficacious group behavior. (MES)",

The science-related instructional treatments were completed by 98 students who were blocked by gender and reading ability and randomly assigned to experimental treatments. It was found that students under learner control scored significantly higher on the posttest than those under program control, and males had significantly higher posttest scores than females and more favorable attitudes toward the instruction and toward computer use. A significant treatment X gender X reading ability interaction indicated that the differences in favor of learner control were due primarily to the  significantly higher performance by high ability females and low ability males under learner control than under program control. Time to completion was the same for both groups of subjects. Overall results indicate that students under limited learner control adjust their study behavior to achieve greater learning in the same amount of time.

Subjects were 89 kindergarten students whose primary language was English, and whose performance on the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts was within the average range chosen from classes in a predominantly low income New York City school district. Nine relational concepts were selected for CAI over a six-week period, and three conditions of computer-generated feeeback--textual, symbolic, and pictorial--were presented to the experimental groups. A control group participated in a color matching game on the computer. Motivational effects were measured by time and trials-to-criterion on the computer, and the Boehm Test of Basic  Concepts was used to measure the immediate and delayed effects of CAI on the children's level of knowledge of basic relational concepts. Results indicated that, although children's performance across experimental groups was significantly better than the performance of the control group, there were no significant differences in performance among the feedback groups. These results suggest that learning within a microcomputer environment may be intrinsically stimulating for very young children. Three tables and 28 references are included. (Author/MES)",

Observations were made on a total of 25 children in one grade 3 and one grade 4 classroom who were participating in an ongoing project on the development of writing skills. Students were individually instructed on the Apple MacWrite text editor in four 20-30 minute sessions approximately one week apart and wrote on topics assigned by teachers as part of their regular classroom work. Experimenters took detailed notes on what the child typed, what changes were made to the text,  what commands were used, and any comments or questions. In addition, the first and fourth sessions were videotaped. It was found that: (1) all of the fourth graders and 80% of the third graders had learned the basic keyboard commands by the end of the first session; (2) children found the mouse more difficult to learn than the keyboard commands; (3) the number of works produced increased across sessions for both grades; and (4) children made very few revisions affecting the meaning of their work--most changes were to correct typing errors, and revision rates decreased across sessions. It is suggested that children may begin to make more substantive revisions when they have more experience with the text editor as a writing tool. (MES)",

        "description":"This statewide survey (parelleling a 1983 study) was conducted by the Oregon Department of Education in 1985 to assess the status of microcomputer usage and instructional microcomputing in the public schools of the state. A total of 1,181 principals responded to the mailed questionnaire for a response rate of 96% as opposed to 90% in 1983. The information sought was similar to the 1983 survey in requesting data on: the number and types of computers used for instruction; how the microcomputers were being used for each of the most prevailing instructional functions; the number of computer literate teachers; and whether the individual school districts had computer literacy goals. Additional questions addressed: the location of computers in the schools; whether the school had  designated a computer coordinator; the types of students receiving instruction in computer literacy; and the percentage of teachers using computers for instruction. Comparisons of the results of the two surveys show: (1) an increase of 132% in the number of computers used for instruction; (2) a significant increase in the number of computers per school; and (3) a shift in the provision of computer literacy instruction from all students in 1983 to, in 1985, those students in grades 7-12 who were taking mathematics or science courses. A comparison of these survey results with the results of the latest national survey of instructional uses of school computers (edited by Henry Becker) concludes the brief narrative report. Tables displaying the data for the current survey are presented in two  appendices which make up the major part of this report. (RP)",

        "description":"Education courses in BASIC remain a foundation of teacher training for computer use. Such courses do little more than re-invent programming structures that are already available in such educational programming languages (EPLs) as PILOT and TEACH. While BASIC is the only general programming language that is both simple and powerful enough to enable beginning programmers like teachers to develop software in their own content area, it typically limits them to writing simple programs with multiple-choice format answers. An EPL can generate more powerful, more flexible software in less time without requiring knowledge of a more difficult lower-level programming language. Education courses emphasizing BASIC are obsolete, and educational computing classes should be restructured toward  the more versatile EPLs. Teachers, particularly in the humanities, would be better served by mastering one of these languages. BASIC remains useful to know since so many programs have been written in the language, but it should be offered at a reading-knowledge-only level in computer literacy courses. (Author/RP)",

Currently no plan exists that: (1) characterizes which agency requirements should be met by centrally provided services and which should be met by the agencies themselves; (2) identifies needed government-wide technical standards; or (3) defines the responsibilities of the central managers and the individual agencies. It was also determined  that some major decisions shaping GSA's planned procurements for local and long-distance services, which total over $5.5 billion, have been made without adequate analysis.

A three-level definition of the ERIC system is provided; the goal of making ERIC a comprehensive dissemination program is refined to one of making it a comprehensive information service; and the relationship of ERIC to other parts of a comprehensive dissemination system is described. Additional considerations that are discussed include the dilemma of choosing between indirect and direct strategies of service provision, the question of generalization versus specialization, and the value of cooperative relationships with other programs, particularly regional laboratories and  research centers. Finally, the role of information in educational improvement is presented from the three perspectives of technology transfer, renewal, and facilitation. It is concluded that it is essential that ERIC become more firmly grounded in a theory of knowledge use, and that studies of ERIC be used in making design decisions.

Although cylinders were the first sound recordings to be sold commercially, discs were introduced in 1894 and ultimately became more popular. The library collection of sound recordings began with the founding of the Sadie Knowland Coe Music Collection at the Evanston Public Library in 1907 during the acoustic, or pre-electric era (1877-1925) when recordings were still made and reproduced by mechanical means. Following the introduction of electrical recordings, more libraries inaugurated record collections, albeit  with some caution, and by the 1940s, the idea that collections of records belonged in libraries had won acceptance. The convenience of the long-playing (LP) record, introduced in 1948, appealed to the public and librarians alike; and stereo, introduced publicly 10 years later, provided the final great improvement for pre-1980s audio recordings. Most recently, direct-to-disc, digital, and compact disc (CD) recordings have resulted in clearer sound reproduction, as well as increased problems of selection, storage, and access for librarians.

Following introductions by James P. Riley and William J. Welsh, Senator Albert Gore, Jr., presented the keynote address. The first panel session, Information Policies and Public Needs, with Joseph H. Howard presiding, included discussions of Government Printing Office (GPO) issues (Donald E. Fossedal); information policy questions (Donna Demac); depository library concerns (Glyn T. Evans); and a  journalist's view (Lee Edwards). Topics presented at the second panel session, Information Policies and National Interests, with Jane Bortnick presiding, included security policies (John C. Wobensmith); communications issues (Elizabeth L. Young), impacts on the science community (J. Thomas Ratchford), and a secondary publisher's view (Herbert B. Landau). Highlights of each of these papers are included in the narrative. (KM)",

Weeks Library at the University of South Dakota (USD); the study which examined both the actual time elapsed in filling interlibrary loan requests and the causes for delays. An introduction to the problem is provided; the library staffing and interlibrary loan process are described; and related literature is reviewed. In addition, a brief discussion of the study methodology describes the tracking of a total of 253 interlibrary loan request forms submitted to the Interlibrary Loan office during April 1986. Study results indicate that 28% of the requests were completed in one week (7 days), 61% were completed in two weeks (14 days), and 76% were completed in four weeks (28 days).  Factors beyond the control of the library staff caused a delay in the completion of 19 of the 39 requests not completed after 28 days. It is recommended that borrowing materials for local USD patrons be made a clear priority for interlibrary loan, that regular follow-up procedures be instituted, and that an additional half-time staff position be added. Study results are presented in ten tables and interlibrary loan request and time study forms are included. A 20-item bibliography is also provided. (KM)",

        "title":"Assessing the Student Attrition Problem. ERIC Digest.",
        "description":"As the entering-college population dwindles and competition to attract this population increases among colleges, student retention has become a primary concern for community colleges. Assessing the extent of the dropout problem is particularly problematic for community colleges, as they are institutions geared to the facilitation of ease of entrance, exit, and reentry. In an attempt to clarify the community college attrition phenomenon, one 1982 study identified three categories of attrition: &quot;positive attrition,&quot; which refers to students who have met their objectives or transferred; &quot;neutral attrition,&quot; which refers to students who leave due to a job or other scheduling conflict; and &quot;negative attrition,&quot; which refers to students unprepared or unmotivated for their studies.  Because of the complex nature of drop-in and dropout patterns, each college needs to determine the extent of its own attrition problem. Retention studies can take a variety of approaches. For example, Spoon River College (Illinois) conducted a study focusing on the differing needs of full- and part-time students, and demonstrated the effectiveness of specifically designed retention plans for these different student populations. Valencia Community College (Florida) conducted a study concentrating on the factors affecting the retention of a single minority group, black students. Middlesex County College (New Jersey) drew from the insights of a number of special populations within the student body to assess the interaction between institutional provisions and student needs, while the City  Colleges of Chicago examined institutional variables and their effects on student course completion.

The GAA was completed by a sample of 8,024 students at four large, urban community college districts. The scores on the math portion of the test were cross tabulated by selected student characteristics (e.g., age, ethnicity, native language, and reason for attending college) and educational background variables (e.g., number of college units already completed, and number of math courses taken). Results of the analysis revealed that the highest mean GAA scores in mathematics were achieved by: (1) younger students recently graduated from high  school; (2) students intending to transfer to a four-year college; and (3) students who rated their abilities in algebra as &quot;excellent.&quot; GAA math scores also correlated positively with the number of semester hours completed and the number of mathematics courses completed.

Expected outcomes of the process were to define future directions for BCCC, capitalize upon present and future realities, provide systematic processes whereby the college is able to maintain or change its posture in fulfilling its mission, and achieve other objectives related to institutional image, resource allocation, program coordination, and college administration. The major aspects of the BCCC planning process included the following: discussion of mission and goals, internal assessment, external assessment, values clarification, development of planning assumptions, identification of strategic issues,  campus-wide hearings, setting of priorities, and development of unit plans, dean plans, and the college plan. Within BCCC's planning structure is a Planning Council consisting of the five college deans and at least one representative apiece from faculty, staff, community, and the student body. The Council uses internal and external assessment data provided by the Dean of Institutional Research to develop planning assumptions, identify strategic issues, commission position papers, and set institutional priorities. This structure also calls for a close linking of budgeting and planning. Based on a spring 1987 evaluative meeting of the planning council, recommendations for improving the planning process were made, stressing the increased involvement of trustees, the president, and deans.

The series of 10 16-hour workshops held during summer 1987 were intended primarily as in-service training for secondary school foreign language teachers and secondarily as a retraining for secondary school teachers specializing in areas other than language who had been assigned to teach languages the next academic year. The workshops were designed to help teachers: (1) become familiar with current terminology and methods of measuring oral proficiency; (2) increase their own oral proficiency in the language they teach; (3) increase their security and confidence in speaking that language; (4) develop an enhanced  repertoire of instructional activities and materials; (5) gain cultural information about the people who speak that language; and (6) use the computer to generate instructional materials. Recruitment activities, which were conducted at local, state, and national levels, resulted in the filling of all 190 funded participant positions. The project report describes the content and outcomes of the workshops, providing pre- and post-test data on the achievement of objectives, as well as plans for 1988.

The reports and working notes of the small groups assigned to examine these topics were used to create this summary document. Following introductory information on the conference, the issue of access is discussed in terms of four \"action areas\" (i.e., providing information about procedures and standards to high school and other potential students, as well as to current ones; providing services at the \"front-end\" which are designed to ease enrollment of any student at the time and place of first inquiry and of subsequent enrollments; providing the instructional support  to students that enables academic success within the open doors of the community college; and providing services and instruction addressing the broadest possible range of student needs). Next, a discussion on assessment stresses the importance of active board support, personal interaction with students, and sensitivity to student anxieties in the assessment process. This section then considers issues related to when to assess, what to assess, and mandatory assessment. The discussion on intervention addresses the important components of coordinated college-wide commitment, orientation processes, and a system for monitoring academic progress, as well as optional intervention strategies.

        "description":"Reported are studies attempting to describe the sorts of skills that toddlers need if they are to successfully complete intentional, or volitional, actions. A variety of tasks designed for children 15 to 35 months of age were administered; additional data were gathered that were relevant to the child's awareness of producing an outcome and emotional reactions to producing outcomes. Tasks were engaging; were within the manual capacity and understanding of the youngest child in the sample; and required some monitoring and control for successful completion. Specific task outcomes were explained or modeled. Each task involved conditions requiring control, such as waiting, selecting materials, or avoiding distractions. In this paper, specific tasks and results are described. General  questions concerning relationships between understanding what to do, volitional skills, the self, and action are discussed. Findings suggest that much of the impetus for increasing volitional skills comes from the child's own interest in and attention to the mastering of action problems. Equally as important as external sources of control were challenges inherent in everyday, volitional actions. In general, children acquire the abilities to be the masters of their own actions through increases in their ability to monitor increasingly coherent units of action and to correct activities in midstream.

Different types of change patterns related to each set of beliefs are pointed out. Discussion also focuses on how the nature of the change in parents' perceptions of their children's abilities varied with both the children's math ability levels and the changes in the children's assignment to different types of math classes. Data were  collected from parents in the fall and spring of children's years in 6th and 7th grades. Teachers rated students' math ability in the 6th grade. Various wave trends, including semester, year, and within-year changes, were analyzed. Findings indicated that children's transition to junior high school affected parents' ability estimates in English and math, with effects for math depending on children's ability in the subject. At the beginning of junior high, parents' ratings of the ability of low ability children increased, and their ratings of high ability children decreased. Parents' ratings were similar to students', and fathers' ratings were similar to mothers'. (RH)",

However, public policy fails to recognize that members of the populations targeted for these programs are often also members of the same family. This paper argues that a single program, constituting a family support service, can meet the needs of both parents and children. The discussion provides details of such a program, and explores (1) the needs of parents, in terms of requirements for program participation and  duration of child care assistance; (2) delivery systems, such as contracts, vouchers, and, with emphasis on its negative aspects, the Title IV-A Child Care Income Disregard; (3) costs of care; (4) children's needs; (5) school-age child care; (6) child care for children of adolescent parents; (7) transportation; and (8) the crisis in the overall supply of child care.

More boys than girls play with vehicles and blocks at home and in the preschool setting. More girls than boys are involved in art activities and dramatic play. The question might be: does the home play influence the preschool play or does the preschool play influence the home play or does the play of one setting reinforce and interact with the other.

It also suggests activities for parents which will enable both parents and children to increase awareness of television usage and the effects of television. Introductory materials discuss the television lifestyle of families, effects of different television programs, and parents' role in limiting the television viewing of children. How television influences children is discussed in terms of the absence of reality from television programs; superheroes and superhero play; functions and  consequences of television's audio track; television commercials; and the effect of television on children's development of self-discipline, slow deliberation, and interest in rewarding activities. What television teaches is discussed in terms of the learning of social values from television, ways television promotes behaviors hazardous to health, and stereotyping in television programing. Discussion of positive aspects of television focuses on ways television viewing can broaden horizons and offer opportunities to grow. Each subtopic in each section of the booklet is supplemented with suggested activities for parents which aim to increase their involvement in the use of television. (RH)",

Subjects were 21 undergraduate college students from a course on intellectual development taught at Tufts University (Massachusetts). Students were told to select some domain, such as juggling, photography, tennis, or chess; to study it for the term; and to reflect on their learning process during the semester. Data were obtained through weekly progress questionnaires completed by each subject after he or she had completed each lesson. Subjects rated their level of performance and assessed their feelings about their progress and overall level of ability. In  addition, subjects completed a preliminary background questionnaire that covered their \"metahobby\" choice and expectations for progress. Subjects' teachers were asked to rate their students' level of ability at the beginning, middle, and end of term. Findings supported the notion that a person systematically experiences various emotions when learning the skills necessary to move from novice status toward mastery status. An overall mixture of emotions was generally experienced at moderate levels of ability, while more pronounced exclusivity of positively and negatively valenced emotions occurred at higher levels of performance. Subjects who thought they would progress far did so. (RH)",

Broad research questions which formed the structure of the interviews focused on (1) informants' assumptions about how young children learn and develop; (2) how kindergarten classrooms were organized, children's tasks were structured, and instruction was delivered; (3) what the functions of kindergarten ought to be; (4) informants' program goals and objectives; and (5) informants' assumptions about literacy and how it is developed. Findings indicated a striking dichotomy between current theory in early childhood studies and  educational practice in the schools. Kindergartens in Ohio were increasingly academic and skill oriented. Individuals who implemented kindergarten programs experienced conflict between their own beliefs and what they were expected to do in practice. It is concluded that (1) Ohio's kindergarten programs are predominantly skill centered; (2) reading instruction in kindergarten is skill oriented; and (3) while a behaviorist orientation characterizes the kindergarten programs, 55.6 percent of all informants and 66.7 percent of teachers expressed philosophies other than behaviorism.

Data were obtained from 300 families, including 245 two-parent and 55 one-parent families. In the main outline of this model, the following order of latent factors was hypothesized: social class would influence child-rearing values and family climate, which would in turn influence parental feelings and cognitions in discipline situations; and these parental feelings and cognitions would in turn affect power assertion and induction. After four steps of LISREL-analysis, a fitting LISREL-model, which included correlated errors of measurement between pairs of variables, was  obtained. The resulting LISREL-model shows that parents with higher social status focused more on self-direction than conformity as a child-rearing value. A second major finding was that parents who focused on conformity tended to base their discipline reactions on behavioral norms and not on a positive understanding of the child's transgression. Norm orientation had a positive influence on power assertion. Also found was a direct influence of conformity as a child-rearing value on power assertion. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The widespread assumption that play enhances the quality of children's lives is investigated in this paper. Theorists and rsearchers have given the word &quot;play&quot; definitions which emphasize (1) its complexity and degree of approximaton of the adult world, (2) initial conditions and themes and motives that characterize the realization of different types of play, (3) outcomes, and (4) the extent to which players are governed by rules. Caillois (1979) defined play as an activity that is free, separate in time and space, uncertain, unproductive, regulated, and fictive. Huizinga (1939) viewed total involvement as the essence of play and the basis for the catharsis that players achieve. The consideration of the relation between play and quality of life begins with an investigation of  Baier's (1974) definition of 'quality of life' as the unspecified degree to which regional, physical, and social environments provide the conditions which allow for optimal life advancement. This definition facilitates thought about how play contributes to optimal life advancement. Since social structure and process determine the nature of play in a given sociocultural milieu, only onsite research can uncover the meaning of play in a given society and the connections between play and the quality of life.

        "description":"Recent studies have revealed that 5-year-old children can be induced to produce visually realistic drawings, either by manipulating the nature of the model which is being drawn, or by turning the drawing task into a communicative game. However, it has also been found that 5-year-olds cannot be induced to produce visually realistic drawings merely because they have been given highly explicit verbal instructions to do so. The present paper reports two experiments, both involving 160 subjects, which were designed to explore this matter further. The first experiment, which required that subjects draw either two balls or one cup, indicated that, contrary to previous findings, explicit instructions can sometimes elicit visually realistic drawings from 5-year-old children. The second  experiment, which required children to draw two balls, indicated that it is the content rather than the length of the explicit instructions which induces children to produce visually realistic drawings.

For each issue, he assumes that development proceeds through an ordered sequence of ontogenetic levels and that developmental progress has a high degree of inter-issue consistency. In contrast to the explicit assumptions about changes at the issue level, his empirical presentation relates mainly to the general course of development and does not systematically analyze issue-specific, intra-individual patterns of development. Reported here are data from a longitudinal study involving 73 children who were given a friendship interview when they were 9, 12, and 15 years of age. The interviews were analyzed separately for six  friendship issues in order to establish the degree of consistency and variability between both individuals and issues. A number of results contradict or supplement Selman's statements. It is concluded that descriptions of &quot;the general course of development&quot; may lead to biased accounts of developmental changes. (Author/RH)",

The present paper makes three points. First, Dirks' analyses were not appropriate to the research question, and hence provide no rigorous evidence justifying the conclusion. Second, even if the analyses had been appropriate, the most the experiment could possibly have demonstrated was that a game nearly identical to the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised (WISC-R) Block Design subtest could elevate subjects' scores on the subtest. Third, by employing two games of less but still substantial similarity to block design tasks, the present experiment found no evidence  of positive transfer to the Block Design Subtest of the Wechsler Preschool Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). Taken together, it would appear that, for the present, there is no rigorous evidence that games of any degree of similarity other than identity (test-retest effect) affect scores on the WISC-R or WPPSI subtests.

This reflection has identified skills required for their work as educators for which they have not been adequately trained. To identify skills considered crucial for a pre-service teacher in early childhood education, 40 early childhood educators in preschool education settings were interviewed and administered a questionnaire. Results showed that the skills required of the early childhood educator are numerous. The teacher's role goes well beyond the provision of custodial care, and requires planning in many aspects of children's development. Observation skills, planning  integration skills, and diagnosis of children's needs were rated as extremely important by the majority of the participating teachers. All participants indicated that parent conferences were important, but that they were not a priority in their training. In general, a variety of skill areas were identified as being important, indicating the complexity of the early educator's role. (RH)",

        "description":"Part of the Effective Programs for Students At Risk project, this study examines research findings concerning program effects on students attending either full-day or half-day kindergartens. Through use of the best-evidence synthesis technique, the study categorizes existing studies in terms of their methodological rigor and assigns most importance to the studies which are more rigorous. Findings indicate that under-achieving and disadvantaged students benefit from the additional instruction provided in full-day programs, but the benefits are found only on short-term measures. Disadvantaged students receiving additional instruction were the primary source of positive effects. No long-term effects were demonstrated. The synthesis suggests that the added time gained in a full-day  program may be valuable to disadvantaged students, but the type of instructional program provided may be even more important. It is concluded that future research should examine what types of kindergarten instructional programs are most effective for disadvantaged students. (Author/RH)",

Assessments were made in the classroom of the children's concepts of print, phoneme awareness, logo recognition, reading, and writing, through use of (1) the Metropolitan Readiness Tests, Early School Inventory: Preliteracy; (2) Hagtvet's Phoneme Awareness test; (3) Nurss' Logo Recognition task, (4) Hagtvet's Reading Tasks instrument; (5) writing tasks; and (6) performance during a curriculum unit on fairy tales. Findings indicated that the children needed more exposure to books, stories and \"language experience dictation\" to further develop print and story concepts. They required more opportunities  to write their own stories, messages, and captions. They needed continued opportunities to retell and dramatize stories using puppets and the flannel board. Correlations among variables suggested that aural skills of hearing and blending sounds have an important relationship to visual concepts of print, understanding of the reading task, and recognition of some whole words and symbols. Three data tables are included. (RH)",

Subjects were classified as impulsive, reflective, fast accurate, and slow accurate on the basis of performance on Form A of Wright's (1971) Kansas Reflective-Impulsive Scale for Preschoolers (KRISP). McDevitt and Carey's (1978) 100-item Behavioral Style Questionnaire (BSQ) was used to assess temperament. The questionnaire was filled out by a parent of each subject and includes separate scales for activity, adaptability, approach, distractibility, intensity, mood, persistence, rhythmicity, and threshold. Data indicated that errors on the KRISP were related to the personality variables  of activity, adaptability, and distractibility, but latency to first response scores on the KRISP were related to none of the personality variables. No significant differences were found for the four conceptual tempo groups or any of the nine temperament characteristics. It is concluded that conceptual tempo is relatively independent from temperament. (RH)",

Preschool directors were not surprised that only 45 percent of parents participating in a descriptive study used the public library as the primary source for books they read to their preschool children. They attributed parents' low level of library use to their relative affluence and disinclination to make the effort required to use the library. All directors provided children's books in the classroom, and made additional efforts to promote children's literacy, but none of the preschools had a library. Head librarians expressed  surprise and concern about the finding of low use by parents. They suggested that services for preschool children were insufficient and briefly described their programs for preschoolers, their parents, and caregivers, as well as special programs planned for the future.

The study is motivated by theories of production which hold that economies are available in large compared to small schools; it is pointed out, however, that larger schools may not take advantage of existing size economies or may take advantage in varied ways. The first section of the paper reviews ways in which the curriculum of a larger secondary school can differ from that of a smaller secondary school and notes reasons for expecting one type of difference rather than another. Topics include analysis of the relationships among educational services, variation in the mix of services, variation in the means employed to provide services,  and the cost of services. The second part of the paper presents an empirical assessment of the relationship between scale and the incidence of the various curricular responses. The conclusion discusses policy implications related to the findings of the study which make a convincing case for maintaining secondary enrollment levels at the 400-pupil level. (JHZ)",

The educational policy options from among which educational decision makers may choose include preserving the small school as a conscious educational choice, capitalizing on delivery systems, preparing teachers to use distance education, allocating instructional resources, assigning responsibilities for material/media selection, simplifying  logistics, and nurturing partnerships. Although most policies must be determined by local school boards, state educational units play a crucial role in influencing these policies by the way they meet responsibilities in determining state patterns of fiscal support, employment of statewide curriculum standards, regulations governing teacher certification/recertification, accreditation policies, provision of technical assistance to local districts, and ability to be a persuasive leadership force in articulating state educational goals. Thus the productive use of distance education will require not only sound and informed policy choices at each level independently but also joint and cooperative policy determinations. (NEC)",

        "description":"There are ways in which elementary teachers in general and rural elementary teachers in particular can overcome inadequate science preparation and can upgrade the science program resources of their small schools. Parents and children should be involved in obtaining free and inexpensive science-related materials throughout the year. These can be obtained from city institutions (museums and libraries), federal, state and county offices, and national and state parks, as well as colleges and universities and public interest groups. Several children's magazines are suggested. Materials should be arranged in a logical manner in order to be useful and effective. Six major categories (with possible divisions) are suggested: Chemistry, Biology, Earth Science, Astronomy, Physics and  Research Processes. Teaching modules containing materials, cross-references, equipment necessary, local places to visit, related references, lesson plans and activities, and tests should be compiled. The modules should be used from the receipt of the first materials and developed in an ongoing fashion. Other ways to improve K-6 programs are: videotaping television science programs, requesting science methods courses for small-school teachers, contacting interactive computer science teaching networks, and using the ERIC system.

        "description":"Data from a 1982 state-wide survey of 764 Louisiana farm households were analyzed to assess the relationship between conjugal work-role arrangements and four dimensions of farm family life: socio-demographic characteristics, scale and type of farm operation, farm and household decision-making and allocation of tasks, and subjective aspects of farm family life. Findings revealed over 50% of husbands and 33% of wives worked off farm; younger families had one or both spouse(s) employed off farm; presence of older children was positively associated with wives' off-farm employment; spouses working off farm had higher levels of education; a substantial proportion of reported income derived from non-farm earnings, with husbands employed off farm earning more than did other families.  Other findings indicated farm operations in which the husband only farmed were larger (in acreage and sales) than those in which the husband was employed off farm; farms where only the wife worked off farm were the largest; wives, regardless of labor status, reported working relatively few hours on the farm; allocation of daily family tasks/decisions generally followed traditional lines; couples expressed relatively high levels of satisfaction with life circumstances; and over 67% of couples sampled were uncertain or pessimistic about their future in farming.

        "description":"Understanding the way farmers respond to risk is a prerequisite for sound agricultural policymaking. Clarifying established agricultural economic theory to describe how individuals make choices among risky alternatives and providing a more precise set of concepts for studying behavior under risk contributes to such an understanding. A mathematically rigorous approach ensures that concepts are defined unambiguously and results are established decisively, and finds that individuals' preferences over an important class of risky alternatives are independent of preferences among certainties. Economic behavior under this type of risk cannot generally be predicted from behavior under certainty. Farmers' aversion to risk, or lack thereof, cannot invariably be determined from the shape of  their utility curve of income. Farmers' profit-maximizing choices of production inputs may differ from those traditionally thought to be dictated by classical theory, even when preferences satisfy the explicit assumptions of that theory. Separate sections examine lotteries; the existence, uniqueness, invariance, continuity, and decomposition of measurable utility functions; aspects of measurable utility on the real line; definitions of risk aversion and its relation to concavity; and economic applications to optimal production levels under price uncertainty and optimal saving rates under uncertainty.

        "description":"Teachers and administrators from three rural impoverished school districts in South Carolina, together with consultants and the principal investigator from Clemson University, identified seven requisite qualities of teachers: knowledge, instructional management, classroom management, communications skills, planning ability, professional qualities, and personal qualities. For each of the requisite qualities, a listing of from 10 to 15 objective teacher behaviors were written. For each of the objective behaviors, a subsequent listing of conventional and unobtrusive measures were developed. The primary purpose was to devise a practitioner developed evaluation scheme to improve the validity and acceptance of teacher incentive/merit pay plans based on the identified qualities and  measurement techniques. The technique yielded over 100 behavioral observations and the associated measurement procedures. The qualities and measurement strategies extend beyond the support of teacher incentive structures and have implications for an integrated professional personnel policy including recruitment, inservice, improvement, retention, promotion, incentive pay, and termination. Additionally, the structure could be the integral core of professional teacher training programs. Seventeen appendices, which comprise three-quarters of the document, contain materials produced by each of the 11 program task forces (evaluation, content/level mastery, instructional management, classroom management, communications, planning ability, professional qualities, personal qualities, schedules,  menu, and awards) as well as sample classified ads, interview questions, and demographic profiles.

Specific goals of the campaign are employment and economic self-sufficiency, improved literacy and educational attainment, reduction in the incidence of teenage pregnancy, lifestyles free from substance abuse, and reduction in violent and accidental injuries and deaths. Youth 2000 will not require new federal legislation but will instead be carried out using existing legislative authorities and resources. The federal role will be that of catalyst and partner. Youth 2000 is not a single, officially approved program model;  instead, it encompasses a wide variety of approaches that build on the needs and strengths of individuals, communities and families, tribal goals, and youth concerns. Youth 2000 will involve intensive public information campaigns, national conferences and other meetings to focus tribal leadership on youth issues, and the establishment and expansion of partnerships among federal agencies, foundations, and national Indian youth organizations to promote public and private sector support for American Indian youth.

        "description":"Written for educators, legislators, and the general public, this monograph is a resource for better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the one-teacher school. The material is designed to inspire more confidence in the quality of education possible in rural America and to reinforce recognition that most schools--regardless of size--can be educationally effective. The first chapter considers the one-teacher school within the framework of American education during the present century. This brief overview includes information about the effects of consolidation on rural education, the difficulties of attempting to compare rural and urban schools, and some of the techniques used by small schools to overcome the problems of isolation and small enrollment. Chapter 2 describes  and presents information about one-teacher schools today based on studies conducted over the past 3 years. Chapter 3 compares today's one-teacher schools with those of 1960 and charts their progress. Chapter 4 affords an opportunity to \"visit\" one-teacher schools through descriptions of selected schools. Chapter 5 details the evolution of primitive, log cabin schoolhouses to current, well-constructed buildings. The final chapter offers reflections on material in earlier chapters and makes recommendations about the future of one-teacher schools. (JHZ)",

        "description":"The differential interest costs to rural governments associated with borrowing in the tax-exempt bond market is a function of the advantageous position of several large partially rural counties and the dominance of school district borrowing in rural communities, rather than a disadvantage of predominantly rural governments. This conclusion is the result of a number of regression equations estimated from a unique 1982 data set that combines socioeconomic, financial, and governmental information. Of primary importance to rural development policymakers and practitioners is that highly rural governments paid rates roughly equivalent to the most urban borrowers on publicly offered debt issued during 1982. Suburban governments benefitted from lower interest rates than others on general  obligation (GO) bonds sold by nonschool governments, but they had no comparative advantage in issuing revenue bonds or school bonds. Nonschool governments located outside metropolitan areas, as a group, paid lower rates than did their metropolitan counterparts on GO bond issues. Like suburban issuers, nonmetropolitan issuers did not enjoy the same savings on their revenue and school bond sales. Rural governments were as successful in selling long-term municipal bonds as were urban governments during the volatile market of 1982. Rural interest rates were comparable to rates paid by urban issuers. (JHZ)",

Once a relationship is set up, the advantages for both the schools and business community could prove beneficial to the entire rural community. By cooperating with the rural schools in developing strong career and educational programs, the rural business community may not have to depend upon outside skilled help. Large businesses which form partnerships with rural schools are assuring their own future with the knowledge that the future work force may be the finished product of their involvement in quality education. Partnerships may be formed because of the mutual desire to improve the quality of education, the need to  uplift the morale of the educational system and the rural community regarding education, or the school's need for financial funding. A partnership can be initiated by either a school or a business, but successful business-school partnerships require total commitment from both parties. (JHZ)",

Fascinated by and indoctrinated with the pervasive electronic culture of the south, but still rooted in a distinctive northern lifestyle, they are living between different worlds, cultures and races. This resource publication is based on materials presented at the second meeting of the Northern Conference (Quebec, Canada, 1985) which sought creative, indigenous solutions to the problems confronting northern youth and explored innovative, aboriginal and community-based  alternatives to the present justice and child welfare approaches imported from southern Canada. The information is divided into eight modules: youth in the community; youth mental health; program initiatives for youth--creating alternatives; program initiatives for youth--teaching survival skills and cultural awareness; youth and the law; youth and the circuit court; youth in confinement--philosophies and programs; and; youth in care. Modules contain a summary of major issues, discussions among participants, a bibliography including audio-visual materials where appropriate, and information on program initiatives.

        "author":["Bagby, Susan Anne"],
        "description":"The migrant lifestyle, in which a student moves to a new school nearly three times per year, destroys the continuity of educational programs and contributes to abnormally high dropout rates. Educational testing can help improve educational continuity for migrant students by yielding valuable information about their levels of skills mastery so they can be placed at appropriate instructional levels. Three types of educational tests are in use: norm-referenced tests, criterion-referenced tests, and locator tests. Although often misused to measure short term academic gains, locator tests can quickly place migrant children within three months of their work level. One locator test, the Zip Test, is designed specifically for migrant students. It uses familiar experiences to allow  individual assessment of English language facility and rapid and reasonably accurate placement of children aged 5 to 12 in math and reading. Test bias and research problems make many tests inappropriate for minority migrant children. Conducting the longitudinal research necessary to establish a test's validity and reliability for migrant students is extremely difficult because of the students' high mobility. (NEC)",

        "description":"Education in, for, and about the outdoors is an effective way to develop students' knowledge and appreciation of their environment, to stimulate their curiosity, and to motivate them to learn. Steps involved in establishing an outdoor education program for public schools include: (1) gaining support of school teachers and administrators, parents, and community members; (2) drafting a definite plan with specific recommendations on site locations, topics of study, schedules for the school year, and estimated costs; and (3) securing funding. Although science subjects (biology and geology) are especially suited to outdoor education, traditional classroom subjects such as math, music, and language arts can be taught. Sites can include gardens, farms, cemeteries, city parks and  recreation areas, ponds, streams, forests, zoos, nature centers, fish hatcheries, and garbage dumps. Locations should have several types of topography or other unusual features, provide privacy, and have no hazards to students' safety. Administrative barriers to consider are class scheduling, transportation, and legal liability. Training in natural science, philosophy, and outdoor conservation can be provided for teachers through universities and existing outdoor education programs in 21 states. Eight sources of in-depth information on establishing an outdoor education program are listed. (NEC)",

        "description":"Exceptional Mexican American students face difficulties not experienced by their Anglo counterparts because the educational system is not set up to deal with members of ethnic and cultural minorities. Spanish-speaking students face the problem of gaining competence in their first language while learning English as a second language. Standard psychometric tests discriminate against cultural minorities. In particular, Mexican American students are apt to be misplaced in classes for the mentally handicapped or not identified if they are gifted. There is a shortage of certified bilingual teachers and of appropriate bilingual instructional materials. The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 encouraged bilingual-bicultural education and paved the way for programs that have improved  education for Mexican Americans. Research is being done to develop culturally valid tests for identifying gifted as well as handicapped minority students. Pluralistic evaluation, which combines psychometric assessment and adaptive behavior tests, is resolving the problem of misplacement of Mexican American students in special education classes for the mentally handicapped.

        "description":"To understand how to best motivate the Mexican American student, one must look not only to the factors considered relevant to achievement in mainstream Anglo American society, but also to specific problems faced by this minority group. Language barriers, cultural differences, economic background, and family attitudes combine to affect the educational and occupational aspirations of Mexican American students. Increased cross-cultural awareness by teachers is probably the key to motivating the Mexican American student. To begin with, since language is the most important manifestation of one's self, to deny the Mexican Americans' mother tongue is to deny their identity and thus eliminate motivation. Therefore, teachers of Mexican American students should be proficient in Spanish, to  enable communication in the students' mother tongue, which would provide shared experiences between teacher and students and establish a link between the students' highly valued family and home and their school. Teachers can help enhance self-esteem through a positive attitude toward Mexican Americans, reinforcing student strengths, and setting high standards for achievement. Motivational and occupational role models should be provided. Finally, teachers must be aware of the educational implications of the learning style of Mexican American students. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Described is a computer tutor designed to help students gain a qualitative understanding of important physics concepts. The tutor simulates a teaching strategy called &quot;bridging analogies&quot; that previous research has demonstrated to be successful in one-on-one tutoring and written explanation studies. The strategy is designed to remedy misconceptions by appealing to existing correct intuitions, and extending these intuitions by encouraging analogical thinking. The strategy was motivating and successful for some learning situations. Analysis of the data indicates those situations in which the strategy worked well and those where alternatives are needed. Implications for improving the tutor using artificial intelligence technology to incorporate a representation of student beliefs  and intelligent sequencing of example presentations are outlined.

It notes that affective, not cognitive, learning has traditionally been the primary objective of field instruction at all K-12 levels. Therefore, most educational research in field instruction has been mainly non-cognitive in nature. This document provides a summary of selected research that has had a connection with the cognitive gains possible in outside-the-classroom instruction, citing studies done in school situations, as well as in museums, zoos, and other novel settings. None of the studies reported in this document have made claims that out-of-classroom learning experiences are sufficient in themselves to produce significant cognitive gains with  elementary students. However, there is evidence to suggest that in-the-environment instruction is useful in promoting and achieving cognition gains when effectively planned and managed. Several suggestions for further research into this area are made. (TW)",

The first section provides a broad overview of the misconception literature and of the instructional implications associated with this body of research. Also included in the first section is a description of a computer-based approach designed to teach students how to translate algebraic word problems into equations. The second major section provides an  overview of the differences between experts and novices and discusses a computer-based approach in which students are constrained to analyze physics in expert-like ways. The computer-based example used relates to the analysis of classical mechanics problems. A 31-item list of references concludes the document. (TW)",

The University of Dayton Fast Track Program was designed to bring women with bachelor's degrees in mathematics, chemistry, or physics to a technical level in chemical or electrical engineering equivalent to bachelor degree recipients and to qualify them for master's degree work in chemical or electrical engineering. The program consisted of: (1) procedures to diagnose and evaluate backgrounds of participants; (2) examinations to determine placement in the mathematics sequence; (3) six credit hours of reentry mathematics taken by participants in the Chemical Track; (4) specific chemical and electrical core courses designed for, and made available  to, Fast Track students; (5) courses designed to integrate the students into the regular undergraduate curriculum in chemical and electrical engineering; (6) a Professional Development Course; (7) a tutorial center for Fast Track students; and (8) evaluation procedures. Seventy-one women were accepted into the Fast Track Program and 63 graduated. Seventy percent of the participants relocated to attend the Fast Track Program. Sixty-one women received employment, many with Fortune 500 companies. (TW)",

The qualitative physics problem given to the subject describes a situation where that which is unfamiliar is often solved by relating it to several analogous situations that are more familiar. Also described as important in creative problem solving are generating Gedanken experiments, generalizing and specializing, and generating extreme cases. This analysis suggests that three processes are essential in reasoning by analogy: (1) given the initial conception A, the analoguous conception B must &quot;come to mind&quot;; (2) the analogy relation must be &quot;confirmed&quot;; and (3) conception B must be &quot;confirmed.&quot; The paper also identifies three  major questions to be considered in future research: (1) how do analogous cases come to mind?

According to the outcome approach, the goal in questions of uncertainty is to predict the outcome of an individual trial. Predictions take the form of yes/no decisions of whether an outcome will occur on a particular trial. These predictions are then evaluated as having been either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot; Additionally, predictions are often based on a deterministic model of the situation. In follow-up interviews using a different set of problems, responses of outcome-oriented subjects were predicted. In one case, subjects' responses were at variance with  the &quot;representativeness heuristic.&quot; While the outcome approach is inconsistent with formal theories of probability, its components tend to be logically consistent and reasonable in the context of everyday decision making.

In addition, the document distinguishes between qualitative and quantitative competence in physics. These competencies are illustrated through questions that students are expected to answer for two problems (a crane boom and a stone throw problem) and approaches are described that are consistent with each type of competence. An example is described which demonstrates that an approach that leads to competence in qualitative reasoning emphasizes pedagogic and conceptual knowledge, and an approach that leads to competence in quantitative reasoning is an expert system which emphasizes  problem solving and factual knowledge. Two ways to categorize the knowledge of a physics tutor are presented. The first consists of facts, skills, and concepts, and the second distinguishes between expert and pedagogic knowledge.

Children combine simple graphic commands to get a display screen cursor (called a turtle) to draw designs on the screen. The purpose of this study was to examine young children's abilities to function in a simple computer programming environment. Four- and five-year-olds were asked to solve turtle graphics problems requiring two or three commands for a solution. There were two programming-type conditions. First, children were asked to give the complete sequence of commands in advance (i.e., generate a program). Second, if the sequence did not work, they were asked to determine what went wrong and modify it accordingly (i.e., debug their program). Results of the study indicate that young  children had difficulty in generating two- or three-command programs. Their ability to debug their own incorrect programs was not as high as expected. Several implications for educators are discussed. Tables and figures are provided. (TW)",

        "description":"In the teaching of physics, the study of electricity and magnetism typically follows the introduction of the basic concepts of mechanics. However, there are some new concepts associated with electromagnetic fields that seem at first to the student to be unrelated to, or even incompatible with, Newton's third law as learned in mechanics. Furthermore, the transition from electrostatics to studies of moving charges and associated magnetic phenomena seems to many thoughtful students not to be consistent with concepts learned earlier in the course. This report describes approaches to electrostatics, to elementary circuits, and to the effects of moving charges in a way designed to be fully consistent throughout, so that the student is not left with quandaries about the relationship of  each set of basic concepts to the other sets in the course. Included are chapters on: (1) qualitative reasoning; (2) basic electricity; and (3) electromagnetic induction and relativity. The text is supported throughout by interactive and animated computer graphics. A bibliography is also included. (Author/TW)",

The five major goals of the project were met, and 22 essential competencies for computer literacy among science teachers were identified. The model and materials developed tended to be successful in improving the skills, knowledge, and attitudes of science teachers. Results of the project were disseminated by workshops, papers at professional meetings, publicity releases, and published articles. The materials developed and summarized in this document include: (1) a teacher enhancement model that applies to implementing any educational innovation; (2) a definition of what it means to be a computer-literate science teacher; (3)  strategies for implementing educational computing; (4) materials and approaches that continue in use without outside support; and (5) a determination of the appropriate use of microcomputers in teaching science. Appendixes, which make up two-thirds of the document, include lists of contributors to ENLIST Micros, evaluation instruments, materials pertaining to the dissemination activities, and responses to the use survey conducted as part of the study.

Tape recordings made of 24 upstate New York high school biology and chemistry classes on 6 different occasions during the 1985-1986 school year were analyzed by a panel of expert judges. Each interaction in the randomly selected 10-minute period was classified and the interactions were accumulated. Results of the analysis of these data indicated that observation variables could be  grouped into scales that discriminated between teachers, and that the scales were meaningful. (TW)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to describe student perceptions within high school classes in biology and chemistry over the course of a school year. The sample consisted of 435 high school college preparatory science students who were enrolled in 44 different biology and chemistry classes in central New York State. Measurements of attitude toward science and perceptions of the classroom environment were made with 33 Likert-type items drawn from other instruments. The results indicated that science attitudes become worse during the school year. According to the perceptions of the students, two thinking variables, creative exploration and logical thinking, decreased during the school year. Creative exploration, which involves divergent thinking, was significantly different between  chemistry student's perceptions and the biology students' perceptions, with chemistry students indicating that lower levels of creative exploration occur in those classes. The results also indicated that many of the correct answers in chemistry may be obtained by using logical thinking and problem solving techniques, whereas biology students quickly learn that success is obtained by remembering large amounts of information.

The first experiment tested sensitivity to loss in altitude and demonstrated that: (1) preview effects led to adaptation; (2) sensitivity decreased with higher flow rates; and (3) sensitivity increased with higher optical texture densities and fractional loss. The second and third experiments examined the perception and control of change in forward speed and altitude, respectively. Results from the former indicated that higher levels of fractional loss led to enhanced control of a constant speed, whereas high flow and/or edge rates interfered with performance. The control of altitude change was similarly affected by the levels of fractional loss, but the negative effect of flow rate occurred only in conditions of descending flight.  Theoretical implications for the ecological approach to the study of perception and control are discussed. (Author)",

While previous research on black private household workers usually attributed changes in household labor to architectural and technological trends, this data indicated that the transition from live-in servant to day worker occurred as a result of the women's desire for less restrictive employment. Oral histories of 23 black women, who made this transition, challenge the belief that household workers lacked the initiative and ability to control employment conditions. Southern relatives' roles, the Washington community, churches, and pre-migration experiences are examined, along with the  consequences of the transition in relation to the women's self-esteem. Results indicate that the family, with its inherent roles and values, remained crucial to these women despite differences between their rural upbringing and urban employment. (Author/JHP)",

The study focused on: (1) general educational goals; (2) curriculum; (3) testing; (4) graduation requirements; (5) state level funding; (6) instruction; and (7) the influence of current educational developments on arts education. Results indicated that 50 SEAs employ art specialists or allocate a portion of generalists' responsibilities to art education. Thirteen states have written arts education goals, and 43 states distribute curriculum guidelines and supplementary  materials for arts instruction to local school districts. Achievement in arts education in 10 states is determined through standardized testing, and 22 states have graduation requirements in the arts. Forty-two states require arts certification for teachers of grades K-12 in two or more arts subjects. An arts education historical review is presented, and a final section focuses on the impact of current educational issues on arts education. Most respondents to the Arts and the Schools Project questionnaire believed that the formulation of new policies at the state level would lead to improved arts instruction. Recommendations include establishing arts education as an essential component of all children's education and encouraging SEAs to include arts in formal education goals.

        "description":"Roman Catholic schools in the United States have made significant contributions which include the first schools in many geographic areas, the first textbook in the United States, and the first dictionaries of some Indian languages. Early attempts to establish Catholic schools led to incidents which required heroism of the leaders and sacrifices by the laity. The U.S. Catholic schools had their roots in European Catholic countries and, as a result, the first schools in the western hemisphere were located in Spanish and French territories. The growth of the 13 British colonies set the pattern for the future development of the colonies and the U.S. public school systems. At the time, Catholics were regarded as an insignificant and powerless minority. The U.S. Constitution's First  Amendment has led to the United States being the only country in the western hemisphere which prohibits religious observances in public schools. From 1783-1828, U.S. Catholics, while facing hostility, poverty, and the frontier wilderness, established an educational philosophy and school organizational pattern. Because of immigration and westward expansion, the period of 1829-1884 was one of growth and expansion in contrast to the years 1885-1917, which were characterized by instability and slower growth due to the rise of materialism, pragmatism, naturalism, and Darwinism. Catholic schools defended their right to exist in the 1918 Code of Common Law. This right was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Pierce versus Society of Sisters. Since 1957, the Catholic schools in the United States  have stressed education to the inner city underprivileged. Suggested teaching formats for use of this material are included. (JHP)",

        "description":"The Visual Arts Program of the National Endowment of the Arts undertook a survey to determine the economic conditions of artists and the processes by which they exhibit works in four cities located outside the major art centers of New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The selected market areas included Houston, Minneapolis, Washington, and San Francisco. Research indicated that these cities have significant markets for locally produced art, which is mainly sold by galleries and museums. However, artists are dissatisfied with exhibition opportunities, especially with lengthy waiting periods. Among various methods used to locate exhibition opportunities, personal contacts are most used, and service organizations are least utilized. The data indicated major differences between  the artists and exhibitors on the perception of fairness in the exhibition selection process. Obtaining studio space is a major problem for artists in all four cities, and both artists and exhibitors advocate public acquisition of buildings which could be rented for studio space. Few artists earn a living solely from art sales. Most hold other jobs or are supported by another person. Median art income for the artists sampled was $718 in 1978. Median production costs were $1,450, approximately twice the median income. Tables and figures are included. (JHP)",

        "description":"Many classical pianists want to develop jazz piano skills because they have acquired: (1) an awareness of the importance of jazz as an art form; (2) an attraction to the sophistication and complexity of jazz music; (3) an interest in exploring contemporary music styles; and (4) a desire to become involved with a type of music which is viewed as enjoyable. This study addresses the need for a short course in basic jazz piano skills oriented toward the special interests, skills, and attitudes of adult pianists and attempts to determine if a mastery learning theory approach can be applied as the basis of instruction. A course designed on this principle has specific objectives and is organized into small, sequential units in which student mastery is carefully monitored. Based on a  review of mastery learning theory, a five session, 15 hour course was designed, developed, and taught to two groups of four adult students. An evaluation of student achievement was conducted during 1985 and 1986. Results indicated that: (1) all students reached the mastery level of achievement on the posttest; (2) 75% of the students reached the predetermined mastery level of performance concerning seventh chords; (3) 88% of the students achieved mastery level in improvisation; and (4) all students acquired more positive attitudes toward their own improvisational ability.

        "description":"Farming and food related businesses generate one out of five jobs in the private economy and account for about 20 percent of the gross national product. These instructional materials, designed for use in secondary schools, encourage students to explore the significance of farming to the U.S. economy and the major problems confronting U.S. agriculture. Problems in the agricultural sector create a ripple effect with three nonagricultural jobs lost for every agricultural job lost. The nation's farm problem is the result of human politics and economics. They are rooted in the 1930s and are based on the notion that all farms are alike and that government benefits flow equally to all farms. Large farms represent less than five percent of all farm operations, but they produce almost  half of the national farm product. Almost 30 percent of all farm subsidies go to the largest one percent of all producers. A small percentage of the nation's farmers get the bulk of government cash supports. The fact that a large population can be fed through the efforts of a smaller fraction of the labor force is vivid testimony to the accomplishments of farm technology. If the solutions proposed in the 1930s are no longer appropriate to the 1980s, there is as yet no consensus about what the current direction and policy toward farming should be. (SM)",

        "description":"This booklet, designed for use by secondary social studies students and adult groups, describes three perspectives held by different groups on the immigration issue and examines the arguments for and against each of the arguments. The broadest and largest stream of immigrants since the 1920s has flowed into the United States since 1965. The perspective of the restrictionists is explored first. A chief concern of people holding this view is that newcomers may displace U.S. workers, depress wages, and contribute to poor working conditions. This is especially true of undocumented workers. The second group views immigration as beneficial to the United States. Members of this group hold that fears about &quot;overcrowding&quot; are hardly persuasive. The United States has the lowest population  density of any developed nation. Also, immigrants do not take jobs; they make jobs. Studies have found that immigrants provide economic benefits. The third viewpoint concerns whether or not the immigrants can be assimilated into the culture. The United States is the sum total of a vast number of national differences. Members of the third group ask whether pluralism is at odds with U.S. interest in maintaining a core of common values, symbols, and social commitments. They point out that about one-half of all the people now coming to the United States speak Spanish. The United States has never before tried to absorb so many newcomers speaking the same foreign language. Among people who share this view, the concern is that Hispanics may remain a culture outside U.S. mainstream culture.  (SM)",

        "description":"This booklet, designed for use in secondary social studies classes and adult groups, explores the differing perspectives on the causes and prevention of violent crime. The problem, according to the first perspective, is that the sharp increase in crime is due to the absence of punishment. The most promising solution is to get tougher with all criminals, increase enforcement efforts, appoint tougher judges, impose longer jail sentences, and build more prisons. The second view of crime and punishment is that there needs to be an identification of the relatively small group of criminals who are high-rate offenders, and a recognition that in important ways they are not deterred by harsher prison sentences. Chronic offenders need to be taken off the streets. The third perspective  proposes that it is necessary to look at the corrosive social and economic forces that lead to criminality and make a serious effort not just to contain crime, but to prevent it. Proponents of this position recognize that it is no small task to change the social and economic conditions which now provide a breeding ground for crime. As an immediate measure, alternatives to incarceration should be explored. If a society that is less dangerous, less fearful, and less torn by violence is to be built, the causes and prevention of crime must be considered. (SM)",

Goals of the study were to identify the characteristics of persons who stated: (1) a desire to increase their attendance at arts events; and (2) different reasons for not increasing their attendance at such events. Data from the 1982 and 1985 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts were used to investigate these areas of interest. Findings indicated that there is a strong desire among U.S. adults to attend arts events and that this desire is related to both prior level of attendance at performing arts events and a variety of socio-economic characteristics. Other factors include: (1)  interest in mass media; (2) involvement in art lessons; and (3) participation in other types of leisure and recreational activities. People who have a stronger desire to attend more arts activities tend to be younger, more educated, and more affluent than their nonparticipating counterparts. Time factors, cost, and nonavailability are most often named as barriers to increasing attendance. Future studies should focus on other activities which compete with arts for people's time and money.

Craft organization members have a different demographic and socioeconomic profile from the general adult population. Fifty-five percent work on a vocational basis, while 45 percent pursue crafts as leisure activities. Generally, craft-artists who subscribe to craft publications that are not published by craft membership organizations plan to take more craft training and  desire to learn business skills. Profit-oriented craftsmen are concerned about their lack of craft knowledge, markets, and personal recognition. Leisure time concerns of craft-artists include pressures from non-craft obligations, lack of training, and material costs. In order to understand both folk and avant-garde craft-artists, their work must be studied within the contexts of cultural heritage, time periods, and ethnic backgrounds. Figures are included.

Subjects, 1,290 elementary and middle school students in a midwest state, completed the Measure of Elementary Communication Apprehension (MECA). Academic Achievement was determined from scores on the Stanford Early Achievement Test for kindergarten subjects, the Metropolitan Readiness Test for subjects in grade 1, and the Stanford Achievement Test for subjects in grades 2-8. Since students across grade levels completed three different  achievement tests, separate statistical tests were conducted. The results provided partial support for the hypothesis. The hypothesis was not supported for students in kindergarten and grade 1. Analyses of mathematics and reading achievement test scores for students in grades 2-8 provided support for the hypothesis. The findings did not support the contention that students high in CA achieve at levels comparable to those of students moderate in CA, but did suggest that students low in CA achieve at levels comparable to students moderate in CA.

Six hundred teachers elected to attend one-and-a-half day workshops, 180 teachers attended workshops requiring 10 full days' participation, 200 teachers ordered materials by mail, and 400 teachers took advantage of a museum's sponsorship of selected program activities for groups of students. Questionnaires were sent to a sample of the teachers in each group. The responses indicated that those attending the short workshops used the materials and activities at a higher rate, and introduced them to others at a higher rate, than did teachers in other groups. Participants in the museum program showed the least use.  Differences among the teachers making up the groups appeared to have greater impact on use than did the presentation format. Analysis showed that teachers selecting short workshops were less likely to have master's degrees and more likely to attend professional meetings and to participate on curriculum and textbook adoption committees. They appeared more interested in the professional benefits of the workshop than in the larger number of academic credits associated with the larger workshop. (PGD)",

Among the factors cited here are, first, that recent major reform efforts have created no barriers to including critical thinking among educational objectives, but that attempts to realize these reforms through rules, regulations, and standards may be creating conditions that are detrimental to critical thinking. Second, many of today's teachers are not competent to teach in their subject areas, let alone to approach those subjects critically; moreover, economic and other conditions make it unlikely that great numbers of competent teachers will soon be  entering the profession. Third, it is essential that critical thinking not become an end in itself; rather, it must be learned in the context of subject matter. Fourth, creative imagination should be considered a worthy educational goal along with critical thinking, since the two interact to produce insight and discovery. This transcript of a talk on these matters includes answers to several specific questions raised by listeners in response to comments in the main body of the address. (PGD)",

This document reviews 17 conceptions of learning style. Each conception has been examined in terms of the definition put forward, the number of learning style elements encompassed, the categories into which the elements are distributed, the individuals involved in applying the concept, and the instruments used in the course of this application. This analysis led to the identification of  three continua as critical for fixing the essential differences among the conceptions: the first specified the grade levels served, the second the number of learning characteristics encompassed, and the third the extent to which learning style strengths are taught exclusively or are used to develop new strengths. By developing inservice programs that build upon a systhesis of these conceptions rather than on one alone, administrators will enable teachers to choose more wisely among the concepts and approaches available.

An informal research effort indicated that there are probably 1,500 to 1,750 such educators in the professional schools, examination services, and professional societies of North America. These educators can fill roles on service staffs or as teachers, consultants, researchers, project developers, or administrators, among others. They must be resourceful, capable of grasping new fields of study quickly, bright, tough, politically and diplomatically astute, able to sell, and knowledgeable about education generally. Such educators  find dissemination of their work difficult since they frequently seek to address two audiences at once: educators in general and noneducator professionals in their chosen specializations. These educators receive substantial benefits from their positions but also frequently find themselves regarded as secondary in status to the full professionals in their subject areas. Their teaching colleagues are usually professionals untrained in pedagogy. In the immediate future it is likely that increasing budgetary restrictions will place considerable pressure on such educators to justify their existences and meet outside demands for productivity.

The findings are based on data from the as yet incomplete 3-year District/Secondary School Study. This research effort involved urban comprehensive high schools without special admissions requirements and with significant numbers of students drawn from minority and low income groups. Some schools were examined intensively through interviews, observations, and analysis of records; others participated only in limited interviews. The paper first reviews relevant elements of school effectiveness theory and organizational excellence theory. The researchers sought data on dependent variables reflecting school performance outcomes and  independent variables reflecting the presence of characteristics found in the effectiveness and excellence theories. District policies and community characteristics were also considered. This paper reports that the school-related organizational characteristics suggested by the effectiveness and excellence theories are not present in all schools. The research further found that schools varied in the extent to which the district participated directly in school administrative decisions. The relationship between these findings and school performance is not reported because the research is not yet complete, but preliminary analysis suggests that some relationship may be found. (PGD)",

        "description":"There are no simple answers to the tricky business of managing conflict within organizations. Almost every conflict is a unique case with its own issues, participants, dynamics, and consequences. Still, it appears possible to differentiate between organizations that handle conflict productively and those that do not. Successful organizations view conflict in neutral terms, use conflict to energize leadership, leave conflict as stronger organizations, and develop systems for handling rather than ignoring conflict. Conflict can lead to several outcomes: deadlock, the victory of one side and defeat of the other, compromise, the integration of both points of view in a new solution, or a purposeful decision to sidestep the conflict altogether. Each of these outcomes is suitable to  particular situations; none is appropriate to all; and some are more difficult to achieve than others. The characteristics that seem most positively related to an organization's ability to resolve conflict productively include having an open organizational climate; maintaining clear, accepted organizational goals and roles; establishing effective problem-solving mechanisms; keeping communication and feedback systems operating; equalizing power among internal groups; encouraging innovation; and developing cohesiveness and mutual trust among organization members.

This paper contends that the alignment of objectives, actual teaching, and the means and content of testing are essential to effective schooling. The logical arguments of three authorities--Wilbur Brookover, Alan Cohen, and George Behr--are presented in support of the idea of alignment. Four techniques suggested for approaching the alignment problems recognize the complexities of the school context and the probable necessity of dealing with some of the elements of alignment as prerequisites. These are: (1) spelling out the implications of goals and objectives in behavioral terms; (2) content analysis of tests; (3) instructional  program analysis; and (4) curriculum program analysis. The fifth approach, that of goal and objective formulation, is presented to show that alignment questions must be addressed from the very beginning. The paper concludes by advising that the entire curriculum and instructional program of a school or district cannot be subjected to an alignment effort simultaneously. Provided there is an overall scheme, the program can be examined and adjusted in sections. (MLF)",

Since off-campus students must exhibit a certain level of independence and self-guidance to succeed, it might be more reasonable to tailor educational experiences to exploit the possibilities of independent study, including the individual life situations in which students find themselves. This focus on independence and personal experience is also characteristic of Edgar Faure's concept of lifelong learning, which encourages learning from informal as well as formal sources, learning guided by learners, and concern with real-world experiences and problems. Some aspects of the lifelong learning  model that are not typically included in distance education programs are: (1) using formative assessment of student progress, (2) tailoring learning strategies to individual situations, and (3) using real-world criteria in evaluations. It appears possible and desirable for distance education programs to incorporate sucessfully many more of the characteristics of lifelong learning than has typically been the case, but evidence from the field suggests that strong pressures exist in favor of using conventional educational approaches.

Developing instructional methods to meet these needs is important if the quality of distance education is to be high. Schools established solely to provide distance education, such as Britain's Open University or Canada's Athabasca University, are committed to instructional development and the adequate training of instructors. But schools that provide a conventional, campus-based program and a distance program too often treat the distance program as merely an inferior version of the traditional program and give only token recognition to the special needs of the students. The University of  Waterloo in Ontario offers distance education to 6,000 of its 25,000 students and has a small office of instructional development. This office has worked with other campus offices and departments on several projects, including conducting a major research study of program students, organizing workshops for both students and teachers, developing study skills materials for students, and consulting on preparation of an instrument for evaluating distance education. Still incomplete but in process is an effort to improve course design for distance education. (PGD)",

Although distance education has relied more extensively on technological means for delivering education to its students than has traditional classroom-centered education, most distance programs use technology only to the extent that different modes of transmitting education are required by circumstances. Major efforts to use broadcast media, satellite transmission, or computer networking as basic modes of delivery have been limited to schools where distance education is the central emphasis. In most other cases, including the University of Waterloo in Ontario (where the administrative uses of computers and the extent of computer  education efforts have been particularly important), costs and logistics have limited efforts to design and produce computer-based instructional delivery systems for off-campus students. Areas in which such effots can be expected to bear fruit first include the speeding up of communication between students and schools, and the introduction of computer education courses relying on student-owned equipment. In any case, the technology should not serve as a reason to change delivery systems, but as a means for doing so. (PGD)",

The inadequacies of student achievement tests as measures of educational effectiveness will lead to a shift of interest away from tests and toward the abilities of students to solve problems, use learning strategies successfully, and structure knowledge. Examination of the methods teachers use to develop these abilities in students, as well as to motivate students, should be a central feature of evaluation in the future. Evaluation itself can be improved by increasing the amount of data upon which evaluations are based, including data generated by the teachers themselves; developing more reliable systems for obtaining students' responses to  instruction; and maintaining a positive tone in evaluations to provide encouragement to teachers. The future of evaluation will also turn on the effects of evaluation processes on institutions in their entirety, including the effects of frequency of evaluation and the effects of evaluating teachers as opposed to curricula.

Technology-push involves creating new technologies before markets are identified; demand-pull strategies focus on identifying user needs and developing technologies to meet them. The hybrid approach identifies existing applications of technology in one field and forecasts their future applicability to situations in another field. Five steps are involved: (1) defining the technology, (2) identifying current uses of the technology, (3) obtaining specialists' views  of the potential applicability of the current uses to new settings, (4) rating the scenarios developed in the previous step according to their chances for success, and (5) disseminating information about the potential uses found.

Unfortunately, it is not always easy to determine when children should be allowed freedom and when they need regulation, and on occasion teachers may overstep reasonable bounds in either direction. The teachers' behaviors in these cases may be seen as the results of interpreting the situations in question using patterns of response developed earlier in life. To understand why these situations are inappropriately interpreted, teachers must review their own pasts and identify the incidents that gave rise to those patterns of response, then analyze the reasons behind the  relationships between the incidents and the response patterns. A promising tool for this self-study is the autobiography. Ideally the autobiographical text will consist of responses made during an interview, since the respondent is less likely under interview conditions to find ways to present the past in a self-serving light. The autobiographical material can then be analyzed by the teacher for clues to his or her present behavior. (PGD)",

This program was initiated because of the district's anticipated need for a large number of new administrators, coupled with the availability of numerous top teachers for administrative training and the preference of the district for administrators who are attuned to the local culture and district philosophy. It also served the needs of the university for greater exposure to public school systems, and it provided them with an effective way to revise their curriculum. In developing the model for the program, the first step was to review the administrative/supervisory curriculum in order to determine  which courses should be strictly preservice and which could be either preservice or inservice courses. The latter courses were completely revised by teams consisting of university and school district personnel, so that they could be delivered in discrete modules to working staff. Admission requirements and program costs are discussed, and tables are interspersed throughout the text to illustrate the structure of the preservice and inservice curricula. (TE)",

Accordingly, the paper begins with a summary of the basic concepts of sociobiology, and then shows how these concepts are compatible with a number of theories already applied in education, such as those of Piaget, Kohlberg, Chomsky, and Jung, which describe certain inherited behavioral or psychological patterns. A central concern of sociobiologists is an inquiry into the natural selection processes that govern the evolution of human culture. Elements of  culture--&quot;memes&quot; which can be communicated but not subdivided--are selected according to some criterion of value. The major tasks that sociobiologists face are: (1) describing the nature of these &quot;memes&quot; or bits of culture, which then evolve in a competitive process; and (2) identifying the values--based on inherited predispositions--that determine the survival of one set of memes over another.

        "description":"This paper presents a set of arguments in support of maintaining a cabinet-level Department of Education. It first traces the history of the federal role in education, which was established early in the history of the United States and has evolved over the decades through a series of specific responses to the nation's educational needs. It has never been as a comprehensive plan to nationalize American education. The next chapter presents a threefold rationale for federal involvement in education: to broaden access to education, to enhance the quality of education, and to provide financial assistance to local school districts. Federal education programs are needed because (1) state and local agencies are unable or unwilling to protect the political, economic, and educational  rights of the disadvantaged; (2) improvement of the education system is a constant and important goal; (3) the federal government's tax base is broader, and its taxes are less regressive than state and local taxes; and (4) certain activities, such as research and information collection and dissemination, are solely national level functions. A series of appendixes provide a fact sheet on the Reagan Administration's proposals to dismantle the Department of Education and a summary of the accomplishments of the department, along with a letter to Congress describing right-wing attacks on the Department of Education, and a list of national associations supporting the Department of Education Coalition.

        "description":"This document reports on a study undertaken to identify specific behaviors of secondary school principals that are effective or ineffective in promoting positive school characteristics. The researchers first searched the literature to find an organizational model that would take into account the organization's goals, the means for measuring achievement of the goals, and the factors responsible for their achievement. The literature was further searched to determine accepted characteristics of effective schools. Eight characteristics were identified: recognition of achievement, a positive environment, articulation of the curriculum, support for instruction, high expectations, collaborative planning, instructional leadership, and parental involvement. A modified version of the  Critical Incident Technique was then used to interview 55 individuals in Oregon and Kentucky who had had frequent opportunities to observe administrators. These observers cited over 1,000 instances of effective and ineffective principal behavior. The researchers and a panel of experts agreed that 335 of these were related to specific school characteristics, either positively or negatively, and found another 315 to be either effective or ineffective in relation to more than one characteristic. The document contains a discussion of how these 650 behaviors relate to the eight school characteristics and to the principal's organizational leadership role. Appendices include a four-page bibliography and statistical tables. (PGD)",

After two brief introductory chapters that set forth the scope of the issue, the third chapter provides the following general guidelines for discipline programs in effective schools: establish high expectations for student behavior; develop clear rules; apply the rules consistently; praise as well as punish; don't disrupt learning; suspend only as a last resort; don't let students be anonymous; and plan to avoid future misbehavior. The fourth chapter addresses legal codes and issues pertaining to discipline in the Chicago Public Schools. The fifth chapter is a discussion of alternatives for school  discipline programs, while the sixth chapter provides advice and precautions for evaluating a school's discipline program. The final chapter, &quot;Take Action,&quot; sets forth general principles and tactics to follow in bringing about needed changes in school discipline.

        "description":"This analysis examines the factors associated with a positive attitude toward the funding of local schools. Using data from a 1984 survey of 1,000 Illinois residents, the analysis found that attentiveness to local school issues was the strongest predictor of a positive attitude toward school spending. Suburban residents were less likely to be concerned about the level of school funding than were other Illinois residents, but this may reflect the relatively better funding base for suburban schools. Middle-income respondents in Chicage were significantly more likely to see public schools as underfunded than were other Chicago or Illinois residents, while middle-income residents of downstate areas were the least likely to see their schools as underfunded. The analysis concludes  that, given the large impact of attentiveness on spending attitudes, it is important for local school leaders to identify and work with school attentives and that scholars should seek to better understand the sources and patterns of attentiveness to local schools.

After a brief introduction that describes recent changes in the ecclesiastical and organizational context of the Catholic school principalship, the first chapter recommends procedures for use in recruiting qualified program applicants and provides a list of required qualities and competencies. It also suggests procedures for screening and assessing qualified applicants, interviewing them, and making a decision. The second chapter lists curricular topics and NCEA resources for a Catholic principals' training program, and discusses various  approaches to teaching and learning. The third chapter presents a policy and design for evaluation of both the candidate and the training program itself. The conclusion briefly discusses five additional items of concern for sponsors of a Catholic principals' preparation program: record keeping, resources (both material and human), participant recognition, participant placement, and geographical and financial accessibility.

Five major examples of credit for planned off-campus experiences include (1) enrollment in courses at other institutions; (2) joint enrollment programs with community colleges or technical schools; (3) training internships with community or government agencies; (4) work-study cooperative  programs; and (5) travel or enrichment programs. Attendance options and systematic planning considerations for development of credit alternatives are also listed. The second section, &quot;Awarding Credit for Off Campus Experiences,&quot; describes an experience-based career education program in Dawson County and Franklin County High Schools (Georgia). It discusses present Georgia policies in relation to awarding credit and how the procedures developed in this project might be helpful to policymakers in credit determination for community-based learning programs in their own schools.

The self-fulfilling prophecies held by teachers, administrators, and others for their students and the self-concepts the students hold for themselves are two major psychological notions that serve as a base for educational concerns. Using the mass of recent national reports on school improvement as its point of reference, this paper offers the following 10 strategies for improving the school climate: (1) make students feel important, (2) make students feel invited, (3) deal with needed changes in others from a positive point of view, (4) learn to make appropriate nonverbal cues, (5) get to know each  student personally, (6) learn to empathize, (7) establish parameters, (8) use student-centered instruction, (9) learn to know and understand the difference between discipline and punishment, and (10) be enthusiastic about teaching.

Recent polls reflect a serious decline in the public view of education, and the resulting confidence gap has created much difficulty for American public schools. A national commission established by Phi Delta Kappa to study this problem used survey cards and questionnaires to gather data from the identified schools. Preliminary results showed that public confidence at both the building and district levels was largely determined by teacher and administrator attitudes. Other important factors were special programs, building and grounds, and student achievement. These results suggest that  schools could improve their public relations by working directly on attitude improvement and by developing programs and efforts based on periodic needs sensing techniques.

The hiring of these people may be attributed primarily to the unwillingness of certified staff members to coach because of dissatisfaction with various aspects of the job, especially the time required, the relatively low compensation, and the attitude of students. The use of non-faculty coaches has increased more than 400 percent between 1977-1978 and 1983-1984. Seventy percent of small high schools in Wisconsin employ them. Administrators have expressed general  satisfaction with the performance of non-faculty coaches, believing their employment necessary for the existence of adequate athletic programs. The chief problems arising from the use of these coaches lie in the area of effective supervision of students and the need to relate athletics to the overall school program. (Author/TE)",

This system, known as Project Support, provided information models in order to foster a capacity for a comprehensive State Department of Education dissemination system. The dissemination system provided information to local school system personnel and department personnel in a usable format and within a time frame necessary for responding to immediate needs. The activities of the project and department have focused on providing technical assistance to practitioners in the use of information. The project has also used the teacher centers in the state as linkers. An advisory committee was also established to provide assistance in the  implementation of the project. After an introductory overview of these activities, a detailed comparison is provided of dissemination activities in Tennessee before 1978 and at the conclusion of the grant. This is followed by a discussion of the institutionalization of dissemination activities, the approach to equity issues, and the effects of the project. Findings and recommendations derived from the dissemination project are then enumerated and discussed. A bibliography is included, and supporting materials are appended, along with a description of Tennessee's Career Ladder Program. (TE)",

The background of the program is discussed, and requirements of the state's master plan are outlined. Noted are findings and recommendations of task forces on the education of behavior disordered students and of gifted students. Task force reports address issues of philosophy, educational goals, curriculum goals, and program delivery. Recommendations for the task force on behavior disordered students include study of the needs of multihandicapped behavior disordered students, and the development of a K-12 continuum of learning outcomes for the content areas of behavior management,  emotional/social education, language and communication training, leisure skills, and daily living/survival skills outlined in the program of study for autistic students. The task force on gifted education emphasizes the cultural role of the teacher. The use of Individual Education Plans (IEP) is also discussed, and school composite profiles, which show students' levels of achievement by area, are described. The paper highlights the need for gifted students to have the optimal opportunity for intellectual growth. (CL)",

As controls, 16 normal children were matched for age and IQ to 16 Ss in the prenatal left hemisphere group. Ss completed neurological and neuropsychological evaluations, measures of somatosensory and motor function, and assessment of visuo-perceptual memory skills. Among conclusions were that Ss with left cerebral lesions demonstrated  verbal memory deficits compared with controls and Ss with right cerebral injuries; the magnitude of verbal memory deficits was greater in left cerebral lesions acquired after birth and as early as 2 months of age; and that, in general, results did not support the notion of plasticity and language sparing, suggesting that even with very early lesions of the left cerebral hemisphere there are persistent verbal memory and learning deficits.

First, Ss judged the meaningfulness of sentences with or without a concurrent task (intended to interfere with either articulatory or visual-spatial coding). Secondly, Ss remembered a list of six letters presented visually, where lists were composed of letters that were similar phonologically, graphemically, or dactylically. In contrast to hearing Ss, deaf Ss showed no effect of concurrent articulations on sentence plausibility judgments. Surprisingly, a concurrent visual imaging task slowed judgements for both groups about equally. Also, the proportion of \"phonological\" or \"visual\" errors in the letter-memory task did not correlate with the degree of  articulatory or visual inference in the sentence task for either group. The results do not indicate greater reliance on visual codes during reading by the deaf. (CL)",

Papers on the Scuola Di Rienzo on Rome and the Drayton School in Oxfordshire, England describe lower secondary schools. The Rome program was once a special school for physically handicapped pupils, and its evolution into an ordinary school is recounted. The English experience of integration policy is considered, and the Oxfordshire program is described; the program features internal arrangements designed to make the school more personal to its pupils. Success is ascribed to attitudes, relationships, resources/building, organization, and philosophy. The U.S. programs represented are LaFollette High School in Madison,  Wisconsin, and North Eugene High School, Oregon. The LaFollette program is described in terms of local public policy, financial resources, the history of desegregation, and the importance of the individualized education program (IEP). Eleven brief case studies exemplify student programing and special support. The Oregon approach focuses on integrating adolescents with handicaps into the public school system. Strategies to facilitate functional, physical, social, and societal integration are described. The final case study describes an experimental upper secondary school in Oslo, Norway. The evolution of the organizational model is recounted, and timetables for two classes are cited to illustrate modifications made in the regular curriculum. (CL)",

Both mastery learning and non-mastery learning formats of instruction were used to train the potential teachers. A systems approach to training was employed in a performance-based practical competency-based format. The mastery learning format involved instructional inputs with protocols which related to practical events, student responses to materials to generalize instructional information, in-class drill with feedback to selected students. Out of class activity, on a volunteer basis, provided additional instruction, drill on concepts, peer evaluations for competency, and peer drill of content. The results indicated that the mastery learning  activity produced higher achievement than non-mastery activity. More time was spent by the students per time value of credit awarded in mastery learning activity. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between the time spent in preparation for the mastery learning component of the course and performance on the examination. Author/CL)",

The paper traces the experimental basis of the field articulation phenomenon from early Gestalt psychologists such as Witkin through ego psychologists such as Rapaport, Kagan, and Kogan. Studies are also addressed that deal with child rearing attitudes and cognitive styles, touching upon such variables as age, social class, sex, and maternal attitudes. The final series of studies considered examine the relationship of parental child rearing  attitudes and cognitive styles in Turkey (marked by a conservative and inhibitive family structure dominated by an autocratic father).

Analysis of the correct, unanswered, and incorrect test items found six classes of errors, which were then examined for clues to the underlying psychological processes of the children's speech. The subjects were divided into three speech achievement levels for further error pattern and rule application analysis. Results indicated that the children did not apply the same rule to all morphological forms, with rule selection seemingly guided by the morphological mastery level, form-specific variables, and contextual cues of the test items.

Three methods were used to investigate the problem: application of a readability formula to the texts, several reading comprehension tests of original and altered versions of texts, and discourse analysis. The subjects were 3,600 freshmen at Haifa University attending a required English reading comprehension course. The students' native languages were generally Hebrew and Arabic, and most of them had had seven or eight years of English instruction. The readability formula and discourse analysis were applied to the  texts used, and the comprehension tests were administered as a regular part of the course. The findings emphasize the importance of context in reading comprehension by showing that difficulties are not limited to lexical items but are related to the connection between ideas in sentences and paragraphs. Improved instruction in recognition of markers of cohesion and increased focus on relationships between sentences are recommended. (MSE)",

        "description":"English language instruction, which is considered very important in Japan, is offered in 90 percent of all secondary schools and is studied by almost all students, even though it is an elective subject. English is considered a cultural and commercial link with the western world and has been taught in Japan since the mid-nineteenth century. Most college students use English as their required foreign language, and hundreds of thousands of Japanese people study English through private language schools, company courses, and radio and television instruction. Most elementary schools, which are municipally controlled, do not provide foreign language instruction, but some elementary school students learn English through private schools as early preparation for academic competition. Most  students begin English instruction in junior high school, at age twelve. Very few alternative languages are offered. Junior high and high school courses, which are rigidly controlled, provide preparation for university entrance examinations. Private high schools offer more class hours of English than do public schools. College entrance examinations often contain substantial English portions. Universities generally require two foreign languages, with English the most popular. English teacher education emphasizes traditional curricula, not teaching methodology or language proficiency.

The implementation strategies include provision for monitoring and feedback from workshop leaders, teachers, and students. Data derived from children's reading and language test performance, classroom observation, and a study of instructional problems faced by teachers in using the approach are analyzed, and recommendations are made.

        "description":"The effect of race on faculty pay, controlling for length of service and academic rank, was studied at the School of Management at a medium-sized, southwest university. The objective was to determine whether racial bias or discrimination affect faculty salaries. All of the 22 full-time faculty in the study were male and held Ph.D. degrees. Seven were nonwhite: one was Black, three were of East Indian descent, and three were of Chinese descent. Only faculty who had been at the university 3 years or more and had received at least two pay raise evaluations were assessed. All but three had the rank at the tenured associate professor level or higher. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that white faculty received on the average $462 more than nonwhite faculty in annual  salary raises, and they earned on the average $4,200 more than nonwhites. Rank accounted for a difference in salary raises of $25 per year. Persons with longer tenure received about $18 less than more recently hired persons in terms of annual salary raises. It was concluded that the process by which pay is determined appears to be biased against minority faculty. Implications for the enhancement of equal employment opportunity are discussed. A four-page list of references and several tables are appended. (SW)",

In-state expenditures by the universities and local expenditures by university staff and students were measured. A major impact was the value of business property, real estate, and inventory in Arkansas attributable to the presence of the universities. Another impact was the expansion of banks' credit base due to deposits from the universities, university staff, and students. Business volume attributable to selected Arkansas universities was estimated to be over $940 million in fiscal year 1983, or 3 percent of the state's total business volume. Local business property and inventory  committed to university-related business amounted to over $175 million, or 9 percent of the total property and inventory in the state. Money deposited by Arkansas universities and their staffs and students expanded bank credit in the state by over $85 million. Almost $21 million of local business volume was generated by campuses enterprises (e.g., bookstores and food services). The universities also created tax revenues for the state, 36,000 jobs, and $400 million in personal income. (SW)",

Five undergraduate admissions models were assessed. The single-index minimum model uses a single index, such as high school grade point average (GPA), to determine eligibility. The multiple-index minimum model uses two or more indexes. An either-or minimum model allows for eligibility if a minimum is equalled or surpassed on either of one or more indexes. Students might be eligible, for example, if in the top half of their high school class or if their Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) total score is 700 or above. A sliding scales model specifies different minimums on different indexes at different levels of high school or test performance. The fifth model  is based on predicted performance: a regression equation is developed from data on past students and is used to predict performance for applicants. In addition to data on SAT scores, the analysis was based on responses to the Student Descriptive Questionnaire. A detailed description is provided of the five admissions models, the data base employed, and the analyses performed. Nine tables show the percentage of eligible seniors using each model, including the criteria of high school rank, high school GPA, and SAT total scores. (SW)",

The women administrators indicated that interactions with students were of greater importance to their work commitment than did the men, but they assigned less importance to salary and fringe benefits than did their male colleagues. More satisfied  male administrators rated their positions as being high in autonomy, job feedback, and skill variety than did less satisfied administrators. Additional variables that were related significantly to job satisfaction for male administrators were age, the degree to which the organization was cooperative and caring, and salary. The degree of caring and support at the university was also important to women, as were skill variety and opportunities (i.e., the likelihood of finding a similar position at another university within or outside the state).

Specific references are made to the effect of the Higher Education Act on Iowa colleges, and the effect of reductions in federal aid on access and choice in postsecondary education. The act is the primary source of federal support for colleges and universities and college students. A significant aspect of the Reagan Administration proposals is the $4,000 cap for any student receiving federal aid, including loans and work-study grants. Another proposal that is considered is placing an  income ceiling of $25,000 on those who can receive the Pell Grant or campus-based aid. It is suggested that the $4,000 cap on federal aid would have a serious impact on private colleges and on high-need students attending public institutions. Additional topics include: the effect of the $4,000 ceiling on graduate and professional students, outcomes of governmental decisions to emphasize loan programs administered outside of higher education, and priorities for categorical programs that are part of the Higher Education Act.

The rehabilitation and modernization of physical facilities is another issue facing many colleges today that is addressed by the act. To illustrate the problem, a building condition audit for the  University of Illinois is included. It is argued that Illinois does not have the resources to replace federal student financial aid funds if the federal programs are reduced or fail to keep pace with increasing college costs.

Extensive statistical data are reported separately for women and men, and for 37 institutional groupings, based on the school's enrollment size, degree of selectivity, control, level, religious affiliation, and racial composition. The survey results revealed that students continue to support liberal positions on a number of key political and social issues. There is a continuing decline of freshman interest in traditional liberal arts majors, particularly the sciences. Significant increases occurred in the proportion of entering  students participating in campus-funded aid and scholarship programs, but little change in the proportion of freshmen participating in federal grant and loan programs. Included are: a brief narrative summary of the results, information on the research methodology, the 1985 Student Information Form, a specification of region categories and the coding scheme, a list of participating institutions, and a sample survey report provided to a participating institution.

The relationship of the levels and changes in FMG supply to legislative decisions of the past three decades is also addressed, with attention to post-World War II legislation, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, legislative changes in the mid-1970s, the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976, and recent legislation. The numerical impact of FMGs on specialty distribution, activity distribution, and practice location is analyzed, and information is provided on the performance of FMGs on standard qualification examinations. The activity and  specialty patterns and practice locations of U.S. citizen FMGs are also assessed. Over the 1970-1979 period, FMGs constituted about one-fifth of the annual active physician supply, but accounted for one-third of the growth in physician supply. It is estimated that the FMG supply will grow at a slower rate in the future than in the past: by about 35% between 1981 and the year 2000, with most of the growth occurring in the early years of the period as a result of the return of U.S. FMGs to the United States.

The SEOG program is a campus-based aid program that provides money to schools, which then distribute it to students. Attention was directed to the following concerns: the kinds of schools that receive SEOG funds, the family income of students receiving SEOG funds, the distribution of SEOG funds to different categories of institutions, and whether SEOG funds are going to students who receive Pell grants. The chief finding concerns the distribution of SEOG funds for dependent and independent students from different income categories. For dependent students (the larger group), the data show that in 1983-1984, the funds did not appear to be concentrated on  students from lower income categories. SEOG dollars were awarded to students in all income categories, from the highest ($25,000 or more) to the lowest ($14,999 or less). This overall pattern held for all four groups of schools examined (private, public, private historically black, and proprietary), although in varying degrees. For independent students, SEOG recipients from all four groups of schools were concentrated in the lower income categories. Technical information on the sample and research methods is included.

Five features of American secondary schooling that undergird problems of effectiveness (as measured by international academic standards and expectations of higher education) are considered: (1) the extent to which secondary education has sought and achieved universal participation; (2) the extent to which the individual school is asked to replicate the coverage of subjects and types of students found in the system at large; (3) the close tie between primary and secondary education; (4) local control, whereby elementary and secondary school principals and teachers are watched carefully by lay chiefs and parents; and (5) a monopoly  of clientele, based on geographic zoning, that typifies secondary schools. The education of secondary school teachers is also discussed in relation to the following topics: subject-matter departments of major universities, schools of education at universities, teachers' colleges located at nonuniversity institutions but which are under strong university influence, and teachers' colleges in a nonuniversity sector that have autonomy from the university. A strategy of variety is suggested that would give the secondary system greater adaptability and flexibility. (SW)",

More poor people, more minorities, and more immigrants live in cities where the college-age population is still less than half as likely to enroll in college as their suburban counterparts. The problems of urban colleges include funding, student poverty, high attrition, school system failures, and confused missions. While urban community colleges and universities  recognize the importance of the transfer student, problems in articulation remain. In assessing outcomes, consideration is given to the attainment of associate degrees, percentages of students who transfer, and the performance of transfer students. Progress in solving 10 problem areas affecting articulation is described, and policies to enhance transfer of community college students are recommended (e.g., university scholarships, joint faculty events, and counseling exchanges).

The number of special master's degree programs has grown, and many programs lead to specialized entry-level positions in the professions or to supervisory careers. Almost no American profession lacks an appropriate master's degree program. There has also been increasing provision for applied experience through internships. While residency and mentorship has been deemphasized or discontinued, no new consensus about the structure of external degrees, or external coursework, has been developed. In addition to professional  education, master's programs also provide traditional scholarly training for future university leaders, and avocational study for students whose goal is learning. Likely trends for the future include: the professionalization of the master's degree will continue; the delivery of master's programs to distant sites, especially by technological means, will probably accelerate; and the master's degree in traditional disciplines will require continuing re-examination and refinement.

Data were drawn from the 1981 Survey of 1979-80 College Graduates, which covered individuals who received bachelor's or master's degrees from July 1, 1979, to June 30, 1980. A sample of 15,852 graduates from a nationally representative sample of 286 institutions was selected. The average salary in May 1981 for full-time employed male college graduates was $17,000, compared to $13,400 for females. The salary differences between male and female graduates were analyzed using a descriptive approach, regression analysis, and the decomposition-of-means technique. It was found that men outnumbered women in the  high-paying occupation and major field categories, while women outnumbered men in the low-paying categories. While half the difference in predicted salary was attributed to women choosing lower-paying industries and occupations, the other half appears attributable to a lower rate-of-return for females compared to males on all predictor variables. Extensive appendices provide statistical findings and information on predictor variables, the survey and sampling procedures, frequency distributions and salaries categorized by occupation, major field of study, industrial grouping, marital status, region, race/ethnicity, and full-time work experience.

        "description":"The attribution patterns of 132 Japanese-American and 63 Anglo-American students at the University of Hawaii were studied in 1984. Students were administered the Mathematics Attribution Scale as well as measures of achievement motivation, anxiety, and self-esteem. Japanese-American students were found to have lower achievement motivation and higher anxiety than the Anglo-American students. Attributions for success in algebra were significantly correlated with achievement motivation for both cultural groups. For both groups, those who attributed their success to their effort tended to be higher in achievement motivation and self-esteem. Those who attributed their success to the ease of the task tended to be lower in self-esteem. In addition, for both groups, those who attributed  their failure to a poor educational environment tend to be lower in achievement motivation and self-esteem. It appears that Japanese-Americans who have higher achievement motivation also tend to attribute their success to their ability, while no such correlation was found for Anglo-Americans. Compared to Anglo-Americans, Japanese-Americans more often attributed their success in Algebra to educational environment and ease of the task, and they more often attributed failure to lack of ability and poor educational environment.

        "description":"Issues concerning the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965 are voiced by representatives from various states, based on hearings held in New York City. It is recommended that the Pell Grant Program continue to be the cornerstone program of federal financial aid to postsecondary students. A large percentage of Pell grant recipients are minorities and women. Students at the City University of New York (CUNY) receive more Pell Grant dollars per student than any other postsecondary education institution, and more Black and Hispanic seniors receive Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants than White students. CUNY's University Student Senate feels it would be unwise to increase funding for the Work Study Program at the expense of other aid programs. One-third of the  students attending California State University depend on scholarships, grants, loans, and work to attend college. Of 91,000 financial aid recipients, 45,000 depend on Pell Grants and 43,000 rely on the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Testimony from a Barnard College student addresses the proposed $8,000 ceiling on financial aid and notes that the average amount required to attend private colleges is estimated at $11,600 for 1986.

        "description":"To examine the role of elaborations in learning a procedural skill (i.e., using a personal computer) from an instructional text, 88 members of the Carnegie-Mellon University community (students, faculty, and staff members) participated in two experiments. Experimental sessions consisted of a reading period followed by a task performance period in which subjects utilized an IBM personal computer. The first experiment compared two sources of elaborations: those provided in an elaborated version of the microcomputer user's manual, and those generated by learners while reading an unelaborated manual. For the second condition, subjects were given advance information about the tasks they were to perform so that they would generate more specific, task-related elaborations while reading.  It was concluded that both sources of elaborations facilitated skill performance, in contrast to past experiments testing declarative knowledge in which author-provided elaborations were found to hurt performance. The second experiment examined responses to author-provided elaborations which were classified into two groups: those illustrating the syntax of the operation system commands and those explaining basic concepts and their applicability. Findings indicate that, although syntax elaborations produced significant facilitation for both experienced and novice computer users, concept elaborations produced no reliable improvement. Appendices contain samples of elaborations used in the two experiments, a five-page list of references, notes, and five data tables. (JB)",

A discussion of the potential of authoring systems as tools for generating electronic text-based instruction is followed by an outline of perspectives for a systematic/scientific approach to instructional product development. It is suggested that if electronic text systems are to become truly useful resources, the problem of how  to integrate the delivery of instructional products with other educational activities that are based on electronic text, must be addressed; such activities would include library data bases, electronic mail, and computer conferencing.

Rhetoricians, writing teachers, and psychologists all agree that the use of analogy and first- or second-person sentence construction make for more effective communication than the absence of analogy and the use of the impersonal third person. However, established conventions and standards sometimes preclude inserting these stylistic devices into our material. With only an intuitive feel for the use of language, our arguments lack the substantive basis with which to change the standards. In order to examine the discrepancy between theory and practice, an experiment with computer documentation was conducted to measure the effects  of analogy and second-person construction in learning, and another to assess whether these same stylistic devices were annoying to subject matter experts. The use of analogy made it easier for subjects to recall information without being cued; however, it had no effect on cued recall (recognition). Computer programmers were indifferent to the use of analogy (not hostile), and they preferred the second person sentence construction to the third person. (Author/JB)",

A total of 60 teachers--40 elementary and 20 secondary--in 25 districts and 49 schools in the state of California were interviewed. Schools varied in the number of microcomputers available for instruction (1 to 55, with an  average of about 12), and in the resources they provided for microcomputer-based instruction. Based on 16 variables of instructional characteristics underlying microcomputer-based instruction, four homogeneous clusters of teachers were identified: orchestration (N=18), enrichment (N-23), adjunct instruction (N=14), and drill and practice (N=5). Analysis of the data indicates that, although teacher attitudes toward microcomputers were not related to the patterns of microcomputer-based instruction that were identified, all teachers held uniformly positive attitudes. Teacher knowledge about microcomputers was also unrelated to the average amount of coursework taken in mathematics, but the amount of science taken as an undergraduate did reflect positively on instructional use. Recommendations  are presented for staff development and the characteristics of teacher-friendly courseware are discussed. Appendices include the interview guides and questionnaires used as well as discussions of methodological considerations and modes of microcomputer-based instruction.

        "description":"This study examined both general and specific parent-child television viewing experiences together with any interactions related to television viewing whether the child has watched television with a parent or alone. A total of 384 telephone interviews of parents (57% female, 43% male) with children at home between the ages of 6 and 18 were conducted in a major midwest market. The questionnaire elicited information on: general patterns of both individual and joint (parent-child) exposure to television; general patterns of parent-child conversations about television; specific parent-child TV-related conversations recalled from the previous evening; and relevant demographic and communication variables. Respondents reported watching television with their child an average of 4 days  per week; one in three (34%) said every day. Most (59%) said that when they watched television with their child, it was because they both wanted to watch at the same time. Parents appeared to have ambivalent feelings toward talking about TV with their child. While 79% said that it was at least somewhat important and 30% said very important, relatively few reported really enjoying such conversations. In addition, children did not appear to talk with their parents about the programs they watched alone; 53% said such discussion occurred, at most, occasionally. These findings suggest that the form and content of television may serve to minimize rather than facilitate communication among co-viewers, although the frequency, duration, and quality of conversations about television may be no  different than other non-television related conversations between parents and children. Additional survey and experimental examinations are called for to continue to collect data on television's role in the context of family relationships.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the applications which best suit the microcomputer in an educational setting with emphasis on adapting effective pedagogical practice to the computer's programability and delivery capabilities. Discovery learning and &quot;being told&quot; are identified as two types of computer assisted instruction (CAI) and sample uses of each method are compared and contrasted to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Comparison of these two CAI methods is based on analyses of five components: (1) student reinforcement; (2) full use of the potential of microcomputers; (3) student-computer interactions; (4) knowledge of possible answers and probable mistakes; and (5) existence of an interactive environment. It is pointed out that learning to program in &quot;discovery languages&quot; (LOGO,  PILOT) is a powerful skill that all students should have available to them. Implications of CAI for use with special education students are discussed, and specific benefits are suggested for behaviorally disoriented, mentally and physically handicapped, and learning disabled students. Four major components of CAI that assist these students are identified: program patience, program repetition, eagerness of students to use computers, and suitability for discovery learning. Teachers are encouraged to familiarize themselves with programs that teach effectively and to help create programs that ensure superior instruction. A three-page list of references completes the document. (JB)",

The first of two major sections presents a rationale for interactive videodisc instruction, a description of a four-level classification scheme for instructional videodisc configurations, and a discussion of the educational implications of the different levels. It is pointed out that videodisc-based courseware can be designed to work effectively in both Level 1 and Level 3 delivery systems; this dual approach to courseware development appears particularly suitable for use in  public school math and science instruction. The second section summarizes the development of a series of interactive videodiscs, &quot;Core Concepts in Math and Science,&quot; including instructional format, development and validation procedures, and observations from the field testing. It is concluded that the combination of interactive videodisc technology, selected instructional design, and mastery learning procedures provided the teacher with a flexible and powerful resource.

These activities consist of the design of the curriculum, the development of initial courses, and the beginning of the field test of those courses. Throughout the project, three specific areas of research will be addressed: the nature of the training needs common to library staff in rural public and school libraries and the demographics of this target group; a cost effective method of delivering training  of this nature to this widely distributed population; and how the resources of many types of institutions may be organized into a delivery network to effectively deliver this training. This report also includes preliminary data about the students enrolled in the field test, evaluation methods, and projected activities for the balance of Phase Two/Three. A brief overview of activities projected for the remainder of the project and a selected bibliography conclude the report. Appendices include the proposed curriculum, student registration forms (and data), student assessment forms, forms for those who do not complete courses, and the external evaluator's report for Phase Two/Three.

        "description":"This paper examines the gap between the learning potentials that computers provide and the actual impact of computer use on learning and development. It is argued that the computer's unique potential is derived in part from four basic attributes: information, symbol systems, user activities, and relations with the user. It is hypothesized that these attributes may affect four corresponding cognitions: knowledge structures, internal modes of representation, mental operations, and attitudes and perceptions. These effects may be obtained through \"low road\" learning (practice-intensive, leading to near automatic responses), or through \"high road\" learning (thinking-intensive, i.e., nonautomatic operations are mindfully employed). High road learning is seen as the more feasible and  promising means to facilitate conceptual learning with computers. The extent to which high road learning occurs depends on the learners' volitional mindfulness, which in turn is partly determined by the materials encountered and by personal, perceptual, and attitudinal factors. It is argued that the opportunity for mapping the computer's attributes on corresponding cognitions often does not take place because learners do not become mindful on their own. The partner-like relationship which the computer can establish with the students can promote mindfulness, but it is the student's choice as to how mindful they will be while interacting with the computer.

In order to deal with a manageable subsection of this complex issue, the paper concentrates on three interrelated aspects of paper preservation: the nature of the problem, the extent of the damage, and recommendations for action. An examination of the problem discusses the causes of deterioration, the validity of current scientific methods of preservation, various complicating factors, and current tools available for creating a solution. A consideration of the extent of the problem covers examining the useful life of an item, determining how many books need immediate attention, and estimating  costs involved in preservation. Recommendations for future action include microforming materials, full involvement by librarians in planning, and developing local and national plans. Appendices contain a directory of supply companies, a chronology of paper from circa 105 AD to 1981, an extensive reference list, and the author's vita. (THC)",

        "description":"Established in 1956, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) was charged to acquire and preserve books, periodicals, prints, films, recordings, and other library materials pertinent to medicine. Since the establishment of the NLM, significant effort has been devoted to carrying out preservation responsibilities. In 1983, the Library Operations (LO) senior staff included the development and implementation of a preservation program of the biomedical literature as one of four broad objectives in the LO 1984-88 strategic plan. A senior preservation planning team was appointed to analyze the state of the NLM collections, its environment, and use, and to present available options for preservation. The planning process used for this project was modeled on a self-study procedure developed  by the Office of Management Studies (OMS) of the Association for Research Libraries (ARL) and described in &quot;Preservation Planning Program: An Assisted Self-Study Manual for Libraries.&quot; This report documents the team's findings and presents a recommended plan of action for the library. Following an introduction and executive summary, the report covers: collection condition, physical facilities and environment, collection use and maintenance, present level of preservation activity at NLM, current state of preservation technology, external factors affecting NLM's preservation plan, and recommended strategies for preservation. Six appendices are included: a background paper; a list of task force members; procedures used in surveying the physical condition of the collection; indoor pollutant  measurements of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxides, and ozone; draft preservation policy; and rationale and functions of the proposed preservation section. A brief list of references completes the report. (THC)",

Designed for end users, online library catalogs require little or no formal training, and often replace an existing manual system. Data were gathered unobtrusively by monitoring all transactions from 45 terminals on 5 of the Ohio State University campus libraries. The terminals were monitored online for 3 weeks in each of the winter, spring, and autumn terms and 2 weeks of the summer term 1981, and observation data were used to define user sessions. The study characterizes user behavior in terms of types of searches done, patterns of use, time spent on searching, errors, and system problems. Preliminary  results suggest that users have much shorter sessions on online-catalog systems than on other types of retrieval systems. Patterns of use vary between campus libraries, academic quarters, and between short and long sessions. Results of the study will be applied to improving the user interface and other system features.

Introductory comments point to the potential of honors programs as one of the few opportunities for mid-career community college faculty desiring growth within a traditional institutional framework, while characterizing most existing programs as tiny, woefully underfunded, and of minimal impact on students and faculty. Next, specific reasons cited in the literature for starting honors programs are listed, and the emphasis on such words as \"quality,\"\"outstanding,\"\"superior,\" and \"scholarship\" in these definitions is highlighted. After pointing to the lack of empirical data documenting the effects of honors programs on recruitment, retention and public image, the paper  reviews efforts to maintain high admissions standards in these programs and the instructional modes available, including the course-centered program, the single-track or prescribed curriculum program, the core-oriented program, the individualized honors program, and the comprehensive program. Factors limiting the size of honors program enrollment are next addressed, followed by a summary of the rewards for faculty initiative provided by honors programs. This summary stresses that: (1) honors programs can be conducted at a minimal level at little cost; (2) because honors programs rely heavily on faculty initiative, the individual can make a difference; (3) faculty are afforded close contact with students and ideas; (4) claims regarding the benefits of honors programs are unlikely to be  challenged by research-minded administrators in the immediate future; and (5) honors programs bring community colleges back to their initial promise of educational opportunity for all.

Next, physiological psychology is explained in terms of its focus on the brain and nervous system, electrical models of brain functioning, biofeedback, and chemical models of behavior. The next section looks at the contributions of Sigmund Freud, describing his theories of id, ego, and superego; oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages; and  the oedipal and electra complexes. The work of Carl Gustav Jung is considered next, with focus on his theories of the collective unconscious and archetypes. The final sections provide an overview of gestalt psychology as championed by Dr. Fritz Perls, which examines behavior from a wholistic perspective; and behaviorism as understood from the work of Ivan Pavlov and B.

        "description":"Second in the Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families' national child care initiative, this hearing explored the entire range of issues surrounding child care in order to develop a set of specific recommendations for Congress. Appearing before the committee were representatives of corporations and voluntary agencies in Texas that have devised innovative ways to make child care more available for millions of working families and their children. The cooperative public-private solutions they have crafted include corporate development funds, city and county-supported vendor-voucher programs for family- and center-based care, resource and referral services, and after-school programs. Described are such programs as (1) child care services of the Southland Corporation and (2)  Austin Families, Inc., a nonprofit oranization formed to develop resources for working parents and their children. The hearing record also includes a publicity flyer describing The Avance (Avan-sey) Educational Programs for Parents and Children; the Texas Department of Human Resources' Parents' Guide to Registered Family Homes (Form 2916, December, 1982); the report and recommendations of the Child Care Total Involvement Team of the Lincoln National Corporation; a description of programs of Neighborhood Centers, Inc.; and a United Way of Texas report on child day care in Texas.

        "author":["Anderson, Daniel R."],
        "description":"The purpose of this review is to determine the scientific status of the proposition that viewing television in general or viewing &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in particular affects children's attentional skills, abilities, or behaviors. It has been frequently claimed that television viewing negatively affects children's attentional abilities. The most common complaint is that rapid scene changes and movements on many television programs foster short attention spans. On these grounds, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; is sometimes cited as negatively affecting attentional abilities in its young viewers because the program uses short segments and varied pacing. Research literatures in communication, education, medicine, and psychology were extensively searched. A total of 10 relevant studies were found, four of  which dealt with &quot;Sesame Street.&quot; The research indicates that television may affect attentional abilities in children. Contrary to claims by journalists and educators, the effects appear to be positive as well as negative. Viewing of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in particular is associated with an increase in desirable attentional skills and behaviors. Because relatively few studies have examined the effects of television viewing on attention and because many of the studies have methodological shortcomings, conclusions should be considered tentative.
