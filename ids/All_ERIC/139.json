        "description":"The purposes of Project Understanding were to help participants to: obtain accurate information of human survival issues relating to people, poverty, pollution, and politics; think through the implications of these issues and examine their opinions about them; change their own opinions, attitudes, and behavior; and take effective citizen action. An opinionaire was used. The findings indicate that the multi-media method of television, discussion groups, and study materials is effective in changing expressed opinions about social and political issues. Insofar as the opinionaire was an appropriate measure representative of the content and purpose of the program, the research findings demonstrate that Project Understanding accomplished its purpose to a considerable extent. The tests  on the null hypotheses designed to ascertain the representativeness of the experimental group were sustained. The hypotheses that the program series would make no difference in opinions on the various subjects covered were rejected. The fact that there was evidence of opinion change only on those items dealt with directly in the programs and not on the miscellaneous statements adds validity to the study. (Evaluation statistics are included). (NL)",

        "description":"One of a series of related inquiries, this study focused on computer aided decision making and record keeping in farm management; and on instructional variables in adult agricultural education which affect the reception of agricultural innovations. Phases 1 and 2 of this project entailed use of farm record data in preparing concise summaries and analyses of a farm business, and creation of a system to reduce the time needed by teachers in preparing records for summary and analysis. In the third phase, a least cost formulation was prepared using a linear programing model to generate economic and other predictions for given lots of feeder beef animals. During a workshop on revision of farm management analysis, vocational agriculture teachers and coordinators outlined changes to be  made. Findings of the investigation led to several conclusions: (1) agricultural innovations flow upward as well as downward; (2) similarly, the communication system that affords farmers instructional guidance must operate laterally and from below as well as from the top down; (3) most management decisions rest on some earlier decision and are preparatory to other decisions; (4) deliberate planning is needed to insure the instructional value of decision making in farm business management.

One hundred interviews of seven hours each, were held in a Northeastern metropolitan area and 500 interviews were held in one of three geographic areas, a large Northeastern metropolitan area, a state capital in the Middle West, and a rural area at least 100 miles from the nearest large city. Categories of variables included prior experience, current outlook, current roles, and mode of occupational and educational decision. The group of 100 interviewees were fairly active in educative activities, reading books and magazines, using radio and television, and half participating in adult education during the previous  year. Data gathered from the second set of interviews suggested something of the developmental process that was occurring for these young adults (maturing). Many had a more active, curious, engaged life style than the others; they had mostly grown up in an abundant home environment. Those young adults who expressed interest in adult education included both those who had participated during the last year and those who had not. It seems that no one category is sufficient to explain adult education participation by non-college-bound young adults. (EB)",

Data were gathered on socio-economic characteristics of the instructors, job satisfaction, and the importance attached by instructors to certain aspects of the instructional task. The instructors were found to be largely former teachers and to consider this job as a part-time or stop-gap occupation. They are almost evenly distributed by sex, are in the middle age range, and not overly active in community affairs. Responses to an attitude scale suggest that many instructors transfer their previous notions and experience with teaching  children and are not aware that adults differ from children in many ways. Although 38 felt they needed further training, only a few were prepared to spend more than a minimum amount of time participating in programs. A sequential series of one-day institutes could be planned with each devoted to a single content area. (The interview schedule and a bibliography are included.) (EB)",

        "description":"This paper, which deals chiefly with Black English (BE), is an attempt \"to exemplify some general principles concerning the nature of nonstandard dialects\" with the chief goal of demonstrating the legitimacy of such dialects and fostering an attitude of respect towards them. The following points are stressed: (1) BE shares many features with other varieties of English, but is distinct in having a number of pronunciation and grammatical features peculiar to itself. (2) There are intra-dialectal variations among speakers of BE which correlate with social class, age, and degree of racial isolation. (3) Although BE is spoken almost exclusively by Negroes, not all Negroes speak BE, nor do BE speakers use exclusively nonstandard forms; there is a degree of fluctuation between BE and  more standard-like forms. (4) BE is a fully formed system in its own right, with its own pronunciation and grammar rules, and is not simply an unworthy approximation of standard English. (5) The distinctiveness of BE can be traced to such factors as the influence of creole languages spoken by early plantation slaves, as well as to the social isolation of the Black community. (FWB)",

        "description":"This paper discusses some of the factors involved in deciding which variety of English to teach in areas of African where English is the language of education. Three main alternatives are recognized: American English, British English, or African English. Until recently, English was taught almost exclusively with British materials, and students were expected to approximate the British accent and to pass British examinations in English. Recent inroads have been made by American English, however, because of the availability of modern teaching and testing materials from American rather than British sources, because of the presence of American teachers in Africa, and because of increased opportunities for African students to pursue a higher education in the United States. Also  recognized is African English, here identified as the variety spoken by an emerging elite of African politicians and statesmen &quot;whose own command of English is both internationally intelligible and yet at the same time identifiably African,&quot; and the author discusses possibilities for preparing materials for teaching this variety once it has been described in modern linguistic and phonetic terms. The effects of choosing one variety over the other are considered in terms of the differences among them, as well as in terms of social and cultural consequences. (FWB)",

        "author":["Hays, Harriet Nutt"],
        "description":"This paper reports the initial phase of a series of experiments conducted on a large number of videotapes made for the purpose of analyzing public-school classroom interaction. The experiments originally aimed to preduct the most reliable, efficient and economic way of producing transcriptions which are sufficiently representative of the verbal events used for empirical research. Results tabulated thus far indicate that, particularly among nonlinguists, but also among linguists, transcriptions of the same event into standard orthography are apt to differ to a significant extent; that some of these differences may not be entirely predictable; and that it takes at least two iterations of post-editing of the transcript to get a reasonable orthographic representation of the event. It  also appears that the more complicated the structures involved, whether they be social, semantic or grammatical, the more verifications or post-editings are needed to produce an accurate transcription. The optimum work increment, processor personality, training or sequencing is not yet determinable, but, especially for difficult passages, it is likely that pairs of judges in the final editings, working together with transcript and tape, will be more efficient than single judges left alone with their idiosyncratic prejudices, anticipations, hearing and experience.

        "description":"The present paper reviews recent research in the area of nonstandard English: the major results to date, the significance of this research for education, and suggestions for further research. The notion of \"standard\" English resists precise definition; there is not a simple set of linguistic features which can be said to define it. The term \"nonstandard\" English also lacks a precise definition. There is, however, some intuitive notion about the range of speech habits which identify a speaker of standard English. (George Wallace, Richard Nixon, and H. L. Hunt may be considered speakers of standard English, while Cesar Chavez, Eldridge Cleaver, and Nguyen Cao Ky speak nonstandard dialects, and in some cases, perhaps the standard English dialect as well.) A dialect may be classified  from at least four points of view, according to (1) whether the speaker learned English as his first language, or second or third; (2) the region of the U.S. where the language was learned; (3) the cultural composition of the speech community; and (4) the socio-economic status (SES) of the speech community. A dialect may reflect all of these classifying labels. The effect of SES on a speaker's dialect is not absolute presence or absence of certain linguistic features but rather the relative frequency of these features. Speech style is distinguished from social dialect. (AMM)",

The author finds that whereas sociolinguists tend to ignore such factors as social change and social mobility, anthropologists such as F. Barth (\"Models of Social Behavior,\" 1966) express the concept of an ongoing process of change in social structure, stressing that social structure is subject to modification and that individual human values affect social institutions and are in turn affected by them. The author feels that this model of social structure, although not applied to language by Barth himself, is relevant to sociolinguistics because: (1) language expresses social values and hence any changes in the one must be  reflected in the other; (2) language itself provides an interesting parallel to social structure in its own development and modification. The author feels that the linguist should be able to pin-point the development of a language as a result of individual choices, and that the sociolinguist should try to relate changes in social structure to changes in individual cultural values as espressed through speech in social interaction. Individual behavior is thus seen as the proper starting point for sociolinguistic investigation. Suggested applications of the model are presented. (FWB)",

In the present study, a direct continuation of earlier ones, modifications in design, teaching strategies, etc., were made in order to increase the probability of detecting true differences between methods, if such existed. Three methods were compared: the Implicit method, the Explicit-English method(Ee), and the Explicit-Swedish method(Es). All three have systematized drills, but Ee and Es feature analysis and explanations as well; in Ee such explanations are given in English, in Es in Swedish. The present study differed from earlier ones in several ways:  a new type of explanation was used, the duration of the experiment was prolonged, and the grammatical content was more varied. Main effects were investigated by analysis of covariance and interaction effects by analysis of variance. Individual scores were used as units of analysis, and various measures of progress during the experiment were used in the comparisons. Results agreed with earlier findings that the three different methods do not generate any differences in learning effects. See related document ED 034 172.

        "description":"This study of linguistic change is done within the \"dynamic paradigm\" of linguistic description, in which the strict dichotomy between diachronic and synchronic linguistics found in \"static paradigms\" is not maintained. The chief purpose here is to indicate how rate could be built into a linguistic description of sound change, such change being here considered as \"represented in the wave-like spread of a given rule as it is borrowed from speaker to speaker.\" Two principal alterations to which a rule is subject in the process of spreading are considered: (1) it may become more general, i.e., simpler, increased generality resulting from the loss of environmental specifications for the operations of the rule; the fact that the rule operates in one environment earlier than in others  can be viewed as a difference in the relative rate of the rule with respect to the different environments: 2) reweighting, where changes in the weight of features (in terms of markedness) influence rate of change. The first part of this paper presents the principles on which the study is based, formalizes the notion of rate, and presents evidence for reweighting. The second part considers linguistic and sociolinguistic algorithms for sound change. The final section deals briefly with the effects of overlapping waves of change from different origins.

These compositions are examined in the light of certain established facts about Black English (both phonological and grammatical) to ascertain the extent to which dialect interference can be used to explain certain phenomena found in the students' writing. The authors conclude that dialect interference does indeed play a role in the writing of Black English speakers and discuss the implications of this conclusion for the composition teacher. (FWB)",

In the lead article, Evelyn Hatch surveys some of the research in first language acquisition and points out its implications for second language teaching. Her main thesis is that with the best of intentions, teachers often insist that children in English-as-a-second-language classes achieve a mastery of certain structures that is beyond the mastery achieved by &quot;advantaged&quot; middle class children who speak English natively. Following her article, she reviews three new books on child language. Bilingualism is the subject of most of the items included in &quot;Information Exchange,&quot; which describes important surveys of the field, discusses the need for bilingual  programs and presents a definition of their structure, and reports on individual programs for American Indian children. A special section of &quot;Information Exchange&quot; deals with the American Indian languages themselves, with maps, lists of the most widely spoken Indian languages and Summer Institute of Linguistics linguists working on them, and a brief report of a study of social factors involved in Shoshoni dialect variation. Two sets of materials are worked on: the CITE materials for Navajo children, and the Michigan Migrant Workers Council materials for Spanish-speaking children. (AMM)",

This paper examines the conclusions reached by other scholars that BE's affinities are more with Creole languages than with SE, and considers the copula in several Creoles (West African Pidgin, Gullah, and Haitian Creole) in order to determine the extent to which copula absence can be taken as evidence of the Creole nature of BE. The author finds evidence to support both sides of the argument, nor does he find the two positions incompatible. He concludes, however, after an  examination of Hebrew, a copula-less language unrelated to the other languages in question, that the copula positions examined by Labov (past tense, clause final, and following a verb or auxiliary) \"have some sort of inter-language importance to copulas in that funny things happen in these positions,\" and sees this fact as limiting the extent to which comparative studies of the copula in Creole languages can support or weaken either side of the argument.

In \"Frontiers of Linguistic Theory\" Morris Halle uses a discussion of the placement of  stress in English words as the basis for certain speculations about the role of innate capacities in the child's acquisition of language. Finally, William Labov's paper \"The Place of Linguistic Research in American Society\" emphasizes the theme \"that the most important applications of linguistic method in education do not lie in the area of grammatical research but rather in the formal study of verbal interaction and the value systems inherent in this behavior\" and therefore urges that linguistics deal more with everyday speech.

After a discussion of the societal context for the participation of youth, the history of youth involvement, and various youth involvement models employed in the past it is concluded that with the exception of the development  of techniques for involving delinquents in helping other delinquents very little has been learned about involving youth in decision making and program implementation.

Thirty boys who had just completed the sixth grade were subjects for the study. One group of fifteen boys received art counseling; the other group of fifteen boys received only traditional non-directive counseling. The art counseling group was unaware of the goals of art counseling and viewed each session as an art class they had elected. The treatment took place over a daily eight weeks summer session.

A total of 22 items were constructed consisting of the four behavior factors, the test was standardized, and is now being used successfully to identify potential male underachievers. The second paper discusses a change in the role of the counselor, mainly that the teachers be given in-service training to learn the approaches of the counselor and then deal with the emotional aspects of learning using these techniques.

From impressions gained from nationwide interviews, the vast majority of students are anxious for solutions to the problems of student climate, and they represent a tremendous resource, to date largely untapped. The following suggestions are made on the recognition that students have a legitimate gripe, and that the situation is not hopeless. Some fundamental changes must take place, however, and there are resources to cope with what is going on. Firstly, there is a need for a student information system, with up to date, usable student information for making decisions. The school district organization should have a unit that has student development and student life as its primary concern. Secondly, there is a need for a  student development focus to build better human relations. A student center, concerned with student life should be set up in each school. Teachers with good rapport should be able to interact with students, and provisions need to be made for this. The student body should be allowed to take more responsibility for supervision than is presently allowed. (Author/KJ)",

Conclusions suggest that counseling success varies as a function of counselor comfort, and that counselors tend to become more comfortable with experience. Consequently, experienced counselors tend to be more effective to the extent that their experience is accompanied by perceived comfort with their involvement in a particular counseling context. The second paper presents a study designed to investigate awareness of the Counseling Center, as perceived by University of Utah students. It was found that about one quarter of the student sample were totally unfamiliar with the Center, and that whether students had been to and/or  heard of the Center was related to their perception of the Center's service function. Study results strongly point to the need for greater student awareness of the Center's function. (Author/KJ)",

Since prevention is receiving increasing emphasis, psychologists need thorough training in the developmental psychology of both infancy and early childhood. Secondly, the training of paraprofessionals is of great current interest, and perhaps graduate students could be utilized effectively in this role. Thirdly, with the increased use of consultants comes the concern that consultants will be inadequately trained in the area about which they are consulting, and over trained in the art of consulting. Fourthly, research and its place needs a reorientation. Child psychology should stop emphasizing the application of knowledge at the expense of generating knowledge, and an attitude of  scientific skepticism should be developed. Lastly, there seems to be a growing impatience among students to deal with the \"real problems\" of the world. The didactic work seems tedious, the theorizing irrelevant, and the learning of techniques intolerable. While there is merit to some of these points, some of these aspects of training are necessary for professional competency. (Author/KJ)",

Aid must also come from state governments and private sources. The colleges and universities will have to put forth a united and joint effort also. Cooperative planned programs are a must if those in higher education are to do the job the public expects of them. Since there is no lobby, the educators in this field must become a powerful and potent lobby, publicizing the needs of the profession, and meeting the demands of the medical profession, of the students, and of society.

The purposes of phase two were: (1) to determine whether students carried out their declared plans; and (2) to analyze factors which caused them to change their plans. A questionnaire was developed for these purposes. Generally, it was found that students did follow through. When  changes occurred money was the most significant factor.

The panel shared their ideas of issues such as the goals of group counseling, various approaches and perspectives, the role of the counselor in the group, counselor self-disclosure, the screening of counselees, communication with parents and teachers, and training for group counselors. Questions dealt with subjects such as the effectiveness and advantages of  group counseling, composition of groups, screening of members, goal setting, various techniques, remedial vs. developmental functions of the counselor, counselor specialization and measurement of counseling effectiveness. No guidelines were established and no specific points were agreed upon by group members, but many ideas and perspectives were expressed. (RSM)",

He presents an innovative training program designed to help counselor trainees better understand the problems of contemporary society and discusses the relevance of the rapid rate of societal change to counselors. The next article by James Thorp is concerned with the legal implications of House Bill 338 for school counselors. This bill requires that teachers and school authorities report evidence of child abuse to the proper officials. An address by  Dr. Paul Fitzgerald stresses that the passport for counselors through the seventies must be involvement and that counselors must be instruments for change. Betram Gardner discusses the black student and emphasizes that \"white counseling\" techniques along with counselor attitudes are detrimental to the black child. Needed improvements in counseling and counselor attitudes are presented. The report also includes brief presentations by other individuals. (RSM)",

The program encompasses 28 different clinics and facilities. Factors hindering or influencing the final pattern of health care delivery include: (1) federal funding agencies' guidelines and biases; (2) grossly underestimated health care demands by an unlimited population load; (3) differences among family members for facility, hours of service, and health care provider; and (4) difficulties in the recruitment of scarce health professionals. After experimenting with many different patterns of team care and leadership, a workable model emerged using the combination of a  neighborhood aide and a backup social worker as the basic core for family-centered health care. The social worker is responsible for forming a flexible \"Health Team\" to meet the needs of a particular family. A central social service register, decentralization of personnel, and constant administrative support are essential. (Author)",

Subjects (162) were assigned to the nine lists and to short-versus long-term (48 hour) retention intervals.

Twenty-eight specific variables are examined. Findings indicated that only three of the 28 variables significantly influenced counselor functioning time-wise: (1) whether the counselor was trained primarily in Maryland; (2) the size of the county by secondary school enrollment; and (3) the number of guidance supervisors per  county.

For the first study on retention of probability concepts, the correlation between achievement scores immediately after learning and those obtained four weeks later was .78. Retention ratios were calculated for individuals (.60 to 1.05) for total test (.96), for each objective (.43 to 1.09), and for each item (.43 to 1.10). For the second study on recall of  mathematical proofs the correlation between achievement scores immediately after learning and those obtained two weeks later was .75.

Following this, several paradigms for further research were suggested. One research paradigm dealt with individual differences and memory attributes. It was suggested that individuals may differ in the extent to which they develop or utilize certain types of attributes. A second research paradigm dealt with the types of organization imposed by a subject during the learning of a list of verbal items. Finally, some selected research on second-order storage and retrieval plans was reviewed. Implications of research on memory attributes for education were discussed. (Author)",

One involves a factor analysis of the sociometric matrix and the other two are different approaches to the weighting of sociometric choices. All turn out to have the same mathematical solution when the relationships are symmetric; it is certain eigenvectors of the sociometric matrix. This technique has the additional benefit of giving the clique structure at a glance. The technique is compared to Hubbell's (1965) method for clique identification. The method is then illustratively applied to structural data on the pattern of overlap in membership among a set of high school activities. A measure of \"centrality\" in this structure, analogous to individual popularity in sociometric  structures, is calculated for each of the activities and the results are compared to common sense expectations about high school activities.

The subjects were 642 students in grades 8-11. The data was derived from the year-end marks that each student received in the subject areas, upon which the decision to promote or retain was made. Two sets of data were collected for each subject area, Yr. I and Yr. II, and these were compared for differences. The results indicated that while repeating students did show significant improvement in some subject areas (Yr. I: Yr. II: p.<.01) this was not true of all subject areas. Further, even in cases of significant improvement the gain was hardly sufficient to justify a whole years extra work. Students repeating a whole grade and  thus retaking in some cases subject matter that they had successfully completed once, showed a marked drop in performance. It was concluded that non-promotion could not be justified on the grounds that it would result in a meaningful improvement in performance as this is reflected in scholastic evaluative procedures.

Methods for thinking about alternative educational futures are presented with the underlying assumptions that education is not an isolated set of phenomenon, independent of other sectors of society; consequently planning must be done in conjunction with speculation about changes in the technological and societal environment which might effect education. Part II reviews the plans of American Education for the future. Five models have been developed to synthesize the  major ways of viewing the future: (1) the future as the present; (2) the future as an extrapolation of the present; (3) the single alternative future; (4) the technological future; and (5) the comprehensive future.

Aggressive amd submissive client \"stimuli\" were the focus of study. Two members of a college drama group, trained in the role of a submissive and an aggressive client, respectively, were interviewed by 31 counselors, who had been requested to conduct intake or \"disposition\" interviews with these \"students on the college counseling center waiting list.\" The half-hour tape-recorded interviews were analyzed for counselors' verbal behavior using a revision of Bales' (1950) Interaction Process Analysis system, developed by Gamsky (1965). Analysis of the data indicated that counselors do emit significantly different verbal bahavior, as  well as to such behavior aimed at themselves rather than toward others. Submissive individuals elicit \"comforting\" reactions and reflections of their feelings significantly more than do aggressive individuals. The latter tend to evoke more passivity, more avoidance, and more active interpretive responses from counselors.

This study is intended as a benchmark approach against which the rate of progress of the Alaska Native might be measured and evaluated as he is involved in the development of Alaska. Discussed are: (1) rising trends in population; (2) change in living patterns from nomadic to sedentary; (3) uneven economic patterns; (4) cultural and educational attitudes; and (5) land uses and potentialities. It is anticipated that this study will provide a basis for further work and that the material will be available for comparison with information from the  1970 census. (Author/CJ)",

The program utilized the distribution of free condoms through local commercial outlets (barber shops, grocery stores, pool hall, restaurant). The proprietors agreed to distribute condoms in the target area which included approximately 3,000 males aged 12-26 years old. In a 13 week feasibility test, over 18,000 condoms were distributed. Results indicated that the number using a condom with their last coitus increased markedly. Conclusions drawn included: (1) that the condom is an acceptable contraceptive, especially for adolescent males; (2) that inner-city adolescent men do wish to prevent unwanted births; and (3) that commercial outlets are effective free distribution centers.

Volume two, an analysis of the data about students' self reports regarding involvement with marihuana, indicates that &quot;users&quot; view the teenage drug scene very differently from &quot;non-users&quot;. This is elaborated upon. In the third volume, data was used for developing a procedure for comparing climate for drugs among different groups of  teenagers living in different neighborhoods and attending different schools. A survey given to teachers indicated that they feel that the school, the home, public health agencies and other social institutions should share the responsibility for drug education, and are committed to a school program of instruction as a major response to the problem.

Data were collected from students, faculty, and administrators in 45 high schools in New Jersey. Instruments were the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire, a Pupil Attitude Questionnaire, and demographic student and school data. From study results, a prototypic high school with a high degree of alienation might be sketched as a school characterized by the  following: a more custodial pupil control orientation, a more \"closed\" organizational climate, a lower percentage of minority students, higher equalized valuation per students, larger and non-urban. More research is necessary to explore the relationship between student alienation and more organizational variables. (Author/CJ)",

The thesis of this paper is that their success depends more on the value orientations that differentiate the two groups than upon those held in common. Data were obtained from a survey of 2200 pupils enrolled in grades six, nine, and twelve in 23 racially-mixed Los Angeles schools. Comparison of Japanese-American and Anglo samples on value orientation variables support the hypothesis that the comparatively high achievement of Japanese-Americans is related more to traditional Japanese cultural values than to acquired American values. While the two groups are similar in appreciation of the value of education and the importance of peers, the  Japanese-Americans are more expressive toward school, have less belief in individual action, and have higher occupational aspirations. Japanese-Americans appear to be less acculturated to the values of the American middle class than generally believed, and explanations which rely on theories of acculturation do not adequately account for their success in American society.

In contrast, National Assessment evaluates educational changes within the larger population, its purpose being to provide more adequate information about educational quality on a regional and a national basis. Based on a model of statistical sampling similar to public opinion polls, this program describes the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and understandings of groups of persons at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and young adults. National Assessment measures \"population knowledge,\" rather than the  knowledge of an individual. Results for science and citizenship show two trends: (1) knowledge of students increases with age, and (2) adults tend to forget much of what they learned in school. (Author/LLR)",

A financial saving is the obvious advantage of combining schools with housing, commercial space (retail or office), or community services and offices. In addition, joint occupancy creates new kinds of urban environments that blend schools with communities composed of people of varied ethnic groups and income levels. This document illustrates graphically 10 schools utilizing joint occupancy; some schools are already in use, others are still in the planning stage. (Photographs may reproduce poorly.) (Author/MLF)",

All these data should be collected annually for each student in the system.

The costs and benefits of higher education were estimated on a per student or per graduate basis, and were analyzed relative to both the individual and the State. Results indicate that the first alternative is cheaper but fails to encourage low income individuals to enroll in the system. A comparison of the effects of the alternatives on the State economy seems to indicate that (1) expected costs would be greater than the benefits, and (2) State tax revenues would not be significantly affected.

The three major recommendations were (1) to reduce disparities between working conditions and costs by establishing minimum standards for several educational parameters and by allocating resources accordingly, (2) to allow no construction projects to begin until all financing arrangements have been completed, and (3) to strengthen national coordination  between project planning and resource allocation.

The choice of this plan resulted from the examination of research and literature on different forms and uses of the four-quarter plan. It was concluded that the plan would be feasible if the following conditions were met: (1) curriculum revision must accompany the move to the proposed plan; (2) content within each discipline in the program of instruction must be reevaluated; (3) business and industry, as well as teaching and operational staffs of the school district, should support the plan; and (4) the program must be adequately financed. Three surveys were conducted to assess the attitudes of the community, the business and industrial representatives, and  the certified staff to the plan. The surveys show that (1) the business and industrial community was evenly divided in approval or rejection, while (2) teachers were divided 39% in favor, 35% opposed, and 26% undecided.

The effectiveness of the laboratory experience was assessed by (1) a staff questionnaire that measured change in anticipated behavior on several dimensions, (2) a student questionnaire that assessed changes in the students' perception of school norms, and (3) various other outcome criteria such as observations from regular consultation visits to the new school and the  turnover rate in staff after the first year. These measures indicate that there were significant and desirable changes, both over time and in comparison to similar measures obtained from a control school, and that the changes could be attributed in part to the training interventions.

Some relationships between role choice and selected situational variables are also examined. The study findings conclude that (1) the Gross theory provides a useful framework for examining internal and external environmental factors, (2) the administrator role in negotiations will increasingly identify with board expectations as older and more experienced incumbents retire or seek other responsibilities, and (3) role ambivalence characterizes study subjects. In essence, role performance is consistent with an emerging &quot;managerial&quot; concept of  school administration, but role preference is identified with the more traditionally oriented &quot;instructional leader&quot; image of the administrator.

In a Head Start community a setting was created to study and service preschool children with emotional and social disturbances from low income homes. During the 3-year project, 112 children were seen, families interviewed, referrals made, special programs developed, and follow-ups initiated. Attention was especially paid to the language used to describe disturbed behavior, the use of alternatives as educational-treatment devices to involve parents and community, the roles of professionals and other workers, and the use of behavioral variation as a conceptual vehicle for facilitating understanding of disturbance. Evidence was presented to support the argument  that disturbance has to be studied in particular settings (either created or chosen), and that the findings will be a function of that setting. It is emphasized that, because lower income settings are particularly foreign to middle class researchers, they are very susceptible to bias, and that only after setting specific connections have been made and understood can generalization be possible. One is warned to be wary of generalizing a problem when it is simply a manifestation of a particular setting. (Author/KW)",

In order to identify the handicapped, questions were added to the questionnaire of the regular labor force sample survey; social workers (specialists in vocational rehabilitation) interviewed those identified by the questionnaire; and two teams composed of a physician and a vocational rehabilitation expert assessed the vocational rehabilitation prospects of the interviewees. From the sample it was estimated that approximately 2.9% of the total population in  Israel are vocationally handicapped and that roughly 39.1% of them have reasonable prospects for rehabilitation. A major portion of the document is devoted to the characteristics of the vocationally handicapped, covering demographic, physical, social, and vocational characteristics.

The three parameters studied were existential quantification, superordinate set identification, and extraneous information. Eight problem conditions were created, reflecting systematic inclusion or exclusion of each parameter. Six single-step addition problems (addends less than ten) were composed for each of the conditions. Presence of a distractor (extraneous information) was significant (p less than .01). Higher IQ EMH children significantly outperformed lower IQ EMH children on the tasks (p less than .01), but failed to demonstrate expected performance  on problems with extraneous information. The findings were felt to suggest a rote computation habit, rather than active processing of verbal information, as the problem solving style of many EMR children at all IQ levels. The need for carefully developed programs in verbal problem solving was indicated. (Author)",

Presented is a formula whereby a Pearson product-moment correlation can be corrected for restrictions in range in situations where the basis of selection is unmeasured, but where the extent of restriction for each of the two measures being correlated is known, and where the variables are assumed to be normally distributed in the population. Three examples of the use of the formula are given: in a case where a comparison is to be made between a value derived from an unrestricted sample and one derived from a restricted sample; a case when a correlation is obtained on a special restricted sample and must  be generalized to the population; and in estimating the validity of a test, where the criterion and the test scores are available on the same individuals only in a restricted sample where the basis of the selection is not clear or not measured.

Subjects receiving strategy-oriented training learned to test out associates against nouns that were part of an abstraction set to determine appropriate abstractions. Subjects receiving paired associate training memorized nouns along with associates that would serve as abstractions when nouns appeared as part of abstraction sets. Results showed that strategy-oriented training facilitated performance on transfer items and training items, while paired associate training improved training items only. The results of the strategy training  program are discussed in light of other evidence supporting the efficacy of training retardates in mental processes which are appropriate for specific conceptual tasks.

        "description":"The purpose of the study was to apply various quantitative and qualitative indices of grammatical complexity proposed by Hunt (1965) to written language samples of hearing impaired students. Hunt studied grammatical structures of normal students at three grade levels, and found that the minimal terminal syntactic unit, or T-Unit, more reliably measured increasing syntactic complexity than the Subordination Ratio commonly used. Part I of the investigation studied the T-Unit as a measure of syntactic complexity in the written language of 23 males and 23 females at nine selected age levels (10-18 years). The Subordination Ratio appeared to be more useful and reliable than the T-Unit, which, however, did prove to be a useful measure. Part II of the study examined the types of  grammatical structures which were chief contributors to increasing syntactic complexity in the written language samples. It was found that certain types of verbs and verbals possessed a great deal of sensitivity to growth across the whole 9-year age span sampled, while other constructions tended to be sensitive only at the younger or only at the older ages.

Subjects were tested yearly from 1963 to 1967 on speechreading, fingerspelling, speech intelligibility, reading achievement, arithmetic achievement, and written language. Both males and females and the combined group showed significant improvement in all areas except speech intelligibility, speechreading, and vocabulary usage. Females were consistently superior in receptive communication ability, reading achievement, and most language ability measures. No differences between the sexes were found any year in arithmetic ability or in educational achievement in the last 2 years of the study. For both sexes, growth in educational  achievement ranged from one-third grade per year in reading and language to one-half grade per year in arithmetic. In 1963, the average subject showed a battery median of four grades lower than the average non-deaf student. In 1967, battery medians were nearly 6 grades below the Stanford Achievement Test norms.

The 73 sets were converted into vocabulary tests which were randomly administered, two per child, to 13,207 deaf students, ages 7-17 years, in 89 schools for the deaf in the United States. Results indicated that girls, in general, seem to know more words than do boys, and that older children seem to know more words in common than do younger ones. The major portion of the report consists of a list of the 7,300 words, with definitions, and with the percentages of children in each of five age groups who knew the word.

Creativity was explored by examing the factors of ideational fluency, spontaneous flexibility, originality, and elaboration. Risk-taking, studied in a classroom testing situation, was regarded as academic in nature. The relationship between the two traits was studied in terms of magnitude, direction, and differences between boys and girls. The two standardized tests employed were the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, Figural, Form A and the SRA Tests of General Ability (TOGA). The Wide Range Vocabulary Test by Atwell and Wells was modified to measure academic risk-taking. Analyses of variance showed no significant  relationship between academic risk-taking and sex or general mental ability, and none between creative thinking ability and risk-taking among the boys, the girls, or the total sample. Results were similar for each of the creativity factors studied as well as for the total creativity score. It was concluded that students who guess and take chances are not necessarily more creative than students who do not. (Author/KW)",

The pre- and re-test answer sheets were scored at the school's computer center, with printouts of the resulting data being sent to the teachers. The results of the project were that, with the single exception of the sixth grade reading scores, children achieved well above what was expected on all measures at all levels. Most gains were three to four months above expected. Changes in IQ scores were also very encouraging. The sixth grade city-wide average score on the Lorge-Thorndike IQ test was  100.1 in May 1970, the first time in many years that an entire grade level of St. Louis has equalled the national average on paper-and-pencil IQ test.

CBS followed this with other educational projects. In 1952, the Board of Regents in New York State developed a plan for ETV to include 10 ultra-high-frequency (UHF) channels, but the plan was not approved by the governor. In 1955, the Commissioner of Education appointed a Temporary Study Committee on Educational Television, whose recommendations resulted in some State aid and some increased activity in television. This State-supported  experimentation lasted three years--1958-59 to 1961-62. The program of support for ETV stations began in 1961-62, after the State law had been amended to permit aid to councils on a matching fund basis. In 1965, the legislature appropriated funds to develop a statewide ETV microwave network, and to produce university-oriented TV programs and courses. By 1968, six stations were in operation. Further advances are anticipated in the use of educational television in New York State. (MF)",

The effects of the procedure were assessed in terms of (1) performance on hourly exams, (2) degree of participation in the program, and (3) student attitude toward programed study. The project involved (1) the refinement of programed study technique, and (2) the testing  of the procedure's range of usefulness. The results of the investigation indicated that the programed-study procedure produced significantly better performance in all courses taught within the Department of Psychology and in about a third of the non-psychology courses. Student attitude was generally favorable toward the programed-study procedures. The appendices include the questionnaire used in assessing student opinion and an outline of the development of a programed course. (Author/MF)",

Yet many museums in Continental Europe, in Great Britain and the British Commonwealth, and in the Americas do provide for children in a variety of ways. How museums of different types, including Children's Museums, provide for children is the subject of three reports from these different geographical areas. Class visits and leisure-time visits by children, schemes for loaning collections to schools and youth organizations, and facilities for handicapped children are topics discussed. The use and misuse of labels, models, films, lectures, publications, and questionnaires as educational aids are presented. The location, physical  characteristics, organization, sponsorship, personnel, and contents of museums in the Americas are noted. The observation is made that where Children's Museums are most successful they are least like museums and most like Youth Clubs. It is also observed that, not only are most existing museums unsuitable for children, they are also unsuitable for adults--and for the same reasons. A list of museums conducting children's work and a bibliography are given. (MF)",

        "description":"In this project, television cameras, monitors, and videotapes were used as direct teaching tools by classroom teachers, with a moderate degree of success, as judged by student achievement and acceptance. Six classroom teachers worked with 309 secondary students and 23 adults, each teacher adapting the techniques of television production to his subject area. Both teachers and students operated the equipment, televising activities in the classroom setting and out of it. An opinion sampling instrument developed for the project was administered, and revealed that: (1) students did not express a high level of confidence that, because of television, a class had taught them \"very much\"; (2) opinions about the use of television were colored by the way it was used in a particular subject  area; (3) correlation was at a significant level among those items relating to dullness or interest, amount learned, and desire to have television used in classes. The experience of the project resulted in the conclusion that all five of the television capabilities utilized--image multiplication, image magnification, image association, image transportation, and image memory--were possible using relatively inexpensive, easily operated equipment. Recommendations centered about the need for paraprofessional aides and mobile units. (MF)",

In a contingent experimentation procedure, the content of successive experimental trials is a function of a subject's responses to a previous trial or trials (in contrast to traditional experimentation in which the subject is presented a previously established sequence of trials that is constant for all subjects.) Computer control of the sequencing of stimuli on the basis of the subject's responses permits the adaptation of stimulus presentations to the response history of the learner, facilitating the optimization of learning outcomes. The manner in which contingent research designs enable the researcher to examine learning problems that are analogous to the problems of instructional  technology is demonstrated, with particular emphasis placed on the implications of contingent research techniques for task management, psychological measurement, and research design. A systematic analysis of contingent decision algorithms and on-line programs is presented, and the application of these programs is examined and compared with non-contingent research designs with respect to procedure, data collection, and efficiency.

The independent variables were: sequence (scrambled vs. logical), grade, sequence length, criterion test complexity, sex, IQ, mathematics achievement, and reading comprehension. The dependent variables were: time in acquisition, errors in acquisition, immediate posttest scores, and retention test scores. The objective of the program was to teach how to compute line slopes, and the learning task was empirically shown to be linear. Multi-factor analyses of variance were performed on numerous combinations of variables. Grade level, mathematics achievement, and test complexity did not interact with sequence, but reading, sex, IQ, and sequence  length did. Differences were observed in errors and time in acquisition, but not in performance on the criterion tests. The competence tests used are discussed in the appendix. References are given.

An analysis of such systems, however, reveals that most are limited to test-scoring and reporting functions and might best be considered instructional monitoring systems. State-of-the-art computer and educational technology is sufficiently advanced to permit development and implementation of such systems. However, true instructional management systems cannot become a reality until strategies of development and evaluation of instructional decision rules are more advanced. Prior to the development of either type of system, the specific components requiring computer support must be identified, the potential cost benefits of such support must be analyzed, and appropriate  hardware/software configurations must be established.

In particular, a linear programing model is proposed which, unlike dynamic or control theory models, allows the computer to react to the responses of a learner in seconds or less. To satisfy the assumptions of linearity, the seemingly complicated non-linear teaching-learning process is converted into a neat linear form. A theorem is proposed and proven which provides the theoretical basis for treating the teaching-learning process as a piece-wise linear form. By taking probability of success as a negative cost coefficient, a mathematical programing model is proposed for the local optimizations which lead to the global optimization when the theorem is applied. Through this Stage  Increment Model, sound and scientific optimization of the teaching-learning process for the individual becomes a reality. (Author/MF)",

Subjects in the experiment were selected from grades 6, 8, and 11; they were divided into nine cells of six subjects each. Four types of films were selected for the stimulus material and were shown as one nineteen-minute film. An analysis of where the subjects looked, called the density analysis, showed that subjects looked at a few well-defined areas of the screen. Results from the density analysis are suggestive for producers of educational films and  telelessons, as various scene variables are influential on where the subjects look.

Results point out statistical and semantic inadequacies in previous theory, and new criteria for root analysis are proposed. Application of the new theory based on synchrony and structure obtains a reduction of the residual group of root types derived from the sample to less than one percent.

Phase one involved an MLAT-trained experimental group and an untrained control group. Phase two involved a Pimsleur-trained experimental group, a control group that received cultural enrichment, and a group that was involved in the acquisition of study skills.

        "description":"Across the centuries the heroes in dramatic works develop and play out action along the same lines, although the dramas may have been created by different authors and may reflect various eras and cultures. A case in point is a comparison of the two Spanish plays &quot;El Caballero de Illescas&quot; by Lope de Vega (1602) and &quot;Los Intereses Creados&quot; by Jacinto Benavente (1907). Similarities in the fate of the two protagonists are striking. Both men arrive penniless in Naples at a bleak period of their lives anxious to improve their fortunes. Both heroes fall in love with wealthy maidens of the nobility with whom they eventually elope. The family backgrounds and origins of family fortunes have parallel details. Readers soon learn that the protagonists also had similar backgrounds. The  techniques employed constitute the major difference between the two works. Lope de Vega tells all about his hero in Act 1; the action and the similarities to Benavente do not begin until Act 2. In Benavente's work, action begins immediately and the reader learns about the protagonist in the narrative. Benavente's portrayal of his hero's split personality is the best feature of his composition, while Lope da Vega's monologues are well executed. The similarities and distinctions are shown not to cite plagiarism but analyze the two dramas more extensively and to illustrate seventeenth century and twentieth century points of view. (DS)",

The poem, &quot;Tras de amoroso lance&quot;, deals with the theme of the search of the beloved (i.e., the soul) for the lover, and incorporates the mystical concept which differentiates between erotic and divine love. Although the poems are love poems and as such are passionate and delicate, they are allegories of the mystical ascent of the soul to the state of union with God. Falconry (&quot;caza cetrera&quot;) symbolizes this search and a finding of divine love. The poet employs reiteration, alliteration, and hendecasyllables frequently in his refrains. The imagery for the verse is drawn from  the Spanish poet, Garcilaso de la Vega, and from the &quot;Song of Songs&quot;. Through his sense of allusive eroticism and his aesthetic mysticism, the poet, furthermore, eliminates all ambiguity from his work. (DS)",

        "description":"A concept of the masses, or populace, conveyed a positive connotation in both Biblical and Renaissance literature. During Spain's Golden Age (seventeenth century) writers, especially didactic dramatists, tended to register negative and prejudiced attitudes toward the common folk and to regard them as \"masa inculta\" or uncultured masses. Primarily, this attitude followed a literary tradition inherited from Latin writings and was a result of the influence of Vulgar Latin on Spanish. Such terms as \"plebs\", \"turba\", and \"massa\" were used to describe mobs, whereas literary Latin referred to these groups as \"populus\" and \"gens,\" more positive terms. Other reasons for this air of superiority were that dramatists preferred to maintain a distance from their spectators, and playwrights  claimed a deterioration in the quality of their audiences. Each author varied slightly in his interpretation of \"vulgo\", but almost all of them referred to the populace frequently in their works. Among the writers cited are Cervantes, Calderon, Lope de Vega, and Juan de la Cueva. Later writers such as Tirso de Molina, Ricardo de Turia, and Guillen de Castro reversed the tendency and respected and identified with the masses in their dramas. (DS)",

When \"este\", \"ese,\" and \"aquel\" do not modify a noun, they have an accent mark (except in the neuter forms) and have the function of pronouns. The singular and plural articles in Spanish are derived from the Latin demonstrative pronouns. \"Ese\" in Spanish compares to the Latin \"iste\" and occasionally implies contempt, especially when placed after a noun. In other Spanish dialects (Leones and Aragones, for example) the demonstrative is expressed differently, but in each case the Spanish singular demonstrative was derived from the Latin nominative and the plural from the Latin plural accusative. Demonstratives were widely used in Medieval Spanish  literature and changed little in usage from Medieval to modern times. In French, the use and form of the demonstratives were determined formally in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Demonstratives were also used extensively in Medieval French literature, especially in romances and epics. However, in both Spanish and French, demonstratives show an even wider range in modern literature. Examples of the demonstrative in literary styles are given. (DS)",

They could also publish a newspaper front page, with the plot supplying the headline and lead article, the editorial presenting a critical review of the book, and news articles discussing author and characters. Another technique is for the student to assume the role of an agent for a publishing or movie company and \"sell\" the book. In evaluating the results of  either traditional or innovative projects, emphasis must be placed on positive teacher and peer group criticism--student enthusiasm should not be drowned in a sea of sharp words or red ink.

First, eight sixth-grade classes in four major geographic dialect areas completed a 150-word spelling test in which each word presented a particular phoneme whose spelling was predictable on a &quot;regular&quot; basis for the &quot;standard&quot; dictionary pronunciation. The number of times the particular phoneme was misspelled was compared to the number of times the word was misspelled at any point. Eight phonemes (out of 19) showed significant differences between at least two of  the geographic groups, indicating that the child's dialect affected his perception of phoneme-grapheme correspondences. In the second investigation, eight second-grade classes in the same schools were given six week-long lessons on specific phoneme-grapheme correspondence rules based on dictionary pronunciation. Although indefinite, the results indicated that teaching standard patterns had little effect upon the child's personal dialect. (Author/LH)",

Basically, Orff suggests that rhythmic patterns should be experienced in children's natural language as they improvise melodies and harmonies from nursery rhymes and supplement their musical awareness with simple, Orff-designed musical instruments. Kodaly approaches the understanding of musical concepts through the human voice and suggests a broad curriculum based on children's singing, playing, listening, moving rhythmically, and creating their own music. Suzuki, whose approach to violin playing can be transferred to other instruments, suggests that children should  be provided with a controlled musical environment from birth, with their parents and teachers guiding them through graded materials which progress parallel to their linguistic development. Such a learning program can meet children's musical needs by developing their aural sensitivity, pitch discrimination, and rhythmic responses at each level of their understanding. (JB)",

As part of the program, children read a book especially prepared for their age level describing the main \"members\" of the brass, woodwind, and string families, heard music composed or selected especially for them, listened to supplementary programed tapes, and visited with the professional performers. Extensive evaluations of the program were made from various points of view--professional musicians, teachers, administrators, and parents, and the consensus was that, despite minor shortcomings, the  program was successful. (Included in this report are an outline of techniques to implement the program; descriptions of the experiences of Bergen County with the professional ensembles; sample evaluation sheets; a bibliography to augment the program; and a pamphlet to be used in the classroom to introduce the brass \"family.\") (JB)",

The following six objectives of the pilot program are discussed at length: (1) to provide control of class, especially large groups; (2) to present poetry to students, using media especially adaptable to transmitting poetry; (3) to provide authoritative or professional interpretations of works of poetry; (4) to introduce students to aspects and forms of poetry that rely essentially upon visual experience as well as aural, and to integrate these aspects into the total  understanding of literature; (5) to determine whether the above practices are effective in increasing the students' appreciation of poetry; and (6) to develop more effective means of teaching the mechanics of poetry in the classroom situation.

There were four subject groups of children: 263 first graders in attendance during the 1966-67 school year, prior to the parent involvement program; 261 first graders attending during the experimental year of 1967-68, and 224 during 1968-69; and, 87 second graders in attendance during 1968-69. All were from the Wyandanch Public Schools. About five per cent of each class were Caucasian. An effort was made to get parents to visit the classrooms and to talk with the teachers, to assist the school with extra-curricular activities, and to be present at programs designed to provide information on the development and education of children.  Analysis of the data collected indicates that the beneficial effect of enlisting parent participation in the education of their children in a depressed area on the latter's academic achievement will be discernible only after several years of concerted effort, and will not produce any large, immediate, educational improvement.

Educational, administrative, and legislative leaders in New York State and at the national level were invited to participate along with graduate students and workshop participants. The conference's focus was set on \"The People\" by the keynoter, Father T. Weider. Representatives of legislation and of administration at the national and state levels provided both background and projections about the problems of education of  disadvantaged from their particular vantage points. During the afternoon session, the conferees met in six separate groups to discuss various issues. After meeting for about an hour and a half, everyone reassembled to hear the reports from each group.

About 20 percent of urban lower-class children have this response set difficulty and could benefit from an appropriate remedial program. This project has been aimed at developing a group-administered speech-sound test, appropriate for administration to young lower-class black urban children. Focus of the study has been more on identification of response set patterns rather than the evaluative criteria: subjective reaction of the testers to administration of various formats, general performance of children,  ability of a particular format to discriminate between initial and final phoneme performance, and reliability measures. Detailed item analyses have been made in order to locate problem areas of discrimination.

The overall hypothesis was that family verbal behavior or characteristic communicative style could provide various kinds of perspectives and rules for behavior that become internalized for school children. Furthermore, it was proposed that these communicative styles within the family enhance or curtail the children's ability to listen, attend, conceptualize, and sit still. Family interviews were designed to  identify communicational and cognitive levels. Also developed and pilot tested were behavioral tasks for small groups of children, administration of which permitted relevant communicational and cognitive behaviors to emerge. (KG)",

With regards to the last, one should try to account for differences in the behavior of identifiable social groups by looking for social causes. The relationship between the strength of the bonds attaching youths to social groups and the development of academic competence was investigated using data selected from a comprehensive study of a sample of 4077 drawn from the 17,000 secondary school students in western Contra Costa County in the spring of 1965. The social groups taken as salient in the environment of youths are the family, the peer group, the school, and the student's perception of the society as a whole. The Hemnon-Nelson group  IQ test was the criterion measure. The large disparities of some 15 IQ points between the off-spring of professional and of lower-class parents, and between blacks and whites are entirely interpreted by the set of intervening environmental variables.

The evaluation staff underestimated demands placed on the local coordinator, whose loyalty was divided between the community and the project. Delays in bimonthly pay checks created serious hardships, and were responsible for absenteeism among black mothers hired as testers. Chaos and violence in these women's lives were noted to  affect their work.

Racial unrest and unemployment are the products of an inadequate educational system which finds 25 percent of young people denied access to the labor force. The focus of vocational education must shift from a remedial to a preventive approach. Career consciousness should be fostered in the elementary grades accompanied with job-related instruction in the upper elementary grades. In high school, students should be allowed to move in and out of vocational-technical and academic courses, thus undermining the elitist system of tracking students into a terminal degree curriculum. In opposition to a policy which supports a separate  approach to education for the disadvantaged, a system which would address itself to the needs of all students (eliminating in the process the stigma attached to vocational courses) is needed. In order to encourage local school districts to supply adequate vocational and technical education opportunities, the Federal government should cover a substantial portion of costs and should provide leadership.

The arrangement of students and programs through grades five to eight will focus most upon a combination of small groups and independent study. The student has a personal advisor and confidant in his teacher-counselor, who is directly responsible for his education. The program will be based on a twelve-month school year, within which the student may stop and start as he needs to. The planned enrollment in the Middle School will be  1,500 students in the age range nine through 14 years. In the Middle School there will be eight sections, each of which will be home base for 188-190 students in a nongraded organization. The advent of pre-prepared curriculum materials, and the freedom of the student to develop his own materials and to plan along with the teacher counselor, will yield materials for individualized learning.

The experiences of a group of paraprofessionals hired in a special project in 1965 and 1966 by the National Committee on Employment of Youth (NCEY) provided data for the study. Obstacles were civil service requirements, professional standards, lack of supplementary training and education, and the insistence of a B.A. degree for eligibility to higher level jobs. Implementation of a national policy of guarantee of equal opportunity for advancement, (1) through measures designed to help paraprofessionals advance within the current framework of agency hiring policies and job  structures, (2) through measures designed to help agencies change that framework, and (3) through measures designed to help fields of service re-evaluate the total framework of their services and use of manpower, is recommended. Specific ways of implementing the above recommendations are summarized. Appended are background information on the NCEY questionnaire, and a list of agencies employing and/or training NCEY graduates.

Participation in the five-day census involved submitting a one-page form on every family for whom a request was received for service on behalf of a child or of children, the request including any application, referral, or inquiry made to the agency by telephone, letter, or in person. The chief findings were that: (1) a large proportion of requests were rejected or referred elsewhere, even when made to an agency having the service  requested; (2) nearly a tenth of the children for whom service was requested because of emotional problems were under six years of age; and, (3) striking racial differences were found not only in use of public versus voluntary agencies but also in the agency response to need.

One group of 32 was writing an innovative social studies curriculum; the other group of 44 consisted of teachers of the disadvantaged. Statements regarding the status quo and change in the areas of political, economic, educational, and personal aspects of society were sorted. The data suggest that: (1) both groups feel a need for change in educational settings, particularly as these relate to the black student and the black community; (2) curriculum writers reflect ideas of change to a greater extent than do  teachers; (3) this disagreement should be reflected by problems of acceptance and use of the new curricular materials; and, (4) the most likely explanation of these differences may be the process of involvement experienced by the curriculum writers.

School officials mistrust and poorly communicate with community representatives. Community agencies compete for the economic resources brought by decentralization, while overlooking the main objective of decentralization, that of the involvement of the community in educational planning. The administrative organization of many projects is faulty. School officials are not directly accountable for the progress of the projects; better monitoring is essential. If decentralized planning and conduct of educational projects is to be effective, there must be greater participation in planning and monitoring the projects by the community. There  is also a great need for improved performance on the part of school officials in the area of administration and supervision, and a greater willingness to accept and respond to criticism.

The modal respondent was white, female, married, from the Midwest, of middle-class origins, of average age 40, recipient of a B.A. or B.S. degree, and with little or no experience with disadvantaged children. Samples of 200 teachers considered effective with low income children and 100 considered ineffective were selected. An analysis of responses suggests that the effective teacher, in contrast to the ineffective teacher, accepts the physical deprivation of the disadvantaged, recognizes racial and social discrimination, does not  stereotype disadvantaged children, finds teaching the disadvantaged pleasant, accepts the liabilities of disadvantagement non-punitively, and accepts the existence of minority subcultures. Few background variables were related to these attitudes, and those relationships were slight. Most teachers indicate desire for improved training in teaching disadvantaged children. (JM)",

In one condition, subjects were required to earn the larger reinforcement by working during the delay period. A second group received pretraining delay experience involving smaller rewards and shorter delay intervals than those of the final criterion choice. A control condition involved only the criterion choice. As expected, disadvantaged children made more nondelay decisions than middle class subjects on the criterion choice, and the multiple pretraining experience was most effective in overcoming this nondelay tendency. However, disadvantaged children  were found to select a larger delayed reinforcement in situations involving a relatively short waiting period. These findings were related to social responsibilities, locus of control, and time perspective. Implications for compensatory education are discussed, and two subsequent investigations with disadvantaged populations are briefly described. (Authors)",

        "description":"The Second Grade Underachievers Program seeks to test the efficacy of educationally oriented play groups as a remedial educational technique as contrasted with individual tutoring, or a combination of tutoring plus educational play groups. The program attempts to interest and involve neighborhood agencies in more after-school programs that are educationally supportive in scope. Since seven-year-old children should be most receptive to educational material when it is presented creatively in the context of games, inasmuch as play is naturally more relevant to them than serious learning exercises, the project used innovative group play techniques to teach and reinforce learning by second graders diagnosed and referred to as underachievers by their teachers. The play technique, it is  felt, might also overcome the anxiety that underachieving second graders might feel in the classroom. (JM)",

Major findings are: (1) that lower employment levels of older nonwhite citizens are traceable, in part, to deficiencies in their educational attainment, but the younger nonwhite has  made great strides in closing the racial gap in education and (2) that despite continued improvement in income and occupation over the years and the drive to extend increased opportunities to all, the white-nonwhite gap in employment and earnings remain.

Five pre-delinquents from Achievement Place attended a special summer school mathematics class where study behavior and rule violations were measured daily for each boy. The boys were required to take a &quot;report card&quot; for the teacher to mark. The teacher simply marked &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; whether a boy had &quot;studied the whole period&quot; and &quot;obeyed the class rules.&quot; All &quot;yeses&quot; earned privileges in the home that day but a &quot;no&quot; lost all privileges.

        "description":"Disputing and talking out behaviors of individual pupils and entire classroom groups in special education classes and regular classes from white middle class areas and from all Negro disadvantaged areas ranging from the first grade to junior high school were studied. The classroom teacher in each case acted as the experimenter and primary observer. Various means of recording behaviors were used and reliability of observation was checked by an outside observer, another teacher, a teacher-aide, a student, or by using a tape recorder. Observation sessions varied from fifteen minutes to an entire school day. After baseline rates were obtained, extinction of inappropriate disputing or talking out behaviors and reinforcement of appropriate behavior with teacher attention, praise, and  in some cases a desired classroom activity or a surprise at the end of the week brought a decrease in undesired verbalizations. A reversal of contingencies brought a return to high levels of inappropriate talking, with a return to low levels when reinforcement for appropriate talking was reinstated. The experiments demonstrated that teachers in a variety of classroom settings could obtain reliable observational records and carry out experimental manipulations successfully using resources available in most schools.

Thus the expository function of evaluation is best met by ethnography. A conceptual model developed at the Central Midwestern Regional Educational Laboratory incorporates ethnographic data and techniques into curriculum evaluation. The model uses three dimensions: data, including scale measures, questionnaire responses, and participant observation; the role of the evaluation--which is either to evaluate a completed program or to evaluate a program in progress so that the results of evaluation may be used to modify the program, which is then re-evaluated; and, the focus of investigation, which is on student, mediator, or material. The mediator is  usually the classroom teacher. The model establishes the parameters of evaluation, and specifies and integrates three different approaches to evaluation. The ethnographic data may also serve as a source of new hypotheses and substantive theories. (JM)",

The education assistance committee reviews applications for assistance and recommends courses of action to the trustees of the REC Educational fund. The program's objectives are to encourage minority group youths in Racine to go on to higher education after graduation from high school; to work individually with those youths who wish assistance in obtaining a higher education, furnishing such counseling and supplementary financial aid as may be required; and, to encourage colleges and technical schools  attended by Racine minority students to respond to their particular needs which may call for individualized special arrangements. As a result of the REC education assistance program, 87 minority students from Racine enrolled in the fall of 1968 at 28 colleges and technical training schools at a total cost of $129,000. (JM)",

Major topics dealt with are: the significance of and the need for Americans to understand racism: the ways white racism appears to work in society; historical perspective relating overt racism to institutional subordination, and how they work; the economic, political, and psychological benefits provided by racism to whites; and, reinforcement of racism in modern society. Among the basic strategies suggested for combating racism are the following: (1) make all Americans--especially whites--far more  conscious of the widespread existence of racism in all its forms, and the immense costs it imposes on the entire Nation; (2) build up the capabilities of minority group members; (3) insure that minority group members are in position to contribute to the design, execution, and evaluation of all major social national policies and programs; and, (4) influence local, State, and national policies and programs, so that they have certain characteristics that will reduce their possible racist effects.

In lower grades where intelligence tests cannot be given effectively, socioeconomic status (SES) index with IQ score will be a better predictor of academic performance than prediction with IQ score alone. In the present study, a stratified random sample of three high schools (one rural, one small urban, and one large urban) was taken from the Island of Oahu. Both the urban schools had grades 7-9 only, while the rural school had grades 7-12. Data were collected for all students of grades 7, 9, and 12. From the school folders the following  information was obtained for each student: group IQ score, letter grades of the previous year, and the occupation and education of the student's father or guardian. Only the 799 cases for which complete information was available were retained in the sample. Step-wise regression analysis was done for SES, IQ, and grade point average (GPA), treating the first two variables as predictors, and the last as a criterion. Results indicate that both SES and IQ contribute significantly to the prediction of GPA, but the contribution of IQ is greater than that of the former.

Two instruments, the &quot;You and Your Future&quot; self-report inventory and the &quot;Life Goals Inventory,&quot; were used. Black seniors, especially female, tended to choose high level occupational titles more than white seniors did. Among the total occupational preferences, black males showed the highest degree of diversification. &quot;Material Value,&quot;&quot;Academic Value,&quot; and &quot;Altruistic Value&quot; were three determinants important to all.

A factor analysis was accomplished by use of a form of inverted matrix factor analysis. On the basis of this study it can be concluded that teachers can be grouped into four types on the basis of their attitudinal responses to children's speech. The types are found divided, both between and within type, roughly along lines of teacher race. Pronounciation deviations and pausal phenomena are correlatives of the subjective ratings for all teacher types, but teacher types differ roughly  along lines of race, in the correlations between subjective judgments and qualitative versus quantitative variables in the children's speech. This suggests that we could serve the future teachers in our schools best by making clear to them their own attitudes--toward the students in the inner-city or rural school, and toward the language these students are likely to be using.

Evaluative research sought to determine the feasibility of an interdisciplinary aerospace program, under the direction of average teachers, in motivating this group of low and underachieving pupils, characterized by negative self-perception, behavioral problems, poor attendance, truancy, high rates of suspension, and grades too poor for college entrance. Research objectives included a determination of the value of the  flight program in terms of increased motivation. That is, the extent the flight program has succeeded in (1) motivating the students to achieve academically; (2) motivating the students to attend school more regularly; (3) motivating the students to become involved a greater percentage of their classroom time in instructional and less disruptive and resistant behavior; (4) elevating the level of self-esteem and aspiration of the pupils; (5) improving the chances of higher education for the pupil; and, (6) altering the perception of the teachers and parents of these youths as regards their scholastic ability.

Of the two intervention strategies, the objective environment (world of things which a child manipulates) and the instrumental environment (world of people), this study employs the latter, the effective instrumental agent being the mother. In identifying the four variables (cognitive, motivational, personal style, and physical variables) associated with development of competency, some representative research findings  are considered. The instructional programs both for the mother and for the target child are described in detail. In the mother's program, called the Support System Mother's Program, the major objective in the cognitive domain was to change her pattern of interaction with the child by providing skills and resources which she could call upon to stimulate her child intellectually. In the child's program, called Socialization for Competence, provision is made for organizing and structuring skills to be learned. Partial interim results indicate, it is held, that the programs were generally successful although evaluation of soundness of the approach must wait. (RJ)",

Discussing the President's own responsibility, the decisions arrived at by  the Supreme and lower Courts, de jure segregation, and de facto segregation, the Chief Executive repeatedly emphasizes his stringent opposition to \"massive busing programs\" and his desire to allow \"school boards, acting in good faith, to formulate plans which best suit the needs of their own localities\" in the implementation of the process of desegregation. The principles of enforcement stated are held to encompass elimination of deliberate racial segregation of pupils and teachers and of discrimination with respect to school facilities, institution of the neighborhood school as the most appropriate base, and avoidance of interference in de facto racial imbalance.

Annually collected Census Bureau facts, the basis of much of the analysis presented in this paper, can be used to make more intelligent program-decision progress in the war against poverty. These facts, organized in terms of age, family status and size, race, sex, region, work experience and occupations, etc., must have several of these variables combined in order to be practicable. Tables reporting age differences only, or white-nonwhite differences only, for example, tend to contribute spurious information  for operating purposes. Furthermore such data must be studied in the form of time trends in order to detect degrees of progress for specific population categories.

The methodology used to project industry-occupational group trends of non-whites in Michigan is predicated upon a mathematical model consisting of four basic steps outlined in the report. Information is presented for the state as a whole, with special reference to changes in non-white and white population, labor force, and occupational and industrial structure. The proportion of non-white persons in Michigan continues to climb: from 4.1 percent of the population in 1940 to 9.4 percent of the population in 1960 with a projected 11.6 percent of the population by 1980. By 1980 the greatest growth in non-white  employment will be in these industries: professional and related service, public administration, business and repair service, entertainment and recreation service, wholesale and retail trade, construction, agriculture, forestry and fishery, and transportation, communication, utilities and sanitation. The least growth will be in manufacturing, personal service, mining, and finance, insurance, and real estate. The trend could be reversed in these areas of slow growth through government efforts and private action in training, upgrading and promotion. (CH)",

Eventually the system calls for all data to enter a central, state-wide electronic data processing center; however, the emphasis in this report is on the data collection system, not the storage and retrieval system. Prescored cards are prescribed for data collection along with the consideration of mark sensing and optical character scanning when their use is perfected. Field tests emphasized the necessity of  having all data processed at the state level, and the importance of a good public relations program to gain faculty cooperation. The tests also resulted in the modification of some forms and the elimination of the verification of address forms.

The most pressing need was for a  comprehensive placement program for each school and course. Evaluations of occupational needs and employment projections and of programs and recommendations are available as VT 010 561 and VT 010 560 respectively.

In 1966, interviews were conducted with 5,000 civilian men between 45 and 59 years of age. This report covers the second phase of the 5-year study which described magnitude of patterns of change. Of the 5,030 members interviewed in 1966, fewer than 300 were not reinterviewed in 1967. The largest change which occurred in terms of personal characteristics was the health of the respondents. About one-fifth reported some change between the first two interviews. Not much change was reported in labor and employment status. During the year, net change for  whites and Negroes was a 0.7 and 2.4 percent decline in employment. Although men in this age group usually had stable job attachments, job changing during the years was by no means negligible. One in ten worked for a different employer in 1967. Interview schedules, a glossary, and sampling, interviewing, and estimating procedures are appended. A report on the initial interviews of the study is available as ED 026 525 (RIE June 1969). (BC)",

It incorporates a learning center with separate treatment for fast, regular and slow learners, programed instruction, and teacher aides. Although it was developed primarily for teaching mathematics in a technical institute, the system has been used in other institute courses and in three other institutes, two high schools, and one junior high school.

Altogether, 250 interviews were conducted with federal officials responsible for administering the programs and with directors in selected metropolitan areas. In addition, questionnaires concerning experience in equal employment opportunity programs were mailed to 102 selected State and local civil rights leaders and 35 were returned. Some major conclusions and recommendations include: (1) While the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is beginning to control some of its problems, the commission needs to  increase its effectiveness by moving away from individual cases to broader self-starting activities, (2) More determined application of sanctions under Executive Order 11246 is imperative if the program is to be effective and respected, and (3) Closer linkages should be established between the equal job enforcement and manpower programs.

Relocatees must not be chosen from the hard core disadvantaged but from those with a value structure close to that of the middle class in rural Iowa, and employers with high turnover rates ought to be excluded from the program. The optimum number of persons that can be moved each year is about 25 families. Iowa farmers have shown receptivity in considering the hiring of Mississippi blacks. Successful families have generally been those with stable marital and family relationships and  have possessed a mature approach to work. The project has offered hope of social and economic improvement to a small number of Delta families and the experience to date indicates that continuation of the project would provide benefits to workers, employers, and society as a whole.

Nine presentations, each followed by a critique, concerned (1) the role and functions of the chemical technician in industrial research and production, (2) the curriculum content and institutional role of chemical technician education, and (3) the role of educational institutions and professional associations in programs of continuing education for the chemical technician. Suggested and current chemical  technology curriculums are included. (CH)",

Such problems have been conceptualized into a model which relates specific problems to dimensions of self and environment in three developmental stages: (1) pretransitional--the life period before an individual is activated to seeking his first full-time job, (2) transitional--marked by activation to seek first full-time employment, occurring during grade 12 for about one-half of high school students, and (3) post-transitional-the first job. Using this model, perceptions of the vocational development of New York youth were obtained from staff members in 40 schools, 27 employers, and 14 new workers. Suggestions for programs, activities, and facilities are tabulated by problem area, and  public factors are ranked by strength score. The strongest trasitional needs were identified in areas of preparatory education and training, occupational information, self-actualization, worker role, job placement, mobility, and occupational mobility. There was no attempt to investigate causative factors; however, some causal inferences are drawn. Recommendations are included. (CH)",

Future studies should: (1) concentrate only on those leaving agriculture or those entering, (2) determine size of the family in which husband or wife was reared and if there had been financial assistance from the family, and (3) obtain more quantitative measurements of participation with farmer's age and status.

        "description":"This study was initiated in 1964 under the sponsorship of the Cooperative Research Program of the Office of Education to develop and supply data useful to policy makers and planners of training programs for research, development, and diffusion personnel in education. The first task was the construction of a logical structure to account for the formally defined institutional roles, from which a picture of the research community in 1964 could be drawn and future demand projected. Chapter 2 provides a general description of the community in 1964, analyzing it by institutional settings and researchers' roles, estimating the actual number of researchers and the number being added to the community. Chapter 3 deals in detail with the procedures used, funding projections, and personnel  projections. Chapter 4 considers the effects of curtailment of funds for ESEA Title IV research training programs which will reinforce the existing pattern rather than enable new centers for training and roles for researchers to be established. Finally an attempt is made to define the roles which could be expected to emerge under the new research, development, and diffusion funding programs, namely director and staff of outside-funded development programs, technical support personnel, development project personnel, training personnel, and stimulators and coordinators of activities. Eight appendixes give additional documentation. (MBM)",

It is divided into eleven chapters, each dealing with one aspect of teacher education. Chapter I discusses the role of education and of teachers in a democratic society. Chapter II presents a history of teacher education in the United States and contrasts its pre-World War I status with its present status. Chapter III discusses the goals of teacher education and the development of a curriculum related to these goals. Chapters IV, V, and VI are concerned with the three parts of the teacher education program--academic education, professional education, and field experience programs--and Chapter VII discusses the organization of these  three parts into a sequential program. Chapter VIII is concerned with the role of the teacher educator and his obligation to meet the individual needs of teacher trainees. Chapter IX points out the importance of student personnel work in teacher education programs and develops guidelines for inservice training of student personnel workers. Chapter X is concerned with the administration of teacher education and student participation. Finally, Chapter XI develops some ideas for future development of teacher education, based on trends noted in the preceding chapters. (RT)",

        "description":"The centrality of bibliographic records in library automation, objectives of the bibliographic record file and elemental factors involved in bibliographic record creation are discussed. The practical work of creating bibliographic records involves: (1) data base environment, (2) technical aspects, (3) cost and (4) operational methodology. The application of automated processes to library service functions is dependent on the availability of appropriately structured and functional bibliographic data files. There is a general lack of such files. The known bibliographic record files range widely in their scope of coverage, size, detail of data coverage, functional orientation, and method and cost of production. As a rule they are not mutually compatable. The machine readable  bibliographic record services offered by the Library of Congress and the British National Bibliography constitute a trend in distribution of machine readable records of standardized definition and multi-purpose functionality to the library world at consistently increasing rate. Although cooperative creation of large bibliographic record files appears to be a feasible objective for the coming decade, it is not clear to what extent a similar sharing by the small library of the required computing services will become possible for purposes of cooperative utilization of the cooperative bibliographic data files.

        "description":"Following a discussion of the major trends in higher education, the response of academic libraries to these developments is considered, with particular attention to developments related to undergraduate libraries, community college libraries, learning resources centers, the independent study movement, the library-college movement and library programs in experimental colleges. The base line for this selective, evaluative and interpretive review was provided by a bibliography based on a literature search conducted by the ERIC Clearinghouse for Library and Information Science staff at the University of Minnesota. Emphasis is on publications since 1965. A major impression received from reviewing the literature on library services for undergraduate education is that a great deal more  is said about what ought to be done than about what is actually being done. A second and related general impression is that the library response to new developments in undergraduate education is disappointing because so little of a truly innovative nature is occurring in undergraduate education itself. Exceptions to these generalizations are noted. The text is followed by a list of references. (NH)",

        "description":"This review summarizes the major criticisms of standardized tests and testing and attempts an evaluation of the validity of the criticisms. Viewed in the context of type of test, manner of its use, and assumptions regarding its validity, the paper discusses: (1) the imperfect-prediction problem, where predictions of performance are invalidated by small differences between members of a group being tested, by assumption of existence of linear relationship between qualities tested and later occupational success, and by difficulties raised by presence of qualities not measured by standardized tests; (2) the rigid reliance on standardized test scores; (3) inherited versus acquired abilities; and, (4) the contribution of tests to their own validity of functioning as self-fulfilling  prophecies. Criticisms that are independent of test validity are also examined: the difficulty for children to acquire the ability to deal with issues on which there is no clear right or wrong answer; the contention that teachers and schools are being evaluated along with the children; the general impact of tests on curriculums; and, the implications for the groups when tests are used to sort individuals into groups. Concluding remarks focus on the consideration of the social effects of tests, and on the need to develop rational and systematic policies regarding use of tests with the culturally disadvantaged, dissemination of test results, and the problem of invasion of privacy.

Attention is focused on the future content of tests and on their effects on young people. The existing program of the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) and the way the program functions to improve relations between schools and colleges are examined. The article also traces the history of the CEEB, focusing on a quarter century of agitation in the last half of the nineteenth century which revolved around the diversity of entrance requirements of different colleges. In this context, the CEEB is held to have been created to bring order out of chaos and not to solve problems in the selection of students for admission.  In particular, the paper disagrees with the holding of achievement tests in the month of December purely for the convenience of colleges. The problems and prospects for listening comprehension tests in modern languages are examined critically. (RJ)",

The use of test internationally is also treated. Particular attention is paid to research undertaken by the Board, especially in relation to a report made to the trustees of the Board in 1964. This  report identified the Board's research and development programs as having the following objectives: to describe and project changes in the admissions process, to develop models of the admissions process, to develop strategies for dealing with existing or anticipated problems, to implement programs for effecting strategies, and to evaluate new programs. Among the areas noted as necessitating further research were: students' motives to attend college; guidance procedures; channels of access to higher education; financial restrictions; admissions procedures and standards; and, the problems of the talented, disadvantaged, and international student.

A Commission on Tests is held desirable, the general purpose of which is to describe a comprehensive series of testing activities supporting the large-scale distribution of students among college level institutions in the United States, under conditions in which as much as 80 percent high school graduates and 70 percent of 18-year-olds (and together with significant numbers of adults) will enter college each year. While suggesting preservation of some very important strengths in present testing procedures by CEEB, the Board's testing activities are held inadequate. Guidelines for the future educational setting of college admissions and guidance tests are  presented. It is contended that the description of the proposed tests should focus on the general population of young people at four points in their educational careers--in grades seven and eight, in grades ten and eleven, at the end of grade twelve, and in the thirteenth and fourteenth years by age. Review of the theory and practice underlying existing tests and relating these to current knowledge and generally accepted principles in a number of fields (psychometrics, education, linguistics, sociology and anthropology, and cybernetics and computer sciences) is recommended. An initial description of the objectives of future tests is also included. (RJ)",

If the College Entrance Examination Board should have to follow paths such as these, it has ahead of it the enormous job of transforming drastically the nature of its activities. Three possible stages are envisaged in the future development of the Board's tests: (1) for the immediate future, an extension of the recent trend toward the diversity of programs and of tests within programs (this being the stage of the multiplex external program); (2) a reduction of emphasis on external examinations and increased reliance on the record compiled by the student in his own school  (this being the stage of the school-based program); and, (3) a system, eventually, of examinations in which each student is presented with the individual questions most pertinent to his past preparation and to his responses to test questions earlier in the sequence (this being the stage of the student-based program). It is held that the examination program should match both students and educational programs in diversity. (JM)",

The inaugural address provided a world perspective on, and a philosophical analysis of, problems in education for democratic living. The director's working paper stressed the need for universal adult education, while the President's paper stressed the needs of the age group 15-45. Other papers dealt with the need to develop enlightened public consciousness; discussed the nature of this consciousness; and offered suggestions for a  national plan of adult education for parliamentary democracy. Several recommendations on program planning and administrative organization were also presented. (LY)",

Erasmus (&quot;Community Development and the Encogido Syndrome&quot;), the author argues that community development should be defined in a more restricted fashion than has been done; that the techniques and limitations of the community development worker should be more clearly recognized; that the necessity for the community development worker turning to technical experts for certain kinds of specialized help be admitted; that the community development worker accept the responsibility to organize the unorganized, to transfer the decision-making process to the community, and to leave when he has done this and not become a permanent fixture in the client community. Community development is not something which a worker does, but rather  a process which a worker helps to bring about. To be successful community development must become an interdisciplinary approach not only in its implementation but also in its theoretical formulation. (MF)",

It was undertaken to teach reading; assess the use of volunteers in adult literacy education; evaluate two reading methods for use with adult illiterates voluntarily studying in a community setting; and gather and communicate basic knowledge on illiteracy, adult illiterates, and program organization and administration. Much attention was given to analyzing statistical data on student and volunteer tutor backgrounds, student attendance, reactions to training, results of reading and related tests, reading progress at three stages, and factors assumed to have inhibited prior development  of learning skills. A major finding was that Reading in High Gear and the Approach of the Massachusetts Council for Public Schools (MCPS) had similar shortcomings, but that the varied materials of the MCPS system permitted greater flexibility for experimentation toward meaningful change.

Growers were divided into four adopter categories: laggards, late majority, early majority, and innovator-early adopters. Although the level of adoption was generally high, the higher levels of practice adoption occurred among those growers characterized by larger farms and higher incomes who were relatively younger, were better educated, and who had better educated wives. Ethnic differences in patterns of personal contact and of adoption were noted. The study concluded that personal contacts were far more effective than impersonal sources of  information in effecting the adoption of innovations; that the extension service tends to concentrate on personal contacts with a few farmers and to use impersonal contacts for the majority; and that the extension service's use of group instruction and local opinion leaders can extend the range of personal contacts and thus more effectively encourage innovation.

Performance was measured by 14 teacher designed tests (one every two weeks) on progress and performance in mathematics, grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and current events. Individuals were admitted to the program by age (18-45), sex (both), educational level (Grade 12 or under), annual income ($2000 or under), and reading level (Grade 9 or less).

Background data were gathered on age, sex, employment status, family and marital status, occupation when enrolled, and present occupation and employment. There were 58 tuition and 42 nontuition students. Outcomes were analyzed for job changes or promotions (35 positive changes); increased income (for 18 of the above 35); other tangible and intangible benefits (perceived by 56); persons (26) planning to continue their education or training; those desiring additional high school subjects (37); desired subjects and training; and city and school to be attended. All graduates but two would recommend the program to others. Evaluations of  the quality of teaching and the amount of work required for graduation were largely favorable, and suggestions for improvement were few. Most graduates indicated that all their subjects were helpful. (Included are a questionnaire, covering letters, and 30 tables.) (LY)",

Six steps in planning are outlined: state long-term agency goals; set specific objectives; identify subsystems; define tasks; organize them into jobs; and organize jobs into career ladders.

Programs have been expanded since 1953, and now include both general extension (subsidy programs) and educational extension. Comparison of personal characteristics of hsien (county) Farmers' Association supervisors and government supervisors revealed differences in length of job tenure, emphasis on general or educational extension, involvement in program planning, and perception of extension objectives and the means to be used in achieving them. There was a marked tendency for hsien Farmers' Association supervisors to perform their supervisory extension by developing and helping township extension workers to carry on better educational extension  programs, while hsien government supervisors emphasized interpretation of government policies and passing on government instructions to township extension workers for execution. The government supervisors' objective is to implement government production policies rather than to help township extension workers perform educational roles or develop farm people and life situations. Restructuring of agency functions could improve extension services. (MF)",

Interviews were conducted with 13 New Careerists (68% of those in the program) and 12 supervisors in the employ of the Agency. The study was based primarily on responses to questionnaires which dealt with job performance, problems, communication, and personal involvement in the program. The evaluations of both participants and supervisors were quite positive, and on the basis of these responses the program seems to be a success. Factors contributing to success include the following: selection criteria for participants (who had a  mean educational level of 11.3 years); quality of on-the-job training; youthfulness of supervisors; positive attitudes of employees; and the socially-oriented nature of the agency.

He states that a strategy for New Careers programs must be constructed which deals with the need for development of specific skills. Career ladders must not be dead ends; they must prepare the individual for available jobs, and they must leave open the opportunity for advancing to higher skill levels within a field.

Industry-sponsored training programs are planned for existing job needs; some government-sponsored programs have become dead ends because they were planned on the expectation of development of new types of jobs before the programs were completed, and the expectation was never realized.

Industry has moved to the suburbs and there has been an increase in service-oriented occupations. To meet the challenge posed by the changes, we need to develop a strategy of looking at the service itself, at its functions, and asking how to design, create, and provide a more meaningful, humane system of education, health, and social services. The recall of retired teachers and other professionals is not the solution. The writer advocates integration so that at every level that a human being functions in a human service agency, his training or education enables him to function  adequately and competently. With this in mind, nurses' aides who are given additional responsibility when the professional nurses are absent need more training. Furthermore, shortages can be met by recruitment of teachers' and nurses' aides from a vast reservoir of motivated, interested individuals in the city. (NL)",

The author reports on an experiment conducted by the staff of the Southwest Educational Laboratory among lower socioeconomic class children in Watts and neighboring areas of Los Angeles. Their findings conflict with Bereiter and Engelmann's in demonstrating that such children are able to ask questions of several types, to give explanations, to draw inferences, to exchange and give information, and to use complex sentences. It is suggested that group interviews are most successful in eliciting language from these children and that faulty interviewing techniques may account for the results  obtained by Bereiter and Engelmann. Finally the author warns that if linguists, whose primary task is to show how children learn and use language, do not take the lead in demonstrating the invalidity of the theory of verbal deprivation, they may be considered passive contributors to \"institutionalized racism,\" which is manifested \"when the social scientist enshrines canons of objectivity and academic detachment to a point where the meaningful or insightful study of human affairs is precluded.\" (FWB)",

        "description":"This paper uses a discussion of experiments with aphasics' use of verbally derived nouns to illustrate how one linguistic model may be superior to another in accounting for the facts of verbal behavior. The models involved are the transformational, which relates derived nominals to their source verb and lists only the verb in the lexicon, and the lexicalist, which lists both noun and verb together in the lexical entry. Subjects, sufferers from a type of aphasia in which the ability to use verbs is impaired to a greater extent than the ability to use nouns, were given a stimulus word (noun or verb) and asked to use the word in a sentence or explain its meaning. It was revealed that aphasics who have difficulty in using a verb can quite often produce the nominal derived from that  verb with relative ease. The phenomenon was interpreted as suggesting that the lexical entry is coded in the brain in both its verbal and nominal forms and under the noun-facilitation circumstances, the nominal form is retrievable. It was felt that the lexicalist approach was able to reflect this phenomenon of brain function in a simple and elegant way, whereas the transformational model would be able to account for the phenomenon only by a complicated and implausible set of principles of brain function.

The teacher who, however, wants to capitalize on the verbal and cultural resources which students bring to the classroom must elicit language from the students, getting them to talk in such a way that they reveal not merely their interests but something about the linguistic and social systems within which they operate as well. This document presents a set of questions which provide the teacher with guidelines for interpreting the information thus elicited from students. Questions  concentrate on the ways in which the language and culture of a student may be different from that represented in teaching materials. The following topics are covered in this preliminary version: giving and receiving directions for travel, telling time, assuming responsibility, internalizing syntax, and manipulating count and mass nouns. Many of the questions can be used by teachers in any subject area, and many are applicable for students at a variety of age levels. (FWB)",

Chapter 1 summarizes the transformational generative theory on which the study is based, discusses the concept that Thai is a \"simple\" language in comparison with English, and briefly outlines the structure of Thai noun phrases, Chapter 2 outlines the development of transformational grammar and presents the base component of a transformational grammar. Chapter 3 discusses the use of transformations and describes the transformational rules needed to generate the structures directly underlying the compounds themselves. Chapter 4, working from the assumption that most Thai noun compounds are derived from noun phrases in  which sentences have been embedded as relative clauses, demonstrates how certain structures generated by the grammar proposed in the earlier chapters can be converted into Thai noun compounds. Compounds are analyzed by type. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the small subset of noun compounds considered to be learned compounds and offers solutions to the problems presented by such forms.

The data from the author's investigation tends to support the third position. A statistical difference significant at the .01 or .05 level seems to confirm the author's hypotheses that Negro children and adults show a higher proportion of nonstandard grammatical forms than do the corresponding white children and adults, and that the  children show proportionately higher nonstandard usage than do their parents. The data here suggest that differences between the races decrease with age. Discussed also are methods used to collect and analyze data, and recommendations for selecting informants, questionnaires and outside consultants. (AMM)",

Major hypotheses of the study were that (1) there is a factor in the abilities of an English-as-a-second-language speaker which can be isolated as English language ability; (2) a low TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score will occur with poor adjustment scores; and (3) there will be a significant difference in the mean scores of the two intelligence tests used (the Otis Gamma Verbal and the Chicago Nonverbal). Results seem to warrant two conclusions: (1) the TOEFL is a valid measure of English language skill of American Indian students; results are close enough to those of the  non-native speakers of English for whom the test was written to suggest strongly that similar abilities are being measured; and (2) since the TOEFL and ITED (Iowa Test of Education Development) do not factor out into different factors, ITED also measures language ability. ITED may be too hard for the students, however. It is recommended that American Indian students be given the same consideration as foreign students, with intensive or semi-intensive instruction in English as need, and adjustment of course load if indicated.

The hazards of viewing these people from the aspects of emotional problems, character defects, etc., are explained and illustrated. The demographic variables of age, sex, marital status, living arrangement, number of children, race and education are discussed in terms of the selected groups. Some factors which could have contributed to the group characteristics are mentioned. The intention of the whole discussion was to suggest that such demographic variables can be used to assess the pressures, resources, liabilities and  problem solving strategies of public assistance applicants, with no necessary reliance on traditional terminology and assessment techniques. Actual data and elaborate statistical analyses were not presented and, by the author's own admission, more elaborate mathematical techniques would be necessary to produce precise and usable knowledge of relationships.

In the first, Dr. Marc Berger stated unequivocally that Education, as traditionally viewed, is mythology. Its potential for bringing about change in the social order is non-existent; the task is beyond its scope. Dr. William Birenbaum, in the second presentation, questioned a wide spectrum of personnel-student relationship problem areas. Hypocrisy on the part of college leadership has kept due process and integration of people, subject matter and programs off the American Campus. Deans of students, he concluded, by being part of this, are now obsolete. Next, Dr. Arnold Buckheimer emphasized the need for dialogue and confrontation if college personnel are to be what he thinks they  must be, viz., change-agents who meet students' needs. Dorothy Knoell defined disadvantagement and specified program and curriculum developments which are aimed at reaching this group. In a related talk, Dr. Carolyn Sherif discussed her 10 year study of the behavior, attitudes, and goals of disadvantaged youths. Dr. Louis Lieberman, in the final paper, discussed the problems of socialization of the two-year college student and the ramifications should these be overlooked. (TL)",

Now, however, many schools are threatened by the very things they have tried to instill in their students. Students are demanding a more relevant education, fairer discipline practices, and a greater opportunity to participate in the decision making processes of their schools. A great deal of student unrest can be attributed to a lack of communication. Therefore, the following suggestions are offered to improve the educational climate and better human relations within our schools: (1) principals and teachers need to develop a greater understanding of today's student and learn new skills to deal with him and his problems; (2) Counseling  services should be expanded and improved; (3) student councils should be given more authority; and (4) the curriculum should be modified so that greater emphasis is placed on current problems and issues.

Training organizers deals with problems of how to motivate others and what tactics should be used when difficulty is encountered. Two approaches to these problems determined by images of 20th Century Man have been employed: (1) rational economic man who emphasizes punishment as sole means for social change; and (2) irrational, destructive Freudian man who brings about social change by altering the inner lives of other people. Both approaches rely on selective portions of what is apparent in human conduct. A new perspective on man's behavior (operant psychology), which holds that the understanding of man comes through examining his behavior and the conditions under which it occurs, has  emerged. A training situation was set up which placed trainees in a state of deprivation (arranging for an event to be reinforced), followed by successive approximation (gradual build up from current behaviors to the training goal behaviors).

The study included proportional numbers of fifth grade students from four community classification strata (center city, suburban, rural farm and rural non-farm) and their teachers from 11 elementary schools. Pretest consisting of IQ tests, arithmetic achievement tests and sociometric paired comparison tests were administered. Similar post tests were administered five months later, excluding the IQ test. Teachers completed a sociometric paired comparison of each pupil's arithmetic performance. Four major conclusions are drawn: (1) achievement is  positively correlated with status within the classroom, but achievement could be treated as a separate construct independent of status; (2) as a predictor of achievement IQ was more accurate than pretest achievement; (3) sociometric status variables did not improve accuracy of achievement prediction when IQ and achievement pretests were in the equation; and (4) there were no significant differences among the four types of communities with respect to prediction of achievement.

He notes that few student movements have occurred without faculty participation and enumerates three types of students who join in campus violence: (1) a group largely represented by Students for a Democratic Society; (2) an unorganized group concerned with such issues as the American foreign policy in Vietnam, our defense commitments and justice  for the black community; and (3) a large group of college students demanding more liberal curriculum goals and improvement in instruction. Listed are several recommendations to channel the energy of dissident youth: (1) the need for institutional change; (2) increased parental responsibility for their children; and (3) administrators who deal with real issues and genuine student involvement.

The most useful experience was getting acquainted with other freshmen. Having the experience of living in a residence hall for a short time was the second most helpful, and in last place was meeting with university officials. Regular advisors were found to be more helpful than summer advisors. The underlying theme was that advisors need more factual  information about available courses and the requirements for various majors.

A total of 148 college students participated in the study, 63 of whom were assigned to the experimental group. All subjects took two tests: the I-E Scale, and a multiple choice test of verbal ability, which also provided a measure of time utilization. Results included: (1) support of the hypothesis that Internals would use time in a manner more appropriate to the task than would Externals; and (2) the hypothesis that Externals would be more variable than Internals in the amount of time spent at all levels of item difficulty was not supported. Actually, Internals were more variable than Externals in the amount of time  spent on items. A total of two additional analyses were performed post hoc in order to examine the possibilities that the findings reflected ability differences or sex differences rather than Internal-External differences. Ability was eliminated as a confounding variable. The analysis of sex differences indicated that not blocking on sex had a dampening effect on the results. (KJ)",

        "description":"In this study, the relationship between students' expectations for the environment of the college they are about to enter and the level of formal education completed by their parents was investigated. It was hypothesized that entering freshmen students whose parents both had only a high school education differed from entering freshmen whose parents were both college graduates in their expectations for the universities' environment. Students' expectations were measured by using the College and University Environment Scale (CUES). On the basis of students' responses to a question asking the occupational level of their fathers, students were placed into one of eight categories. A total of 82 students were then given the CUES. Findings include: (1) it may not be useful to categorize  students only on the basis of parents' level of education; and (2) significant differences between sexes in their expectations were found. However, this may vary from campus to campus. (SJ)",

Forms 4A and 4B of the mathematical subtest of School and College Ability Tests were used to measure treatment effects. The competitive treatments had no significant effect on performance but significantly increased  the childrens' interest in the test. There was no difference between the two significant treatments; competition with a game was as effective as competition with a reward for both performance and interest measures. The speculation is made that the relative magnitude of the performance and interest effect is directly related to the nature of the task. That is, competition increases performance more in a speed task than in a power task; and competition increases interest more in a power task than in a speed task. (Author/RSM)",

The sample consisted of 100 entering freshmen, 100 upperclassmen, 228 transfer students at a Collefe of the State University of New York. The students responded to Stern's College Characteristics Index which measured what they thought was generally true of college life. At the conclusion of the first semester the grade point average and satisfaction score, determined by the Student Satisfaction Questionnaire, were ascertained for each student. It was found that both freshmen and transfer students had unrealistic expectations of the college environment and anticipated a high intellectual  or non-intellectual climate. The effect of the unrealistic expectations of transfer students on academic performance and satisfaction was somewhat unexpected and not altogether clear. Positive correlations were shown between grade point average and total disparity score for part of the sample, and small negative correlations were discovered between satisfaction and grade point average. Assimilation of the new students was accomplished early in the first semester and their perceptions became more realistic after approximately three months of classes. (Author/RSM)",

Four general objectives for the project are stated. These deal with motivation for learning subject matter knowledge and skills, developing independence, assuming increasing self direction, and conceptualizing a value system. There are 17 specific behaviors related to the four general objectives. All students were given a self-assessment sheet to complete. Teachers also rated the children on behavior. Students were then assigned to conference groups. The conferences were non-directive in nature, each child setting his own goal and his progress toward it. Motivational principles used in addition to the goal setting were reinforcement,  feedback, and reasoning. At the conclusion of the conferences, each child again rated his own behavior, while the teacher also rated him. Results showed that children really improved in their behavior. Only the individualized conference group showed a significantly higher gain than did the no conference control group. (SJ)",

The premise was that cultural and social variations do exist within as well as between social groupings. A stratified selection technique was employed to select schools for the study. A total of three distinct geographic areas were identified, and three schools from each were selected for the study. Student questionnaires and family interviews were used to obtain data. General conclusions were: (1) just over half of the mothers and fathers were born in the United States; (2) the population was stable; (3) families were large; and (4) education level was low. A major assumption was that an  analysis of specific generations might reveal significant sub-group differences in cultural and social patterns. Students were therefore placed in one of four groups: (1) Mexican immigrant; (2) first generation Mexican-American; (3) second generation Mexican-American; and (4) American. Results showed that the greatest changes occur between immigrant children and third generation or more American families. Changes and trends toward acculturation were also evident in the three closely identified Mexican-American groups. (SJ)",

For reliability purposes, it was deemed that a minimum of 30 or more semantic scales, used as individual items would be essential. A seven position ordinal scale was interposed between each pair of bipolar adjectives forming the 25 semantic scales. A total of 610 student records were used in the standardization process, 287 were high school students, 323 were college students. All semantic scales were subjected to an item analysis, and only those items were retained which correlated .20 or better, with the total score for all three concepts: (1) what I learned in this class; (2) the teacher of this class; and (3) me as a student.  Each of the 35 scales were assigned values ranging from one to seven for the seven adjective positions on the interposed ordinal scales. Little difference was obtained among the reliabilities for the three variations of the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20. The Likert technique was used to compute three part scores, with the three part scores being the total score on the test. The intercorrelations of scores on the test were computed separately for pre- and post-course administration. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (SJ)",

This study is also a further step in clarifying the dimensions measured by the Developmental Scales through the use of trait adjectives.

The instruments used were the Sage Developmental Scales and Gough's Adjective Check List. The research design was essentially a double cross-validation one. Subjects included two groups of male students, and two groups of female students during a freshman orientation program. The general hypothesis was supported. The  personological dimensions that emerged were quite similar for both sexes, yet differed in degree and quality. High scoring males and females alike can be described as suspicious, emotionally unstable, anxious and lacking in drive. These dimensions show that a developmentally immature freshman needs to experience certain remedial task situations, which might best be learned within a small peer group where socially competent models could teach adaptive responses.

These included: (1) 50 Special Education and Rehabilitation Workers; (2) 50 parents of mentally retarded children; (3) 50 regular school teachers; and (4) 82 parents of the nonretarded. The purposes were: (1) to investigate their attitudes toward the mentally retarded; and (2) to assess the predictive validity of hypothesized determinants of attitudes, including demographic, socio-psychological, contactual, and knowledge factors. The Guttman conceptual facet analysis scheme was applied toward the goal of credibility of results. Eleven hypotheses were presented, ten of which dealt with certain variables which were predicted to relate to attitudes toward mental retardation.  Results were presented and discussed. (TL)",

        "description":"This study was an investigation into the relative predictive abilities of two types of test anxiety measures. Galvanic skin response (GSR) levels obtained during achievement testing and a self-report measure of test anxiety, the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC), were used as predictors of IQ and achievement test performances of 119 fifth and sixth grade subjects. It was found that the TASC accounted for little of the variance associated with test performance. Because the correlations between the GSR measures and TASC scores were quite low or negative in direction, it was suggested that the TASC may not be measuring anxiety at all, but rather some characteristic associated with aptitude. The GSR scores when combined for all students in each of the two distinct analyses  produced few significant relations with test performance. The GSR demonstrated a greater relationship with achievement than IQ performance when subjects were grouped in upper and lower categories. (Author)",

We must seek to do our part in eliminating these forces and to replace them with constructive ones. SPW was developed to meet this challenge and was innovated as an effort to individualize mass education in an effort to humanize personal development. We need to induce each student to strive for individual values within mass society. This has been the historic mission of SPW. Today, however, as we face new problems and stresses, we need to explore what forms of SPW need to be reorganized and what new services need to be developed. Some needed changes include: (1) research on human development; (2) a new emphasis on  learning to think clearly; (3) a realization that violence is not a panacea for inequality; (4) the establishment of new forms of orientation (loyalty and moral commitment) to school and college; (5) the implementation of a joint faculty, administration, student redelineation of the functions, privileges, and authority, and relationships of all three components; and (6) a restructuring of service relationships to enhance the worth and dignity of all.

However, the very introduction of sensational sub-systems may well divert attention from the critical problems in guidance departments for longer periods of time. It takes a system to help decide what questions to ask systematically, and until the strands of the guidance operations are woven together in the minds of practicing counselors computer operations can never be more than attachments to  already existing resources found in guidance offices. The counselor's role will be enhanced when he asks for help in establishing his department's \"system.\" When he does establish this dynamic framework of priority-placed objectives, he will be in an excellent position to use the information sub-systems developed by others.

As a result, many of the family's traditional functions have been taken over by other social agencies. From this perspective it seems certain that comprehensive sex education programs will soon become a reality in our schools. It is imperative that a positive approach be taken toward the outrage and protests of many concerned parents. There is a need for greater awareness of and sensitivity to the sources of this concern. The following three procedures could be beneficial in calming the fears of parents: (1) programs and courses on sex education for parents should be implemented. Such courses would help the adult understand his own sexuality; (2) there should be close parental involvement in  the establishment and content of the sex education courses; and (3) means should be provided for wide dissemination of information about resources and materials on sex education.

Ten groups of students were randomly formed from the volunteers. Six of these were experimental groups which met with a volunteer faculty member assigned to meet with them. Three similar groups served as control groups and met without a professor. Student participation behavior was pre-tested and post-tested by the Omnibus Personality Inventory and  behavior differences between experimental and control subjects were assessed at the end of the experimental treatment. The results of this study corroborate the findings of prior research that faculty members do not significantly influence student behavior development. One important exception, however, was that contact with a professor under these experimental conditions may have produced in students a greater concern for others and a greater tendency toward personal trusting relationships. Implications of these findings for higher education are suggested. (RSM)",

The conditions were stated as: (1) a conversation (2) between persons of unequal status (3) of some duration in which one participant (4) is motivated to change and (5) may be psychologically distressed. The author provides an example and concludes that laboratory research which evaluates relevant hypothesis and attends to boundary conditions, fills the gap between basic research and counseling practice.

This study, a component of Havighurst's National Study of American Indian Education, seeks to gain a better understanding of Indian offenders in Minnesota. Data concerning new court commitments from July 1, 1967 through June 30, 1968, are presented and analyzed. The characteristics of Indian new court commitments are described according to age, sex, offenses, residence by county and state, family situation, level of intelligence, employment status, and prior psychiatric treatment. A brief evaluation of and suggestions for improving American institutions, specifically correctional institutions, are compiled into a dozen responses pertinent to Minnesota Indians and  based on the collected data. The report concludes with a telescopic exposition of one such response, i.e., Project Newgate, which is an experimental test of the proposition that higher education can be an effective instrument of rehabilitation in correctional institutions. A proposal for Indian Project Newgate as a supplement to the original Newgate in Minnesota is outlined. (TL)",

Old techniques for assessing competence were analyzed and found inadequate. Specific instruments developed in the project are described in detail. They include: (1) rating forms; (2) tests and test manuals; (3) forms for profile scoring and reporting of test results;  and (4) observational forms for process analysis of tests.

Throughout the program, students are seen as problem-solvers, partners in the process of education. The Developmental Guidance Program presented in this paper was designed to facilitate the student in this role of exploration and the formation of tentative decisions about long range educational and occupational goals.

The Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS) was used to evaluate participants prior to and after their group experiences. The findings include the following: (1) on pre-testing the control group scores were consistently higher on the Positive Self Concept scales; and (2) on the post-testing the growth group's Positive Self Concept scale scores equalled and, on three  scales, surpassed those of the control group.

A questionnaire composed of 21 items concerning personal, educational and vocational problems was presented to sophomore and junior students from the following types of high schools: (1) white student body, private, small city, no black teachers or counselors; (2) integrated, urban, black teachers and counselors; (3) rural, all white, no black teachers or counselors; and (4) white, small city, black and white teachers and counselors. Several limitations of the study were outlined and taken into account as indicative of the need for further in-depth research prior to drawing definitive conclusions from the present study. One of  the most critical concerns indicated by the results was the low image students have of counselors as relevant helpers in personal-social problem areas. Of the results discussed, it was strongly suggested that black counselors would be well accepted in all but the rural school. (TL)",

The development of these curves resulted from the investigation of the interrelationships of the variables of creative productivity, college classification, academic potential, sex and perceived anxiety at the university level. The following battery of psychometric tests was given to 233 academically below average and average university students: (1) The American College Testing Program; (2) the IPAT Anxiety Scale Questionnaire; and (3) four of Guilford's tests of divergent production or thinking, specifically, alternate uses, associational fluency, word fluency and consequences.

Two additional studies by Reigal et. al., and Peal and Lambert raise the possibility of bilingualism having some positive relationship to creativity. In this study, an attempt was made to examine the proposition that experience with two languages during childhood is related meaningfully to later verbal creative functioning. Hypotheses were tested on second and fourth graders from a pair of urban elementary schools, one bilingual and one monolingual. Findings included: (1) no significant differences at the second grade level in fluency and flexibility on verbal and figural measures of creativity; and (2) at the fourth grade level,  significant differences between the bilingual and monolingual groups, but not between the sexes. Differences are discussed and tentative conclusions presented. The bilingual experience in childhood was felt to result in subsequent greater development of potential creativity. (TL)",

Current and historical manifestations of the phenomenon are briefly reiterated. The unique need today is for institutionalizing student participation. The students' right to participate in the total life of an instituion is considered basic to the educational experience. The student personnel division is viewed as the primary instrument in effecting this necessary reality. Five specific ways in which the student personnel worker can assist in preparing the  academic community for new forms of student participation are given: (1) calling attention to old, well-institutionalized examples of student participation; (2) drawing attention to local, regional, and national examples of constructive student participation; (3) helping reinstate trust into the academic community; (4) disavowing responsibility for injurious forms of student participation; and (5) becoming involved in areas traditionally outside the scope of student personnel work.

The focus is on opportunity and competence. Along this line, new recruitment programs and Black Studies programs are mentioned. Giving minority students a voice in planning and implementing these programs, as well as including their participation on the administrative councils of schools, is  stressed.

Conclusions reached were that the student and the practitioner should be provided with an opportunity, within a humanistic guidance framework, to learn analysis and interpretation of data in terms of intrinsic values and concepts of what is meaningful to the student. It was assumed that the learner has the right to know what is happening to him and that, therefore, subsequent guidance should be more than a matter of the individual responding to external rewards and punishments which condition his behavior. End results are achieved through media technology in the forms of situational films, videotaping and audiorecording. The films are  based on psycho-social models and themes drawn from theoretical and empirical vocational guidance research. (TL)",

The entire twelfth grade at one high school participated in the study. Ten class sections were assigned to experimental and control groups. Individual teachers had both types of classes. Experimental groups played two games of Consumer, which lasted for six class meetings; control classes had one curriculum unit on consumer use of installment contracts. Two dependent variable measures were developed: one, a test consisting of true/false and multiple choice items; the other, a simulated test of the process of buying a car. There was no significant  difference between simulation and conventional approaches with regard to factual learning. The simulation was more successful in producing credit-comparison shopping behavior on the \"To Buy a Car\" test. The results suggest that simulation games are better able to produce behavioral changes than conventional classroom techniques. (Author)",

Following chapters discuss the compositions of three differential aptitude factors and five specialized knowledge factors, as well as the control factors of sex and grade. Several unsupported hypotheses are set forth including the assertion that abilities are more closely linked to gentics than are motives, and thus have a primacy over motives. Questions are suggested regarding the  predictive validities for life adjustment criteria of the abilities and motives factors.

Undergraduates were subjects and learning material was a series of 32 multiple choice items, with a definition as a stem and four uncommon words as alternatives. Results revealed that superior retention with delayed IF is due to the fact that after a delay subjects acquire more information and when this information can be used on the retention test, retention is facilitated.

It was concluded that among the effects of simulation games, only the differences in the direction of polarization of attitudes were significant.

The findings are derived from analyses of the relationships between the standing of students in grade nine and then in grade 12. Conclusions were that: (1) the amount of growth between grade nine and grade 12 scores is associated with school-taught subjects; (2) the two sexes show different patterns of mental growth; (3) schools affect the performance of students, excluding the differences in individual ability levels; and (4) a sharp distinction between aptitude tests and achievement tests probably does not really exist. Implications  for education are in these areas: (1) the disadvantaged child needs remedial efforts before high school; (2) research needs to be undertaken concerning the academic versus the vocational education issue; and (3) research should focus on the ways effective schools differ from the less effective ones.

        "description":"The deep structure description of a sentence marks the actual grammatical relationships that exist among the words. It is in the deep structure that \"meaning\" is rendered. Two sentences that are marked differently in deep structure might give rise to the same description in surface structure. Three experiments examined the \"psychological reality\" of deep structure variations for sentences of the language. Analyses of a variety of dependent variables from a variety of experimental paradigms with two different populations suggested that deep structure variations produce differential effects in learning and recall. Two experiments with university students using free recall and cued recall paradigms indicated that transitional error probabilities could detect different recall  patterns reflecting the deep structure variations. A third experiment with second grade children revealed that relatively greater facilitation of learning characterized sentences where an integral subject-object relationship could be specified between the paired items in some deep structure form.

Moreover, in one condition the group member providing social support varied over trials. It was predicted that this would result in lower conformity than when only one person repeatedly agreed with the subject. Subjects were 180 female undergraduates who were tested in groups using a Crutchfield kind of apparatus. Results showed that social support, i.e., the presence of a partner answering immediately prior to the subject, significantly reduced conformity on both visual and opinion items. Type of social support was differentially  effective only for opinion items. Generalization of independence from social support to consensual group trials was not obtained. (Author)",

Before students were assigned to groups, they completed a self assessment form on which they rated themselves on 20 behaviors. Teachers from each Unit, using a Consensus method, also evaluated each student on the same set of behaviors. Within each Unit students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: no conferences, individual conferences, small group conferences, or medium group conferences. Teachers encouraged students to define the meaning of behaviors and to pick a behavior or a group of behaviors on which to improve. The child would then set goals for himself. The experimental period lasted 8 weeks. At the end  of the period, another assessment form identical to the initial one was completed by the student and the teachers. Overall behavior rating results indicated that there was a tendency for the students to show greater gains in pre-post ratings than students in the control groups. Students receiving individual conferences gained more than students in small or medium groups. In general, the teacher ratings seemed to change more from pre- to Post-assessment than did student ratings. (Author)",

Among the major findings of the evaluation effort were the generally poor validity ratings for both content and predictive validity, and similarly poor results on the reliability measures (normal technical excellence). The two most conspicuous  findings were: (1) the areas that had almost no (General Activity, Lethargy), or few (Need Achievement and Interest Areas, and Self Esteem) measures available; and (2) the many tests with poor ratings on the first and fourth MEAN criteria.

Results indicated: (1) the amplitude of the visual evoked potential at certain time points following the stimulus is significantly greater for high IQ subjects; and (2) it was shown that there is a tendency for high IQ subjects to have greater energy above 14 cycles in visual evoked responses when compared to low IQ subjects. There is little doubt that study of the electrical activity  of the brain can be related to intellectual functioning and continued research seems justified. (Author/EK)",

The second article discusses the growing pluralism in American universities and suggests that an understanding of the developmental processes of students will provide a basis for the development within the institution of a multiplicity of educational  environments which will enable students to find educational conditions best suited to their potential and intellectual aspirations. The third article is concerned with the student's attainment of a personal identity and proposes that colleges should assist the student in breaking his dependency on parents, developing self reliance, and gaining personal freedom and individuality. The last paper focuses on students' strong reaction to bureaucratic universities and suggests ways to make college more personal. (RSM)",

Briefing is an oral form of communicating specific objectives, tasks, or information with accuracy, brevity, and clarity. In a small case study of Air Force briefing use, the types of briefings were divided according to the direction of flow within the hierarchy--i.e., vertical, horizontal, or radial--and applied to a communication model. Aspects of briefing discussed include the briefer, the project manager, the channel, and the message. Discussion was oriented on how the briefer could organize and plan his briefing accurately. The study concludes that briefing can provide project management with a form of receiving reports that will help maintain a project on  schedule and minimize problems. (Author/MLF)",

System planning at the political level is primarily an explication of the community's long-range goals for education. System planning at the  operational level involves a statement of more explicit objectives and the setting of target dates.

One area of school decision-making that is highly adaptable to quantitative analysis is student transportation. The prevailing manual approach to bus scheduling and routing is time consuming and requires an excessive amount of administrative talent. A more satisfactory method for bus routing that provides optimum service and safety at minimum cost requires man-machine interaction. Under this method, a computer would perform rapidly all the complex mathematical  calculations while allowing for administrator intervention when necessary. Additional benefits that would accrue from computer-designed bus routes include simulation capability for planning, and increased management control. For most school districts, quantitative analysis of operations will require basic changes in staffing and data collection procedures. Increased efficiency in subsequent years should more than offset the high initial costs. (JH)",

These definitions and axioms are used to prove indirectly that programmatic change is compatible with rigorous research. A major conclusion is that research designs are applicable to the structural study of organization and that they permit a study of the managers' reactions to feedback in a real world situation. The use of research designs will thus permit the establishment of a causal theory of management and organizations. (Author/LLR)",

Findings over 3 years indicated that language age growth accelerated while performance age and nonverbal mental age remained linear. Also, ability to use amplification from the wearable hearing aid improved, with an improved mean threshold response to spoken voice of more than 20 dB. The parents mobilized themselves into pressure groups resulting in legislation for education of  deaf preschoolers. Community approval of the project resulted in continuance of its services after federal funding ceased. (Author/JD)",

These associations remained significant when chronological age was controlled. Also, both interjudge agreement and test reliability met levels established in previous studies of intellectually normal individuals. It was concluded, therefore, that the revised RTT was both reliable and valid with the retarded and provided a basis for study of the relationship between role taking ability and behavioral indices of social adequacy.

The samples were then subjected to error, quantitative, and transformational analysis. Findings suggested a relationship between the order in which the deaf child acquires the rules of his language and the ordering of rules in a theoretical description of the generative process, with rules occurring early in the generative process generally being acquired earlier than rules occurring later. Furthermore, the order in which the deaf child acquired rules seemed similar to that observed in much younger hearing children. In the early stages of language development both hearing and deaf children reduced the frequency of errors in their writing more quickly than in later  stages. Other findings suggested that, although the levels of performance of deaf and hearing differed markedly, differences in rate of development were not great. (Author/JD)",

Furthermore such a system would not teach a student to interact effectively with other humans, to communicate the results of his labors to others, or to exchange ideas in attempts to solve shared problems. For the present, the computer is most useful in its role of a general purpose information processing system. Individualized instruction allows the mode, content and sequence of instruction to be tailored to the individual's needs at any moment in time. A computer is an important tool in individualizing instruction. The computer can be used as a teaching machine, a problem solving  tool, or as a tutorial system.

This paper suggests some of the possible reasons for the lack of utilization of educational films. The author points out the advantages of films in classroom use, especially in the context of a systems approach to education. He discusses some of the work the Eastman Kodak Company has done in developing films for educational use. He also offers suggestions for ways in which to foster the use of films in the classroom.

Eight-millimeter film has the potential to lower the cost of films, making them more accessible, and to make showing them vastly simpler. This paper traces the development of 8mm film use in education, noting the various factors which have militated against the full use of the format's possibilities in education. The author describes the state of 8mm educational film and projector as it stands today and points out the potential for local production of films.

He predicts that in the future instructional television will be mainly carried by closed circuit transmissions, possibly augmented by community antenna television systems (CATV). Other developments will probably include a Federally supported public television, use of satellite transmission by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and a nationwide linkage of CATV systems. He bases his predictions on a survey of the present state of educational television, federal legislation on broadcasting, and the technological  innovations which are just beginning to be used in commercial television.

DAIRS represents the combination of two long established communications techniques--magnetic tape recording and replay devices and telephone dialing switching devices. Only a handful of DAIRS installations offer the random access feature, as the technology for this is both primitive and expensive. Variable video access is also still in the developmental stage. The future will probably bring a combination of the various attributes of a DAIRS system related to multi-branching systems of logic in computer assisted  programed instruction. Many schools are already experimenting with one form or another of a DAIRS system, but before the full potential of this or any other technological innovation may be realized a thorough analysis of educational objectives and procedures is in order.

In the interface between education and programing there are serious weaknesses in the design of materials, severe problems in the economics of design and use, and an almost insurmountable gulf between the philosophy or point of view on which programing is based and the present thinking of most school systems. Two areas in which the technology needs further development are in the analysis of the structure of knowledge and in the approach to cross-curricular skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and inference techniques. The unnecessary duplication of effort which is common in programing instruction today has led to a waste of financial and human resources. There  seems to be a philosophical conflict between the empirical approach of the adherents of programed instruction and the idealism of the process-oriented educational philosophers. (Author/JY)",

        "description":"The development of new technology for education raises the question of control. Large corporations have entered the education field. They view the reluctance of some educators to commit themselves to the new media as a sign of fear of change. Educators who hold humanistic views of the learning process criticize the regimentation and regulation necessary to the new technology. Certain factors inherent in the educational system tend to prevent a take-over by the educational business technologists, but these same factors do not also assure the adequate assessment of materials to insure the use of the many valuable aids which are being developed. An independent \"consumer's union\" would be a valuable aid in evaluating some of the potentially revolutionary techniques; so would more  adequate teacher training in the philosophy of various technologies. In-service training, which has long been an under-valued tool, could help to up grade the knowledge of present teachers about educational technology and thus made them more able to evaluate techniques for their own use.

But examination of studies of these children has proved that some of the assumptions about them have been false and that instructional technology may, in fact, be a hindrance. There is no proof that slum children are good at motor tasks and poor at conceptual learning. Disadvantaged children are more dependent on the approval of their teacher than are middle-class children who receive adequate praise for academic achievement at home. Placing any mechanical barrier between the disadvantaged child and the teacher is likely to slow his development.

In order to maximize the cost effectiveness of a given technology, it may be better to have a constant interplay between people familiar with educational problems, educational research, hardware technologies, and production and development costs, so that it will be possible to make intelligent trade-offs among various alternative approaches. Educational users should also be represented on all appropriate industrial standardization committees and should agree to specify that all equipment they order must be in compliance with the standardization recommendations of these committees, unless there is some urgent educational reason for  deviating.

The challenge for instructional technology, as for education in general, is to devise an approach to education that aims at the growth of the students, not of test scores. Its aim should be to make education a democratic process wherein students learn by doing, and learning is closely allied to the working and needs of the community, and the needs of the students. The use of technology in the Philadelphia Parkway program is a major move in the right direction.

The structured response test, requiring 15 minutes to administer, yields a profile of group performance in the production of standard grammatical (word formation and word order) and phonological features in English. The test consists of 43 items which refer to three pictures. The group score indicates which features of the language are most troublesome for a particular group of students. The conceptual oral language test (COLT) is used with pupils in the primary block who are low achievers because of inadequate control of standard English. The COLT is designed  to assess the pupil's ability to solve problems and talk about basic concepts in mathematics, science, and social sciences. This test consists of 60 items divided into four formats: differentiation, classification, seriation, and analogy. Test administration requires approximately 35 minutes. Assessment of instructional programs for bilingual and non-standard English speakers is facilitated through the evaluation of the results of this test. (RL)",

The formal correspondence and records of the VPAA's office were screened to identify decisions regarding innovations in that office over a period of one year. The 72 innovations thus identified were then classified by: (1) disposition, (2) source of entry into the university, and (3) source through which the VPAA learned of the innovation. Ten innovations were selected for case study. This paper deals primarily with the characteristics of the VPAA's role in the following stages of the decision-making process: (1) knowledge-stimulation, (2) interest-initiation, (3) attitude  change-legitimation, (4) collective or individual decision, and (5) implementation. The indications were that the VPAA's role in collective decisions was more oriented toward educational nuturance, and in individual decisions, was more related to policy and finance checking. The VPAA was more likely to be an initiator, legitimizer and decision maker, than stimulator or implementer. Most innovations enter the university through constituents of the academic community, and there seemed to be little effort to implement innovations by replacing existing programs. (AF)",

The Coleman study clearly documented the problem of educational deprivation; Katz, Berger, and others have analyzed the conditions that create educational deprivation; and Gordon and Wilkerson, and Egerton have surveyed experimental and compensatory programs for students with deficient pre-college background. The surveys indicated that relatively few institutions have compensatory programs and that only a small number of disadvantaged students are reached. Though many of these programs are commendable, there seems  to be a general neglect of the non-black minorities, systematic evaluation of the programs is almost nonexistent, and most programs are created without knowledge of similar programs elsewhere. In planning a compensatory program, institutions should first assess their ability to cope with disadvantaged students, establish realistic objectives, and allocate adequate funds. The ideal program should include: a recruitment program; a summer preparatory program; a special services program; and student financial aid. A system for evaluating program effectiveness must also be incorporated. (AF)",

Questionnaires were sent to 2280 persons. Of 1096 responses, 140 persons, or 12.7% were 60 or older, and 102 or 9.4% were under 35 years of age. A greater percentage of men and women earned their degree between the ages of 35-39 than during any other five year span. The majority received their undergraduate training at black colleges. More than 70% required ten years or more to obtain the doctorate. More than half the degrees earned were in education and the social sciences. 85.4% were employed by colleges and universities, overwhelmingly in black institutions. A recent survey of the PhDs awarded from 1964 through 1968 at 63 graduate  schools indicated that only 294 or .8% of the 37,456 degrees were awarded to black Americans. The demand for black PhDs is rapidly increasing and several programs have been organized to help blacks in obtaining the doctorate. The Ford Foundation has instituted a fellowship program for blacks interested in a college teaching career. It is also assisting faculty members at predominantly black colleges who are participating in advanced study programs. It is hoped that by 1973, almost 2% rather than the present 1% of all American PhDs will be black. (AF)",

There is strong pressure on the student to finish college in four years, or to continue immediately with graduate study. For a healthier voluntary campus atmosphere, prestigious employers could arrange with universities to have talented seniors return to the campus anytime within ten years after graduation. The &quot;manipulated society&quot; refers to a deeply rooted malaise in this country, which traditionally has  been a haven for those with economic, political or opinion intiatives. This country now seems more manipulated than free, more closed than open. Economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few, as is the opinion industry of national networks and the strong newspapers. The political market is now increasingly dominated by the concentration of self-perpetuating power. To regain an open society, it is essential that these power centers be opened so that all will have a chance to participate. (AF)",

        "description":"Few publications on interinstitutional cooperation go beyond a description, generally a glowing one, of individual programs and activities. Yet many problems beset an effort of formalized cooperation. (1) There is often a great difference between \"cooperation\" as an abstraction and \"cooperation\" as a practical reality. The mere formalization of a cooperative center does not lead automatically to cooperative behavior on the part of the participants. (2) For each consortium created, the primary orientation of faculty, administration, and students will remain toward the home institution. (3) Unrealistic expectations for the consortium often lead to frustration. (4) An early \"search for identity\" is common for most consortia, and actual programs may be slow to start. (5) It is  difficult for a consortium to draw up rational long-range plans or suitable programs if its members are unwilling or unable to construct their own plans, or unwilling to share in the consortium plans. (6) Creating a consortium does not lead to automatic financial support. Recognizing their limitations, consortia should nevertheless seek institutional change, revitalization and administrative efficiency. (AF)",

        "description":"In the past 15 years, there has been a great upsurge in interinstitutional cooperation, a momentum which will probably increase in the next 15 years. In order to find answers to some basic questions affecting consortia, the Midwest Association for Higher Education (MAHE)-a pseudonym-was studied. This paper deals primarily with the question: what conflicts arise as interdependency increases and how are these conflicts managed in such a way as to preserve the interinstitutional character of the consortium? Conflict in MAHE was directly primarily toward the central office, and to some extent toward other colleges in the cooperative. The specific conflicts seemed to center around four central problem areas: (1) the role and scope of the central office; (2) the distribution of limited  resources; (3) the heterogeneity of member institutions attempting to seek common goals; and (4) administrative procedures and management as the consortium developed. The four mechanisms used for resolving conflict between the colleges and the central office were: (1) a clear division of labor; (2) a system of checks and balances; (3) formation of coalitions; and (4) a philosophical ethos of voluntarism. Since conflict will inevitably arise in any kind of cooperative effort, it is vital to learn to deal with it constructively. (AF)",

Sixty-four impulsive entering freshmen with SAT scores of 1000 or more were assigned in equal numbers to one of four conditions: (1) paid counseling--students were paid a weekly amount, contingent upon their attending a weekly group counseling session; (2) paid math--students were paid weekly amount, contingent upon their demonstrating that they had completed their previous week's mathematics assignment; (3) paid control--students were paid a weekly amount with no contingent effort required; and (4) unpaid control--no direct interventions were attempted beyond an initial testing for impulsivity prior to the beginning of the semester.  Sixty-four non-impulsive entering freshmen served as additional controls in each of the four conditions. The main results were that weekly counseling significantly improved the final grades of the impulsive students. Paying students to study mathematics was only effective among impulsive students with SAT scores of 1060 or more. Among this group, final grades were significantly improved in comparison to the grades of the control group. (Author)",

Several studies have pointed out that under ordinary conditions, ruling &quot;elites&quot; take over faculty affairs, and participation on senate committees is limited to a relatively small number of faculty. The faculty is often distrustful of the administration and joint participation on committees does not necessarily relieve the tension. Decentralization of decision making and authority, however, does seem to be a useful devise in reducing conflict. The methods used in resolving conflict closely relate to the power struggle. The division is between the principle of shared  decision making and shared authority in a community with common interests as exemplified by the AAUP, and the assumption of permanent conflict of interest between faculty and administration requiring confrontation, sanctions, and collective bargaining, as propounded by the AFT. Another issue is the composition of governing boards which are now primarily composed of lay members. The time has come to broaden the representation on the boards, to include faculty members and students, and increase the opportunities for discussion. (AF)",

Work is deemphasized and fulfillment stressed; joy is substituted for guilt. The campus has, however, not moved an iota toward this new ethic, and much of student protest revolves around that. During the next decade, the number of adversary situations in governance will probably increase, and factional struggles for power and control of the university may ruin it. The great public institutions which enroll an ever greater number of students, have reported significant increases in student unrest, and because of their size, will continue to be vulnerable to disruption. Existing institutions must be selectively decentralized so that  their governance systems can be both small and large simultaneously: decisions affecting individual lives and commitments should be made in the smallest possible units, while matters of logistics and support services should be decided in the largest context available, tapping into national networks.

Their objective is to defuse explosive student attitudes stemming from irritation with the institution by providing, in addition to the normal channels of assistance and redress, an independent faculty member who personally receives individual grievances and, if he believes they have merit, seeks immediate relief. To assess the effectiveness and implications of this new position, 6 campus ombudsmen were interviewed and more than 200 students who consulted an ombudsman at Michigan State University were surveyed. Both academic and nonacademic problems were brought to the ombudsman. Nearly half the  students had taken their problems to others in authority first. Two out of three students said that their grievances were at least partially solved after taking them to the ombudsman, and all thought that the position should be continued. To be effective, an ombudsman must know the institution and have the respect of the faculty, students and administration. A list of 18 features that appear to be basic to the successful operation of the office is included. (AF)",

Though increased participation has met with some success, it is by no means the major reform in governance that is needed to make academic institutions more responsive to current needs. Student representation has not really been representative of the student body; the membership of governing bodies has been changed, but the nature and function of the university has not been defined. Perhaps, instead of ignoring the students, the university has traditionally been too protective of students. The time has come for the university to  withdraw as completely as possible from all nonacademic areas of student life and welfare, and transfer responsibility to the students themselves. If the university abandons some of its welfare state role, it may be able to concentrate more on learning and teaching or possibly extending educational opportunity more widely. And in rethinking its welfare function, the university should not only think of the students, but of the greater needs of the whole community. (AF)",

These changes tend to reflect more accurately the actual conditions of power and authority on campus. Whereas the issue of student and faculty participation in decision making has been extensively explored, the roles of the president, his associates, and the board of trustees have been largely ignored. If boards of trustees were eliminated, as  some have suggested, external groups would gain further power over collegiate institutions, and the parochialism and self-interest so often manifested by faculty and students would increase and conflict with external forces. Boards of trustees should become more representative of diverse social and economic groups and better informed about their institutions.

Efforts by administrators and faculty to meet some of the students' demands may account for the lessening of violence on campus. Responsibility for orderly progress does not lie with the students alone; Congress has to bear much of it. The federal government has assumed an important share of higher education costs, and many congressmen feel that some strings should be attached to this aid. Expenditures for higher education will be subject to increasing questioning in the years to come. Decisions will have to be made  about the relative emphasis to be given to student aid and institutional aid, and whether, in the latter case, the formula grant approach or the categorical grant system should be used. Questions of raising tuition at state schools to approximate more closely the full costs of tuition and the distribution of state grants based on need must also be considered.

Some of these boards are control boards to which presidents report and through which institutional budgets are actually determined. These boards do limit institutional autonomy. Still more numerous, but losing in popularity, are the coordinating boards which have some degree of carefully moderated authority over some functions of higher education, but no real control over personnel and budgets, thus limiting the effect on institutional autonomy. In order for central boards to be effective, they must engage in master planning, give  attention to the role of institutions, and develop criteria for establishing new ones. It is likely that the coordinating board, despite the fact it is the best arrangement, will give way to the central control board for three basic reasons: (1) the difficulty in recruiting and retaining truly qualified and dedicated lay members on the coordinating board; (2) the problems of keeping the coordinating board divorced from politics; and (3) the unwillingness of university administrators and trustees to accept coordinating board decisions.

The Committee proposed that a new position of Dean of General Education be established, who have charge of a budget, and the authority to create an undergraduate curriculum. The Dean and the General Education Council, composed of faculty from the university at large, decided that English Composition was the only course absolutely necessary for each undergraduate. Five area requirements were created from which students could choose 4. Students were allowed to receive up to 48 hours of  credit for passing standardized examinations.

(5) Activists' disdain for \"Scientific Man\" is stimulating efforts to restore MAN as the subject of basic study and concern. (6) Activism has sharpened the  political and social awareness of college and high school students. Two negative effects of activism have been the growing belief that destruction and violence are legitimate as long as they proceed from a personal commitment to a \"just\" cause, and the fanning of already present tendencies to repress free inquiry and expression.

It is also unlikely that many of those who enter a junior college will end up in a senior institution. In addition the college-age growth rate will decline in the late seventies and eighties. The greatest strain will be felt in the graduate  schools and by young teaching aspirants receiving their doctorate: there will be less and less demand for their services. This may have the beneficial effect of increasing faculty stability and interest in teaching, of decompressing academic salary scales, and of giving new institutions an opportunity to attract better young faculty and develop quality programs.

Among the proposed models are: (1) the experimental model - universities without walls, or the city as university; (2) the university whose main objective is \"relevance\"; (3) the university that provides education for leisure; (4) the university as a shelter for part of the population;  (5) the university as producer of people who can make things work; (6) the university as a training ground for survival. The university can be considered a self-service supermarket with an inspection station at the end, or as a factory or processing plant. If alternative models are considered, nothing must be assumed as inherently virtuous or corrupt. (AF)",

Collective bargaining has at least three positive aspects. (1) It is the most effective means yet to emerge from within a democratic society to effect the resolution of differences of opinion between employer and employee concerning matters of common interest. (2) It is the procedure most likely to produce mutually satisfactory agreements when employed in good faith. (3) It creates at least the potential for a balance of power situation in which differences can be more equitably resolved. The agenda and scope of collective bargaining tends to determine itself while the experience is in process, but there is great need for understanding the possibilities and  limitations of the process. The emergence of a hierarchy within the administration, with a concomitant development of varying levels of status, and the resulting bureaucracy is probably the principal cause behind the rise of collective bargaining.

It was assumed that urban crises have created new imperatives for all urban universities and urban universities face pressures from both acknowledged and unacknowledged constituencies. Chapter 1 describes the selection of 11 urban universities to participate in the study and sketches their efforts to become more involved in urban problems. Chapter 2 examines demands on the university by the surrounding community, militant students, city officials and activist faculty. Chapter 3 examines expectations of urban universities from a historical perspective. Chapter 4 posits a pattern of faculty  behavior emerging from the historical conflicts. Chapter 5 returns to the demands in Chapter 2 and tests them against the picture developed in Chapters 3 and 4 on university response. Chapter 6, based on a 3-day conference designed to bring together constituency representatives and others committed to change in urban universities, looks at the problem of building effective coalitions. Communication problems proved so enormous that the task of creating networks of communication in individual cities became the first step. The report ends with a description of one university's attempt to create mechanisms for real communication among diverse viewpoints. (JS)",

In the near future, the current cognitive emphasis of the program will be altered to include more attitudinal measures like a vocational interest inventory and an assessment of educational, employment, and life goals. In addition, the Program's ability to provide guidance and placement information will be increased by adding measures similar to those found in the U.S. Employment Service General Aptitude Test Battery. Eventually, the test will permit the making of institutional and academic program &quot;type&quot; decisions based on results of a junior year examination. Optional advanced credit examinations permitting better reflection of pre-college educational  experience are also planned. Finally, the need to develop and incorporate non-intellective predictors of junior college performance and experience in guidance programs is discussed. While existing examinations, such as those in the Washington Testing Program, can accurately predict an individual's graded success, they are not currently capable of predicting one's personal growth, and immediate or long-range feelings of satisfaction concerning his college experiences. Recent efforts to discover criteria influencing these predictors indicate that one way to alleviate negative results is to provide some overlap between predictors and criteria. (JO)",

Clark's &quot;cooling out&quot; process--a process designed to encourage students to match their levels of aspiration with their abilities and interests--by changing to an alternate major. Using a sample of 1000 Cerritos College (California) students, the following results are noted: (1) students on probation and those doing passing work showed no significant differences in frequency of major change; (2) only one-third of the students initially selecting a transfer major changed to a terminal major after being placed on probation; (3) almost as many probationary terminal and transfer students changed to a more difficult major as selected an easier one, with the majority  failing to change majors at all; and (4) the proportion of students seeking terminal majors declined over time. This reluctance of students to accept more realistic goals is seen as a major cause of high attrition rates and failures to earn Associate of Arts and Vocational degrees in the junior colleges. Probable causes of this reaction, according to existing research, include family and social pressures, the student's preconceived association of certain levels of prestige with different majors, and ineffective remedial instruction and guidance programs.

After the groups were compared according to race and ability for data-collecting purposes, pre- and post-test measurements were taken of reading vocabulary, reading comprehension, and speed of reading comprehension. Different forms of the Cooperative English Test--College Level were used for pre- and post-testing, and analysis of variance was used to identify statistical differences. Results showed significant improvements made by the group as a whole in each area. In addition, no significant statistical differences were noted in gains made by either sub-group in any  area. Finally, 55 per cent of the black students and 72 per cent of the white students successfully achieved the 25th percentile rank in comprehension and speed (considered minimum for college-level reading).

The program, offered during a student's initial semester of attendance, is designed to help potentially low academic achievers succeed in college. Using random selection techniques, students were chosen from first-time enrollees who had no prior college experience and who had standard English scores of 10 or less on the American College Tests. Students were then randomly assigned to groups. The experimental groups contained 122 students who enrolled in the General Studies Program; the control groups consisted of 128 students not in the program. Sex and ethnic subgroups were formed from the principal study groups. The criteria for the study were: college persistence rate, course  attrition rate, and grade point average. Performance of the study groups and subgroups was evaluated for four consecutive semesters. Tests for significant differences included adjustments for small samples and for continuity. Completion of the General Studies Program encouraged males and minority students to re-enroll for a second semester. Minority students who enrolled in the Program dropped fewer units for the first semester than minority students who did not enroll in it. There were no other statistically significant differences that could be attributed to the Program. (Author/JO)",

These centralized agencies can assist in reducing unnecessary competition and duplication among junior colleges, and can improve the coordination of statewide educational needs with those of the individual institution. In developing a productive relationship between the coordinating agency and the junior colleges, some of the more important considerations are: precise definition of coordinating agency role and authority, recognition of mutual interdependence, and standardization of actions. Guidelines by which the agency staff operates in coordinating and implementing activities with the junior colleges can be seen as authority placement,  institutional autonomy, institution-agency cooperation, and institution-agency conflict. Councils of institutional representatives improve the coordinating process by serving as forums providing feedback from the college to the coordinating agency. In conclusion, central agency practices that could insure coordination of the cooperative system and maximum feasible institutional autonomy include the development of a master program plan, a uniform accounting manual, and agreements with other institutions of higher education.

With this in mind, the author discusses the nature and requirements of such cooperation. For example, the chief functions of a state director could include promoting the junior college program, providing leadership for its planning and development, and coordinating state-wide junior college research. This would require placing greater emphasis on planning and coordination than on supervision and regulation. Establishment of the director's role could involve such items as definition of the nature and function of the position, subsequent delegation of necessary implementing authority, and insulation of the position from partisan political influence. The  functions of Florida's state director in his role as Assistant Commissioner of Education and as Executive Officer of the State Junior College Board provide a current example.

A survey of current research and of the responses to questionnaires by administrators, counselors, department heads, and transfer students reveals the interface between junior college programs and those at the senior institutions. Finally, a Work-Study Conference of individuals with experience in this field developed  a Guideline Bulletin (see appendix) that discusses the teacher shortage problem, facilitation of transfer, current and future institutional requirements, and problems faced by the transfer student. Concurrently developed are two teacher preparation programs that emphasize the interface between the junior college and the senior institution: (1) the Partnership Program, designed for students who have already decided to become industrial education teachers even before entering the junior college; and, (2) the Pyramid Program, designed for those who decide to teach while in junior college or before entering a transfer institution.

Seven basic dimensions of data base design are: (1) data base life span, (2) logical record growth, (3) record content growth, (4) data set organization, (5) linkages, (6) design criteria and (7) modeling and the data base. The approach utilized is to introduce the broad concepts concerned with data base design techniques and to focus on practical file management software examples. Data base examples are utilized from MARK IV, Informatics Inc. and Retrieval Analysis and Presentation System (RAPS), Leasco Systems and Research Corporation. Broader managerial implications are introduced as a determinant set of conditions that affect data  base size and growth. Economies of technological scale are a function of various factors such as the selected file management software system, the data base size, and the computer processing/communication environment. Recognizing the tradition of gradually integrating files into the future common data base structure of tomorrow's management information systems, data base design technology is introduced at the individual file level. Common data base development consolidation and integration can be achieved by extending the basic concepts that are presented. (Author/MF)",

The techniques and concepts presented are now being implemented by major organizations in the development of Management Information Systems (MIS). A marketing data base in this presentation is considered to be a logical or conceptual data base which does not exist as a physical entity in one segment of the corporate MIS, but, rather, exists as a logical set of data that can be located by a software &quot;definition table.&quot; Other data bases can utilize any appropriate elements from the corporate MIS. A definition table defines each data base within the MIS. The concept developed here relies upon the  ability to utilize one common data base as several data bases through the process of software manipulation, this serves as the corporate MIS and is updated in a unified manner. The advantages are seen in terms of file maintenance, time and storage requirements. (NH)",

To accomplish these objectives, 167 reference work annotations and 850 questions dealing with these tools were compiled and organized into a linear program.

A TWX experiment linking two union catalogs and the State Library is described. In a 172 day period (Feb.-Oct. 1969), 4502 requests (estimated as 44% or less of the current potential volume) entered the system. Of these, 2318 (52%) were found at the first station, 427 (10%) at the second station, and the remaining 38% were unlocated. 539 titles (12%) were located as a result of the connection. Of the 1719 not located, 413 were new publications outside the interlibrary loan code recognized by the union catalogs, and 996 were not identified in 3 bibliographic sources with indications that they were incorrect entries or material outside the  scope of the catalogs. The report suggests that 87% of the \"proper\" requests could be located in Ohio libraries. The mean number of days items were in the system was 2.61, with a range of 1-13.

When anger erupts in a classroom, it may be the result of cultural conditions that produce frustration and tension or adult-caused frustrations that could be avoided, such as rigid rules or lack of respect for the child. In discussing the characteristics of anger, the author stresses that anger may not be consciously recognized by the sufferer and that anger is cumulative and may suddenly &quot;explode.&quot; The degrees of anger are discussed, and descriptions of anger's physiological effects are given. Guidelines are given for teachers and schools to follow in working with troubled children. Included are case descriptions of two children who were severe classroom problems. The point of view emphasized is  that the origins of a child's anger must be understood intellectually to effectively plan strategy needed to help the child. A flexible approach to treatment, involving the child on both the cognitive and emotional level, is urged. A nonjudgmental, patient, and humanitarian approach is stressed in handling anger in children. (DR)",

The tests included the Peabody, the Caldwell, the \"C\" Test, and the Categories Test. Though the tests have a very limited value for evaluating the effectiveness of the program at this time, the results seem to indicate the NNS is affecting children's behavior in a desired direction. Section two, a follow-up study of children who previously attended the schools, used standard tests, such as the Stanford-Binet, and  teacher ratings. The tests tend to show that old NNS students are performing at least satisfactorily in their grade. The teacher ratings, however, correlate poorly with more objective measures and lead to the unfortunate conclusion that teachers are still prejudging children as poor-learning stereotypes. The final section reports on the usefulness of the \"typing booth,\" a facility at the NNS. (MH)",

The following points are made: (1) evaluations should be planned at the time the program is planned and this was not the case with the Westinghouse Report, and (2) an evaluation program should measure the factors the educational program intended to improve. While the Westinghouse Report measured such factors as language development, learning readiness, and achievement, the objectives of Head Start are much broader and involve health, social, and emotional needs. Further, the report didn't test children right after they completed Head Start, but waited to see if learning gains were maintained a full year later. Since Head Start is a community  program, it differs from one town to another in goals and methods and therefore can't be evaluated on a national basis. (MH)",

To reduce the tendency of evaluators to inflate scores, the test was administered by both the mother and teacher of each child. Attainment Ages (AA) and Attainment Quotients (AQ) were determined for each child, and these scores were compared for similarity of parent and teacher evaluations. Comparison of AQ scores showed that parents scored boys higher than teachers did, but there were no differences in judgments of girls' developmental levels.

While PROSE was invented for a specific project involving 2000 4-year-old ghetto children, its general applicability has already become apparent. PROSE represents a primitive method of classroom observation since it does not provide an observer rating type of classroom record. PROSE strives to eliminate observer subjectivity by requiring only the objective recording of observable events. The record is also personal since the observer only watches one child at a time and records all his activity. PROSE is thus similar to ecological studies, except that the child's record is coded in the classroom rather than from a later review of  films and recordings taken in class. The in-class coding is made possible by the PROSE &quot;language,&quot; based on 11 word statements that can be fed directly to the computer. Static conditions, such as subject matter, class organization, and instructional materials are also recorded. The 11 word statements used by the observer code all aspects of the particular students's current activity, including level of attention, physical activity, and manifest affect. (MH)",

In attempting to answer these questions, subjects from grade one through grade 13 were shown 15 pairs of random polygons, the alternatives differing in level of complexity, and asked to select the alternative they \"liked,\"\"found more pleasing,\" or \"found more interesting.\" Analysis of the number of \"more complex\" (defined in terms of number of sides)  selections made by each grade and response group suggested that complex stimuli were considered to be more interesting than either pleasing or likeable. There was also a significant decrease in liking for more complex stimulation with age. Results were interpreted as supporting research which has argued that the verbal evaluations of \"like,\"\"interesting,\" and \"pleasing\" are not synonymous although related, and findings that positive evaluation of complexity decreases with age.

        "description":"The Echoic Response Inventory for Children (ERIC) is part of a test battery which includes the Expressive Vocabulary Inventory (EVI) and the Children's Auditory Discrimination Inventory (CADI), designed to assess language skills of disadvantaged children. These tests also seek to provide data that can help determine what changes in language performance may be attributed to replicable types of instructional programs. Performance on the ERIC represents a composite measure of auditory perception, verbal output, range of sentence memory, and accuracy of phonemic reproduction. Thus, it should provide a good basis for deciding whether a child is ready to begin reading. The ERIC consists of a series of 20 sentences, arranged in order of increasing difficulty. Children hear the sentences  one at a time and are asked to repeat them. They receive a score of either &quot;credit&quot; (1 or no mistakes) or &quot;no credit&quot; (2 or more mistakes). The ERIC was tested on 450 preschool children of varying sex, age, race, and socioeconomic status to see if any of these variables affected test performance. Analysis of variance treatment of results showed that main effects were found for age and SES, but not for race or sex. The instrument was found to be a useful tool for assessing a child's level of readiness for beginning reading instruction. (MH/Author)",

Four-year-olds smiled more when alone than 6-year-olds who smiled most when in the group situation. The two groups gave different responses in rating stimuli as humorous. Humor responses and ratings were not correlated. In the second study, 48 4- and 6-year-old boys, in groups of three, listened to two audio tapes which contained essentially nonverbal humorous and  nonhumorous stimuli. On one tape the third stimulus was followed by 10 seconds of silence, on the second tape by 5 seconds of laughter and 5 of silence. Videotapes showed that 6-year-olds laughed and smiled with the laugh track more than 4-year-olds. Laughter and smiling were significantly related at age 4 but not at age 6.

Conservation of number, which represents a subset within the concept of conservation, was measured by use of a 20-item, criterion-referenced testing device. The subjects, who were tested 3 years in succession during a 4-week period each spring, were 5, 6, and 7 years of age (at the time of the last data collection). The factor analysis of the test results revealed a pattern of development that showed an increasing emergence of the conservation factor. Furthermore, successive factor analyses indicated that this conservation factor has its roots in related subskills, particularly vocabulary discrimination. The  overall developmental pattern, as shown by this analysis, moves from diffuseness toward increasing organization as the subskills develop and conservation emerges. These results are seen as support for Piaget's theoretical notion of the emergency of conservation. (MH)",

Eight half-hour observations are planned for each child. Mealtime was chosen as the situational setting, but sampling has been difficult since some lower income families do not have organized meals. This general lack of scheduling or temporal patterning is one of the environmental factors affecting children's development; a second one is the behavioral inconsistency of the  adults around children. The qualitative aspects of mothers' behavior and the frequency of unpredictable behavior towards the child are to be examined in this study. The pilot study of five teachers of culturally deprived 5-year-olds, involves gathering half-hour specimen records of teacher behavior in two classroom settings. Teacher behavior will then be divided into episodes (identifiable goal-directed actions). The long range study goal is to find clues on how to select teachers and help them act as constructive agents in the child's environment. (NH)",

Behavior is emotional when it varies from an individual's behavioral baseline by the addition of three components: (1) an action component, (2) an arousal component, and (3) a subjective \"feeling\" component. In all areas of infantile emotion researchers have attempted to delineate such basic groundwork as \"primitive, unlearned emotions,\" but subsequent study has indicated that their conclusions are more the result of situational and subjective factors than of measurable, objective data. Infant emotions are divided into negative and positive categories in this paper. Discussion of specific emotions includes fear of strangers and maternal attachment,  other fears and anxiety. A broad developmental outline of responses to fear-inducing stimuli is given. Other negative emotions, such as anger, depression, and shame are discussed. The paper also outlines some of the work that has been done with positive emotions and concludes with comments on the functional significance of emotions in early development. (MH)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the meaning of environmental deprivation, specifically the effects of racial, ethnic, and cultural differences on education. Objectives are also given for a Head Start and Follow Through program. A child is environmentally deprived to the extent that he has not developed his intellectual ability and a positive self-image. Environmental deprivation is often caused by a limited quantity and poor quality of interaction between a child and adults, particularly his parents. The quality and the amount of interaction are reduced by conditions prevalent in poor homes: (1) parents' low educational achievement, (2) absence of the father in the home, (3) a large family, (4) a crowded home, (5) a high rate of physical and mental illness, and (6) a parental attitude of  psychological defeat. All of these factors contribute to limited intellectual development and a negative self-concept. Because schools are oriented to the white middle class, they fail to respond to the life style, values, and culture of minority group children. Head Start and Follow Through should respond to minority groups and focus on developing sensory and perceptual acuity, concept formation and problem solving ability, and language competence. Home involvement is also needed. Programs should respond to the child's needs and involve the family in a meaningful way. (DR)",

Study subjects, 15 infants, approximately 1 month old, had 2 patterns (colorful mobiles of yarn, match boxes or paper umbrellas) introduced above their cribs when they were 4-5 weeks of age. One of these patterns was stable and one was set up to be responsive to the infants'  movements, but variation in size and mobility of cribs in the various homes made data relating to the second hypothesis invalid. After the infants had had 4 weeks of familiarization with the patterns, observers tested them twice for attentional preference, with a third, unfamiliar pattern added above the crib. Another period of 4 weeks was followed by a final test. Results indicated initial attentional preference for familiar patterns, followed by preference for unfamiliar patterns after the additional period. (MH)",

Attentional preference was determined by a Rustrak event-recorder instead of the stopwatch used in the previous study. Reliability was also assured in this study by having two experienced examiners  record looking times independently during a portion of the test. At 2 months of age, the infants were tested with the now-familiar pattern presented simultaneously with an unfamiliar one. Similar tests were made when the infants were 2 1/2 and 3 months old. At 3 1/4 months a new stimulus pattern was introduced for familiarization. Finally, at 3 1/2 months the newly-familiar pattern was tested against an unfamiliar one.

The issues are: (1) the serious shortage of day care for children of working mothers, (2) rapidly increasing evidence that intervention must begin before the age of 3, if the poverty cycle is to be broken, (3) a need for comprehensive, continuous health and education services for children, preferably in the same physical location (perhaps at a Children's Center) for consistency of care and lowered costs, (4) parent involvement in areas of program development and parent education, (5) the need for trained manpower to establish and supervise day care and early education programs, and (6) the urgent need of children for powerful political and professional advocates. HR 13520 is  valuable because it would make funds available for day care services, but it should be changed to include children under 3. The bill contains the potential for development of comprehensive child care programs including health, nutritions and social services and daily programs. However, the bill should either (1) detail what these services should include and how they would be coordinated, or (2) provide an administrative mechanism with authority to develop service models, standards, coordinating mechanisms, and quality control methods. If passed, a strong professional advocate to administer the program is essential. The Office of Child Development is suggested as the best agency at present to act in this capacity, but its authority and responsibilities need to be strengthened and expanded.  (Author/NH)",

Misunderstanding of the resulting conflict led to such ethnocentric and culturally chauvinistic explanations as the \"cultural deprivation\" of blacks and Puerto Ricans. Though we claim to have moved beyond this point of misunderstanding now, we have yet to solve the problem of the child who must not only learn to read and write a different language or dialect than he hears and speaks outside the  school, but must also do so through situations and procedures that are culturally foreign to his experience.

The pilot study of this project, whose main objective was the adaptation of measures of developmental parameters to the unique needs of India, was reported to PS 003 284. The present document reproduces a study that attempts to validate the findings of a cross-sectional study of Indian developmental norms by comparing results (only in the area of personal-social development) with the data from a longitudinal study. The sample for the cross-sectional study was a group of 356 urban children from a broad socioeconomic range, while the 42 subjects of the longitudinal study were mostly from a low income range. The data were collected by use of Gesell's  interview schedules modified to suit Indian conditions, and, to determine personal-social development, aspects of behavior such as eating, dressing, and personal hygiene were considered. Of a total of 156 items, the results of the two studies were identical for 35 items and very similar for 26 items. Sixty-one items were not characteristic of any age group. (MH)",

The Stanford-Binet and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), were used to measure intellectual functioning, and experimental  task situations were used to obtain measures of attention, visual retention, visual discrimination, task persistence, divergent uses, and classification.

The contingency treatments compared during a 3-day social studies learning program were: Treatment 1: token reinforcement (raisins), chemical feedback (green or red dot shows on booklet when correct or incorrect response is marked), and verbal information; Treatment 2: verbal reinforcement (praise), chemical feedback, and verbal information; and Treatment 3: chemical feedback and verbal information only. Also, paired  associate tasks were run with half of the subjects in Treatment 1 receiving token reinforcement and half of the subjects in Treatment 2 receiving verbal reinforcement. All groups performed significantly better on the post-test than on the pretest. The subgroup continuing to receive token reinforcement was significantly superior to its matched subgroup: this was not true of verbal reinforcement. Neither reinforcer appears to be necessary as children can learn to receive feedback stimuli as information signals. (MH)",

Language arts materials can be classified according to function: (1) those that encourage imitating the English language, (2) those that associate symbols with meaning, (3) those that aid in the recognition of symbols and symbol systems, (4) those that support the use of symbols for communication, (5) those that aid the development of physiological function, (6) those designed strictly for reading, and (7) those that can be called literature. New rationale should be used in the selection of children's literature, rationale that would  weigh heavily the possibility for children to enjoy and identify with the story. Approaches to language arts curriculum and materials must consider (1) the way all children learn language, and (2) the pattern of anticipatory behavior and the relation of antecedent practice to later goals. The younger the child, the more language must play a supportive role to sensory learning. (MH)",

An episode sampling technique was used to study patterned interactions with children, teachers, and observers. Each of the boys was observed in interaction with his mother and father by three observers in a semi-structured laboratory setting. The parents were then interviewed while the child was again studied in laboratory interaction. Six judgments for dependence and competence were made for the child while the parents were assessed by multiple methods on four variables. Variables included three \"types\" of parental treatment (treats child as an adult, as an infant, or as a child), and three methods for assessing parental consistency. It was found that  the parents of competent children treated the child as a child, rather than as an adult, to a greater extent than did the parents of dependent children. The prediction of a greater tendency by parents of dependent children to infantilize the child was not clearly supported. The parental consistency, as assessed by the discrepancy between global judgments for the parents' philosophy and natural tendencies, was supported indicating that the parents of dependent children were not doing (nature) what they thought they should (philosophy) to the extent the parents of competent children were.

A secondary objective was to determine the extent to which the letter-sound discrimination would generalize to the skill areas of omitting the desired sound when shown the letter, and of constructing the letter when the appropriate sound was presented. Subjects were 4 mentally retarded males in primary and intermediate special aid classes who were chosen because of their lack of knowledge of the sounds of letters. Subjects performed on teaching machines for 15 minutes on each of 14 consecutive school days. Each subject was alternately exposed to each of two stimulus methods. Each method provided  discrimination training of letter sounds and symbols for 13 of the 26 letters in the alphabet. Pre- and post-test data showed that errorless form discrimination training was as effective as customary trial-and-error discrimination training in producing gains. However, the errorless method differed in respect to daily performance, for it generally resulted in a higher percentage of correct responses made in less time than did the trial-and-error method. The letter-sound associations which were mastered did not often generalize to related verbal skills. (Author/DR)",

The program utilized language development methods, individualized instruction, and parental assistance to improve the children's competencies. Using 4 hypotheses, the investigators attempted to identify significant differences in reading, arithmetic, and language development with the preschool and primary students as compared to 1966 baseline data. Using the Stanford Reading Test, the California Reading Test, a project designed Sight Vocabulary Test, and the Malabar Vocabulary Test with the sample, it was concluded that there were significantly higher scores on the reading tests by  children in the experimental program when compared to baseline groups and there was evidence of significant achievement in oral language development. In addition, experimental third-grade pupils were slightly superior in total arithmetic scores. Achievement differences between the sexes were also cited. Recommendations included using the Malabar experiment as a model for Los Angeles; employing research aides for part-time teacher assistance; expanding the program to the 4-6 grade level; and providing inservice training for school personnel.

Recommendations are given (1) for additional social-worker-type supervision; (2) for improvement of instruction, parental education, general adult education, additional vocational education, increased guidance and counseling services, addition of psychological special services, and special education; (3) for pre-school and kindergarten education; and (4) for a  general supervisor of instruction.

In both schools, pupils are enrolled from grades 1 through 12, and standardized tests were administered at selected grade levels. The analysis and results of the study are presented for each school separately, and the assumption is made and supported that achievement patterns of the 2 schools are indeed different due to differing pupil backgrounds. The report concludes with a broad general summary of each school separately and a section for utilizing test results that may be equally applicable to both schools.

Language difficulties were cited as being prevalent in both situations. English was reported to be the second language for the Alaskan, while Norwegian (which is completely different from the Lappish language) was the tongue spoken in those schools. Cultural differences were mentioned as a major factor in education. Geographic isolation was significant in Alaska, while the Lapps were slow to understand the value of education. Coombs, concerned with the educational deficits cited in the Coleman Report of 1966, suggested vicarious experiences for the students through multimedia instruction, improved teaching of English, more native teachers and more  cross-culturally adept non-native teachers, improved training and selection of teachers, program development, adult education, community involvement, and more interaction with the rest of the world. Boon noted the need for better language instruction, an upgrading of the Lapp economy, and a narrowing of the gap between the goals of education and the goals of the Lapp family unit.

Cross-cultural effects were seen to be of substantial influence in the development of problems. Relatively simple, isolated community structures prevailed in early northern Canada but, in recent years, a process of urbanization has eliminated many of the smaller communities. Technology and the influx of non-indigents have also affected the region. An awareness of these factors, plus the uniqueness of the Canadian Eskimo culture and characteristics, was seen as essential to understanding this minority group. (BD)",

The study was also directed at those areas in which special services were needed to improve the school program. Methodology employed in the study was that of the participant observer in the Indian community. The target area for this study was the Ahfachkee Elementary Day School, established in 1940 by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a thatched roof hut and now replaced by a well-equipped, air-conditioned, 2-classroom structure with an  enrollment of 40 (1968-69) and 2 teachers and a teacher aide. The study points out the personalized atmosphere the Federal day school provides for the children, which results in high attendance but is contrasted by the high dropout rate when they transfer to the public school in Clewiston as they enter the fifth grade. A typical day at Ahfachkee is described, and evaluative remarks are made of the academic program. The educational future of Seminoles on Big Cypress is also discussed. (EL)",

The ideal situation would be an integrated studies program wherein teachers from all disciplines would work together to assist the bilingual student in language development by preparing vocabulary lists, book lists, and procedural guides.

Efforts to develop social organizations with Indian leadership in order to keep ties with tribal customs and to adjust themselves to urban life were pointed out. The primary concern of this survey, conducted by students of Macalester College among 48 Indian adults, was the Indians' adaptation to urban living. Methodology was a door-to-door solicitation of responses to a questionnaire relating to social adjustment and attitudes of adults toward young people. It was tentatively concluded that the environment in the  city and the acceptance of Indians by the general population served as a major impetus in the Indians' adjustment to urban life.

The sample consisted of 126 male and female students, 87 of whom were Mexican American. Scales were developed from questionnaire and interview data to measure language background, self-concept of ability, achievement orientation, parental independence training practices, parental achievement pressure, social distance, and socioeconomic status. Student achievement was measured both by English and mathematics grades and by  standardized tests. Observed sociocultural differences between Mexican American and Anglo students appeared to be due to ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic and other social conditions associated with this background. Mexican American students exhibited many of the characteristics of the culture of poverty described by Oscar Lewis. Part of the depressed achievement of Mexican Americans, when compared to Anglo students, can be attributed to their lower self-concepts of ability; fatalistic, present-time orientation; non-democratic independence training experiences; and high religious social distance.

Such knowledge was deemed to be important in determining which words should be included in the content of reading materials designed for initial reading instruction. The hypotheses were that the graphoneme is a readily identifiable matrix within the structure of English words and that a frequency distribution of graphonemes occurring in the vocabulary of elementary school children would provide priorities for teaching purposes. This study dealt only with the decoding process. In identifying words, the 1962 edition of the Thorndike Barnhart Beginning Dictionary was examined and every tenth  word marked. Seven generalizations were concluded from the data. The study also lent validity to the assumption that the graphoneme is a useful matrix to be recognized within a word and enforced the concept of movement away from monosyllabic toward the early introduction of multisyllabic vocabulary.

Reading Readiness skills are being taught within a classroom management framework of extrinsic reinforcement, followed by tapering schedules utilizing token reinforcement, with the goal of building and maintaining intrinsic contingencies for entry skill and reading readiness behaviors. Dependent task breakdowns were prepared for subareas under the following categories: associative vocabulary, sensory attributes, numerical concepts, matching and perceiving differences, listening, and aural discrimination. A greater number of lessons were written for associative vocabulary tasks based on evidence that deficits  attributable to culturally deprived children cluster in this factor. Each lesson package contains teacher directions, stimulus picture cards, example cards, and individual child worksheets. Sample lessons for auditory discrimination of initial consonant p, spacial relation concepts towards and away from, and an alphabet lesson for distinguishing p, g, and q are included. (CM)",

Subjects were three groups of 21, 21, and 22 children each, with mean IQ's of 98.2, 108.1, and 118.0, respectively. Three experimental tasks, individually administered to each subject, measured visual recognition memory (VRM), paired-associate learning (PAL), and association ability (PA). The Gibson letter-like stimuli were used in the VRM and PAL tests, and colors were used with vowels in the PA test. A 2x3 analysis of variance on the PAL data indicated that visual recognition memory was a significant main effect. This result supported the hypothesis that children with high visual recognition memory will do better on a PAL task than children  with low visual recognition memory. Visual recognition memory was found to be independent of IQ, and as hypothesized, good readers scored higher on the VRM tasks than did poor readers. However, differences between good and poor readers on the PA and PAL tasks were not found. Tables and references are included. (Author/CM)",

Three of the critical issues encountered, among many, and the solutions found for them are given. The issues were (1) random assignment of pupils to project services, (2) choice of a model of analysis appropriate to the program's data collection procedures, and (3)  the determination of whether or not experimental and control pupils received significantly different final reading marks from their classroom teachers.

The major factors which influenced and shaped the development during 5 decades are listed. During the period from 1920 to 1929, reading tests, tachistoscopes, workbooks, and eye cameras became readily available. From 1930 to 1939, the advent of mechanical aids influenced program development. The decade from 1940 to 1949 saw the continued proliferation of programs (258 in 1942) and the conflict of competing ideologies. Commercial interest in adult reading programs and the organization of several professional reading groups characterized the period from 1950 to 1959. Although large amounts of federal aid to reading programs became available from 1960 to 1969, college programs, per se,  received a relatively small share. During the 55-year history of the college reading program, a body of relevant literature has evolved. Major sources of information on college reading are cited. A 36-item bibliography is attached.

Standardized tests are being used extensively to determine the students' reading levels, but almost all of those tests examined showed they are neither able nor designed to meet the demands of the decision situations in which they are often being used. In addition, many situations exist in which the results of these standardized  reading tests are being misused and misinterpreted.

Subjects were a 15-year-old Filipina and a 12-year-old American girl who had received instruction in rapid reading. Both successful and unsuccessful reading behavior of each in the test situation was observed by a group of reading experts.

The 12-year-old girl attained a rate of 54,825 words per minute with 90 percent comprehension on a more difficult essay. While reading, the eye movements of only the subject's right eye were recorded with the photo-electric mystagmographic instrument (PENG).

        "description":"The capability of the very young child to learn selected reading skills and the effectiveness of the television medium to present such skills were investigated. Television as the facilitator of such an instructional program was viewed as appropriate because of its ability to reach so many children, especially the disadvantaged. Ninety children who had passed their second birthday but who had not yet reached the third month past their fifth birthday were randomly selected from a group who had responded to an invitation to be on a children's television show. The children were given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary test and were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group was given systematic reading instruction via 12 weekly closed circuit television  sessions lasting from 15 to 20 minutes once a week. Post-testing showed that the children could be effectively taught selected reading skills. References are included. (NH)",

The author points out several factors which help shape the community's attitude toward the school, including the local control issues. The community's attitude toward reading has been shaped and is being shaped, says the author, by three factors: a comparison of center-city school students' reading progress with that of students from other schools, the proposal of United States Commissioner of Education James Allen that every person has a right to read, and the appearance of black authors speaking out for blacks. The  author underscores the importance of developing reading as a communicative skill that must be preceded by the development of listening and speaking skills in the center-city schools.

Recent developments on this topic are briefly reviewed. Questions are raised concerning what is a suitable criterion level for word recognition. The original criterion of 95 percent correct pronunciation for word recognition is considered too high. The application of one set of performance standards uniformly across all grade levels is questioned. Neither quantitative nor qualitative uniformity across passage levels is considered appropriate in dealing with errors. It is noted that present knowledge of the IRI precludes definitive statements concerning the hierarchial relation of the independent, instructional,  and frustrational reading levels. The real value of the IRI is seen as affording the possibility of evaluating reading behavior in depth and as offering potential for training prospective teachers about reading behavior.

Following an 8-week baseline period, second, fourth, and sixth graders of both high and low reading achievement were randomly assigned to no-conference, teacher-conference, or aide-conference groups. During the 8-week conference period, children met individually with an adult once a week for 5 to 10 minutes. The adults implemented such motivational principles as positive reinforcement, feedback, modeling, and goal-setting. While all three groups increased in number of books read from the baseline to the experimental periods, subjects receiving conferences increased significantly more. The superiority of the  conference condition was true for all grades and achievement levels. There was little difference between teacher- and aide-conducted conferences. The conferences did not produce a differential gain in reading achievement, probably due to the relative brevity of the experimental period. References are included. (Author/NH)",

This project was based on the philosophy that since the migrant child's social and language patterns are different from those of the mainstream of America and since these differences were common for 85 percent of the population of the Somerton school, the school and not the child should be changed. Teachers attended graduate courses and taught in the summer program where the pupil-teacher ratio was small. The unit approach was used because it correlated language and reading programs with the content areas. Flexible grouping on the basis of reading levels and/or interests was used, and the language-experience approach was  introduced to beginning readers. Training in diagnostic skills was provided the teachers; a number of tests were used. Also, an English as a Second Language program (ESL) was incorporated at all levels--kindergarten through grade 8, and special programs in home economics, shop, physical education, art, and music were also provided.

The experimental group consisted of 499 seventh-grade students in seven parochial schools in San Francisco. These students used the text and laboratory materials supplied through the inservice program. Their performance on the Portland Science Test was contrasted with the performance of other seventh grade students in two control groups. The first control group consisted of 475 seventh-grade students of the previous year in the same schools. The second control group consisted of  127 seventh-grade students of the academic year 1967-68 in four parochial schools located away from San Francisco by matching the socio-economic level, the preparation of the teachers, and the use of the text. Major findings of the study were (1) that there were significant differences between the mean scores in 1968 and 1967, (2) that, in every instance, the mean score achieved in 1968 was lower than the score in 1967, and (3) that there were no significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group and the mean scores of the second control group.

The sample consisted of 2339 grade twelve chemistry students enrolled in the General Course in Ontario High Schools. Part one of the study was accomplished by computing Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between subject scores on the Ontario Test of Achievement in Chemistry (OTAC), an investigation constructed test, and teacher-assigned grades as well as students' scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, Ontario edition (SATO) 1963-64. The  results indicate that teacher-assigned grades are not highly related to the OTAC score. To carry out part two of the study, the University of Michigan Automatic Interaction Detector computer program was used to identify variables contributing to the explainable variance of the two sets of achievement scores. This program also isolated groups of students in which different combinations of the predictor variables functioned most effectively. (LC)",

The author reports that the model has been used by classroom teachers to identify the domain and level of difficulty for instructional objectives. It permits the teacher to identify which psychological theory is acceptable to the philosophy of his school and the nature of the instructional task. These decisions then lead logically to a determination of  the emphasis to be placed on each aspect of subject matter and which style of teaching method and what instructional materials are to be employed. Educational researchers have used the model to codify research studies and to determine the implicit theories and philosophical viewpoints which are rarely stated in educational research reports.

The author has identified nine research studies and several surveys concerned with ESCP since that time. Of the nine research studies, six were primarily concerned with achievement outcomes. The findings of the six studies seem to indicate that ESCP is superior to non-ESCP earth science in affecting student achievement. However, a clear-cut case for this could not be established. Two of the studies (Sargent, 1966 and Schirner, 1968) indicated that the combination of the right curriculum with the appropriate teacher was an important factor in influencing student outcomes. The surveys, all conducted by the ESCP Staff, pertained to  student attitudes, teacher preparation programs and teacher professional background. The one survey discussed in this review indicates that the astronomy unit was a favorite of a majority of students who studied ESCP. The last section of the review is devoted to raising questions for further educational research. This is done through the aid of an instructional sequence model. (LC)",

The conference considered the relative advantages of undergraduate education in chemistry at liberal arts colleges and universities. The role of the colleges in contemporary chemical education was summarized on the basis of quantitative data when that was available, and otherwise on the basis of the consensus of opinion of the conferees. Four invited speakers contributed statements on the preparation of graduates of the colleges for graduate study at a university, and on the problems of &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;have not&quot; colleges. The informal consensus of the conference in a number of areas for which no supporting  data are available are presented as statements in response to questions which emerged as the focus of concern throughout the discussion. These statements are followed by discussion of some alternatives to the traditional undergraduate program. The conference also prepared recommendations on faculty, instrumentation and its maintenance, and curriculum. The report concludes with a list of problems on which data are inadequate, and which are sufficiently important to justify serious additional study. (LC)",

The problems are of two major types: (a) Those of a practical nature; e.g. How can science instruction be given on an individual basis to first graders who do not read? (b) Those of a philosophical nature; e.g. Is an individualized model of instruction compatible with the goals of science education?

A third group read a five-hundred word passage dealing with the same information as was covered on the other group of advance organizers. A fourth group functioned as a control group. Following the examination of the organizers, all students read a 1,100-word new learning task dealing with continental drift which  used ocean floor features as illustration of the theory.

The basic format for the salary presentations is the maturity curve in which salary appears as a function of years of experience. Some of the major findings of the survey include (1) the fact  that engineering technicians as a group have received salary increases averaging between 17 and 22 percent during the period 1966-69, (2) the increases ranged from $1,600 to $1,700 annually for technicians with ten or more years of experience whereas the increases at lower levels of experience were typically around $1,200 or $1,300, (3) the median annual salary for graduate technicians started at $7,200, while that for non-graduate technicians was $5,800, and (4) the difference in salary between graduate and non-graduate technicians becomes less and less with increasing experience.

The sample consisted of seventy-five students in grades one through six at the Oakleaf Elementary School. On two separate occasions each student was given the branched computer test using a teletypewriter. After completing the branched test, students were required to take a paper and pencil test on all remaining objectives not included on the branched test. Thus, a measure of proficiency of every objective in the unit was recorded.  Individual test profiles resulting from the study were used to ascertain the validity of the unit's structure. The results showed that criterion-referenced branched testing can be used effectively for all students in an IPI setting. Further, the measures yielded by such a procedure can be at least as valid and reliable as those for a conventional test. (RP)",

Four principles of biological inquiry are identified: the principle of antecedent-consequent, the principle of structure-function, the principle of homeostasis, and the principle of regulation. The effects of different principles on the modes of inquiry  within a problem area are illustrated by comparing ecological research which focuses on the individual as the unit (an application of the principle of antecedent-consequent) with research that treats the community as a unit (using the principle of structure-function).

        "description":"A category system consisting of 36 categories was developed for classifying the verbal behavior of each pupil in high school biology lecture-discussion classes. Two classes each of eight high school biology teachers were observed and tape recorded for four consecutive days. Classroom interaction was coded combining a teacher-behavior category system with the pupil behavior system. The data were organized into interaction matrices, and frequencies of different modes of pupil participation were calculated. Behavior sequences were studied, and common cyclical patterns were identified. It was found that in the average classroom two pupils accounted for about 25% of pupil talk, four pupils for about 50% and eight pupils for about 75%. Pupil characteristics significantly related to  participation were sex and previous achievement. Not related were intelligence (measured by Lorge Thorndike and California Test of Mental Maturity), School and College Aptitude Test scores, and attitude toward teacher, subject and class (measured by the Michigan Student Questionnaire). Final achievement in biology (measured by the New York Regents Examination and the teacher's final grade) was positively correlated with participation. (EB)",

Three classes of research parts are identified from the literature: individual organisms or species, pairs of organisms or species, and groups of organisms or species. Research emphasizing these parts rather than the community as a whole is analyzed in terms of the principles of biological inquiry discussed in the first paper. A second section of the paper shows how accounts of the community as a whole can be built from the results of research on parts, and discusses different conceptions of the relationship between parts and whole. The third section analyzes research beginning with an emphasis on the whole.

Treatment conditions were used which modeled reward conditions: (1) a neutral, no-overt-reward condition in which the tester quietly observed the subject working at the tasks; (2) a condition in which rewards were delivered only for acceptable solutions to the task problem; (3) a condition in which reward was not necessarily congruent with task achievement and in which rewards were delivered on a fixed time schedule. The experimental tasks were categorization or sorting tasks which required the children to attend to various physical properties of objects and to group them dichotomously on the basis of  these properties. Findings indicated that the use of verbal rewards which are not congruent with behavior will result in less efficient problem-solving then either a neutral, no-reward situation, or the use of rewards which are congruent with the problem-solving behavior.

Teaching emphasis is on comprehension and evaluation or problem solving, demanding repetitive analysis-synthesis in the hierarchical development of skills, abilities and knowledge. An analysis of covariance was conducted for one experimental class which was divided into small groups of 3-4 for interaction and group decision making (systems approach), and four control classes  (lecture, discussion).

The major focus is a curriculum that encompasses social and occupational concepts, facts, and behaviors that are consonant with social adaptation during maturation and at maturity. Academic learning is a means to the end. EMR children require daily language arts and arithmetic as communication and social problem-solving tools. All other areas of learning are integral aspects or motivators in social learning and avenues for self-expression. There is a dynamic relationship between the elements of the curriculum and the systematic ways of learning as managed by the teacher. Subject matter determines the  characteristics of the teaching-learning transaction or experience and the roles of teacher and student. The categorization of mature retardate behaviors allows categorization of the curriculum into blocks. A three-dimensional model of the developmental curriculum includes: transactions with the interrelated social, psychological, and physical phenomena; and, the vertical progression of maturation or competence through five interrelated environments (self, home and family, neighborhood, community, and extra-community).

        "description":"The Anthropology Curriculum Study Project (ACSP) has developed a research model which is to be used to provide data for effective implementation of the ACSP course, &quot;Patterns in Human History&quot;. The common &quot;means-ends&quot; model for research, which relies on one-way effects, is described and rejected in favor of an interactive, &quot;transactional&quot; model. The introduction of new curricula is construed as a process of intervention, altering the teacher's cognitive map and thereby his patterns of teaching, and learning behavior. This research strategy is discussed as an attempt to identify and map the expressive behaviors of teachers and students as they interact in the classroom; to analyze these persistant patterns in terms of data about the psycho-cultural orientations of individuals;  and, to relate these orientations to the school as a social system. The data included are: perception of self, perceptions of others, personality structure, and perceptions of process. Responses to external intervention are understood through the analysis of the interrelationship of these variables. This model is to be used also in assessing the curriculum materials, various teaching styles, and patterns of learning behavior (cognitive processes) in terms of the course behavioral objectives. The components of the ACSP Research Program are enumerated. (SBE)",

        "description":"Trends in social studies education in the 1960's which appeared significant and which may well affect the developments of the next decade include: (1) curriculum evangelism--the zealous, uncritical pursuit of fashionable educational ideas--and the institutionalization of innovative changes, (2) restraints on intellectual freedom by the radical right and by the disenchantment of the emerging youth culture with the liberal-reformist tradition, (3) conflicting trends in international education--new programs treating Afro-Asian cultures from a non-western perspective vs. a simplistic, naive view of world affairs; state-required anti-communism courses vs. the Foreign Policy Association's K-12 program. These trends are expected to affect teacher education by focusing attention on new  roles for change agents in in-service education and on the need for the systematic, somewhat protected and controlled entry into teaching. Professional literature in the 1960's has pointed up the need to prepare classroom practitioners to function \"as teachers of the real world.\" (DJB)",

        "description":"Egocentrism was investigated as an influencing factor in the development of the perceptual abilities needed to understand and interpret topographic maps. Attainment of an adequate concept of space, and the ability to accurately perceive spatial relationships (perspectives) are considered fundamental. Piaget and Inhelder identified three stages of conceptual development (age 4-6, no conceptualization of space; age 6-8, a child is bound by egocentrism, but understanding of spatial relativity has begun; age 7-12, evidences progressive discrimination and coordination of perspectives). The basic objective of this study was to test these generalizations with American elementary children, hypothesizing that there is a sequential pattern to conceptual development, but, that these three  stages would occur earlier in today's society. A test was designed to replicate and extend Piaget's. The relationships between perceptual abilities and each of these factors: chronological age, intelligence, socio-economic status, knowledge of left-right relationships were tested and found to be statistically significant. There was a definite negative correlation between the degree of egocentrism and the ability to understand and interpret maps. Overall, Piaget's developmental sequence was substantiated with the stages occurring at only slightly earlier ages. (SBE)",

The profession demonstrated little conviction as to the function and potential of social studies in general education; rather, it responded to \"what others wanted done.\" The social studies were discipline oriented, dominated by the scientific method (inquiry and discovery) and the traditional historical orientations. Students would have preferred the function of social studies and the schools to be what was called for by prominent social studies specialists of the 30's: self-fulfillment, consideration of relevant social problems, the criticism of failures of the system, and the building of a new social order. The 70's may bring a marked shift of emphasis. (This paper will be published later by the Social  Science Education Consortium). (DB)",

We are today involved in the most massive inward turning period in social science since World War II. We have to find answers to specific questions about such generalities as: (1) Who eats what? (2) What do we do with the \"waste products\"? (3) Who lives with whom in what kind of shelter? (4) Who dominates whom? (5) Who exploits whom? (6) Who has sexual relations with whom, under what circumstances, and to what ends? (7) Who invents what? (8) Who rationalizes what, and what form does the rationalization take? Theology? Science? Revolution? (9) Who teaches what and to whom? The anthropological way is to ask the question in such general terms that we perceive the vast differences from  one society to another, from one era to another. Today we as humans are dealing with the curse of culture. We have already had its benediction: we are not \"mere\" animals. We are gourmets, drivers of automobiles, etc. What is relevant is learning to live with the curse of culture rather than to die under it. As social studies teachers, we have to examine the curse, to help our students to see that it is a fact of life, and to help give them the courage to find challenges instead of cop-outs. (DJB)",

Essential to the social sciences is a random element, knowledge, and there is no way of predicting what will be known in the future. The non-random elements, however, allow some predictions. Demography predicts underpopulation in developed countries and the opposite in underdeveloped countries. Economics predicts a slackening of production in America because of resource and pollution factors. Political science predicts domination by the Republican Party unless new coalitions develop. Culture may continue its emancipation direction or be stopped by a puritan or neo-fascist reaction. \"Pressures for mondialization of culture are enormous.\" The Christian religions will continue to be adaptable, but some of the  clergy are continuously more radical than the laity. Spiritual crises are more likely to the communist world because of its secular eschatology. The rate of expenditure on education in the U. S. will increase and will require more federal support. Stability is predictable in the international system. Race relations regarding American blacks will improve as they take their place in the \"mosaic society.\" The \"integrative system\" will provide the real answer to success. (DJB)",

        "description":"During the 60's, systems for the observation of classroom behavior have become an important area of educational research. Many new systems have been devised both for the evaluation of teaching techniques and for basic research into teaching processes. In the development of such systems the investigator must determine what behaviors are to be observed. This in turn requires such considerations as dimensions of classroom behavior, types of observation systems, and units of behavior. The second task of the investigator is to decide how the observations are to be carried out, e. g., recording and coding of behavior, reliability of coding, and statistical analysis. Three illustrations of observation systems are: Flander's system of classroom interaction analysis (affective  dimensions), Bellack's observation of classroom discourse system (cognitive dimensions), and Oliver and Shaver's observational system for analyzing styles of teaching (affective and cognitive dimensions). The range of applicability of many observation techniques is limited and many investigators feel the need to devise their own. This has its drawbacks for comparisons even though the current state of the art often makes it necessary. (DJB)",

The children and their teacher had been motivated by a summer crisis which had the city in a turmoil. They decided to investigate what could be done to improve the community, and, to make the community their classroom. Newspapers were devoured, city authorities and personnel on the Redevelopment Planning Board were interviewed, the slums were visited, conditions with regard to education and recreation were researched. An elementary teacher education class at San Francisco State College worked with them. The sixth grade plan included: cooperative integrated housing projects, an African-Negro Cultural  Center, a rapid transit line, medical facilities, new schools, and, parks and recreational facilities. The costs of their plan were analyzed, and it was suggested that the State, the City, and the Federal Government would share these costs. The residents of the community would take part in planning and the actual construction thereby providing jobs for the black residents. Later, as a compliment to their dreams, the city approved a plan for this area incorporating many of their ideas. (SBE)",

The hypothesis grew out of recent political science research. 297 fifth, eighth, and eleventh grade children and 205 of their parents were interviewed. (See Appendix A for questionnaires.) Some of the results are: 1) There is substantial political growth during adolescence in a number of respects, even though it is perhaps not as great as that which occurs before eighth grade. 2) Parents and children do show many resemblances in political orientations; but the magnitude of the correlations is in general relatively low, and in a few cases such correlations are negative. 3) Black and white children do exhibit somewhat different patterns of political learning when grade level is  controlled; but both are relatively supportive, and only in a general sense are the white children earlier in their development and more system-supportive. 4) A number of explanatory variables show specific effects upon the child's developing political orientations; but these vary both by content and by grade level. More detailed future analysis of the variables analyzed in this research can be guided by this study. (Author/DJB)",

It was concluded that the GSA effected behavior change although its component parts (self-confrontation and videotape-coding) did not. It appears that the GSA induces dissonance by structuring the subject's perception in such a way that he identifies discrepencies between his ideal and his actual behavior. Behavior change is promoted by the drive for consonance and is  facilitated by the operational nature of the GSA schedules. It is suggested that the ultimate test of the effectiveness of GSA as a program for professional development is not its effects upon teacher behavior, but its effects upon \"pupil achievement, pupil attitude, and the development of social skills and thinking skills.\" Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, will use GSA for inservice and preservice training programs.

A &quot;syllogistic model of meaning&quot; was devised to treat all the concerns of linguistics, semantics, kinesics, proxemics, and paralinguistics. Socio-economic subcultures were not considered.

Specific experiences in a concrete situation are linked to these basic abstract concepts by the mini-drama. It has North American characters with whom the listener can identify. This presentation and group discussion are a part of a process of self-confrontation.

DL is a form of deliberate enculturation, but it is distinguished from schooling by its informality. Further, schooling is not found in non-literate societies. The major problem in studying the structure and function of education in primitive societies is the dearth of detail available in the literature. New methods for analyzing the literature must be developed to answer: \"Who educates? On what does the educational process focus? How is the information taught?\" The author has devised diagrams of the boundaries of social interaction and of the deliberate instruction (DI) interaction pattern, a chart of the agents of DI instruction, a schedule of the  teaching-learning situation-process, and other tools to aid his analysis. Two of the working hypotheses for future study are included: the structure of DL is determined by features of the instruction and the social setting; and, every society has individuals who act as teachers.

This experience should constitute a direct involvement in the activities and way of life of a given group of people in an urban community. The legitimacy of urban sub-cultures must be recognized, and the element of critical judgment of other cultures suspended. Such programs, which have a great deal to accomplish in a short time, can be most successful if they are based on a consideration of the type of people to be trained. Recent research indicates that teachers are most effective and satisfied when working with children whose ethnic and socio-economic background are similar to their own. Thus, recruitment for urban teacher education  programs should give first priority to ethnic and social class origin. The next highest priority group should consist of individuals who are aware of the contradictions in our society and are committed to a realistic approach. (RT)",

Typical problems encountered in reviewing research on the relationship of teacher behavior to preparation programs are the lack of replication  of studies, the lack of information given on specific research procedures, and the lack of a common theoretical framework. One step toward overcoming these problems would be the establishment of an evaluation team for screening research relevant to teacher education. Organizations like NEA and AERA could cooperate to develop standardized research designs to be made available to teacher preparation programs. (RT)",

A total of 200 teachers ordered programs and 11 wrote complete research reports. Many others wrote brief reports. The major problem confronted by teachers in conducting this research was the limited choice of subjects. It was also found that although most participating teachers were quite well versed in research procedures, some of them tended to draw conclusions not justified by the research design. The overall conclusion of the  teachers' reports was that programed instruction is equally as effective as teacher instruction, but not more so. The results from both aspects of this study indicate that research should be done on effective methods of combining programed and teacher instruction, and that more support and assistance should be given to teacher research.

Two randomly assigned groups of tenth grade students used a different four-word set of difficult vocabulary items each day for 15 days. Time taken for the exercise and an achievement score provided two dependent variables. Two instructional methods were used: matching words to synonyms, and reading and rewriting definitions. In the first study students worked with one method for ten days, switched to the other for three and returned to the original for two. In the second study, students used the same method throughout. Results, illustrated by graphs, showed that students performed  better in terms of achievement and time as practice continued. The synonym method appeared to be the more interesting, though not necessarily the better, of the two and provided immediate feedback to the student. Study 1 proved to be biased against the definition group, and the achievement test was changed in Study 2 to a sentence completion approach to be fair to both groups. The exploration of a wider variety of criteria is recommended for future studies. (MBM)",

A Study was therefore undertaken to contrast the philosophic orientation, logical consistency, and teaching attitudes of elementary and secondary school teachers in two St. Louis school districts--one lower socio-economic and urban, the other, middle socio-economic and suburban. A total of 318 teachers responded to the GNC Scale of Logical Consistency in Ideas about Education and the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to ascertain differences between and with the two districts according to sex, age, degree, and teaching level. As a group, the suburban teachers were more  logically consistent in relating their theoretical ideas to their practical views about education. The highest level was demonstrated by the suburban 20-29 age group. No differences were found between the districts in the maintenance of prescribed teaching attitudes by teachers. Results indicate that if logical consistency in educational ideas is desirable, more of the type of young teachers currently aspiring for suburban teaching should instead be encouraged to teach in urban schools.

Results showed a significant difference  between the two groups in their use of indirect verbal behavior. These results support earlier findings on imitation.

Ninety-four percent of the questionnaires were completed, showing that 94.7 percent of the responding districts use paraprofessionals, with slightly more in city and suburban than in rural districts. Paid paraprofessionals, of whom there are twice as many as unpaid, are most used as room, library, teaching, playground, monitorial, and audiovisual aides, with voluntary workers as library, teaching, lunchroom, health service, remedial, and playground aides. Voluntary aides seem most successful  in one-to-one services to children, which are more social than clerical. The majority of the school districts require either high school diploma or some college experience; 68 percent have no minimum age limit and 84 percent have no maximum. About 25 percent provide special training programs. The first reported use of paraprofessionals was in 1940-44, with the numbers increasing greatly since 1960. If more funds and personnel were available, 86.7 percent of the districts report that they would use even more. There are very few cases where the use of paraprofessionals was rejected because of school board, teacher, or parent opposition. Details of the survey are given in 16 tables. (MBM)",

Their ethnic origins and the rich cultural backgrounds of both Mexico and Spain are described, as well as the Spanish settlement of the Southwest and California. The widespread disregard for the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which called for the free enjoyment of liberty, property, and religion, and the U.S. settlement of the West in the goldrush led to their being downgraded as citizens by means of new land registry laws and legal systems, the  requirement of literacy in English as a voting qualification, and an Anglo-dominated school system. The employment of immigrant day-laborers along the border and the prevelance of Spanish-language newspapers, movies, and radio programs have hindered the equal acceptance of Mexican Americans. The present Chicano movement is doing much to advance the recognition of their cultural values and to encourage a movement toward social justice, but it is still uncertain whether they will ultimately choose assimilation or biculturalism.

The ten program components examined were: university-school district cooperation; performance-centered objectives; instructional systems; microteaching; sensitivity training; nonclassroom activity; in-district course work; seminars and group meetings; classroom teaching; and supervision and evaluation. The only two components which were  deemed unfeasible were nonclassroom activity--administratively and educationally unfeasible--and in-district course work--administratively unfeasible. Availability of materials and personnel was a problem in microteaching, and it was felt to be feasible only for small groups.

Items for the scale were generated by using a model including two institutions responsible for the student teaching experience, four psychological needs (for achievement, independence, self-esteem, and social approval) and 18 aspects of a student teaching experience. Development and testing involved 12 stages: 1) definition of concepts; 2) construction of 144 scale items; 3) classification of items according to need; 4) classification on favorableness-unfavorableness scale; 5) determination of  reliability of (3) and (4); 6) selection of items for preliminary scale; 7) administration of scale to pilot group; 8) selection of items for final scale; 9) establishment of split-halves of final scale; 10) administration of final 50-item scale; 11) completion of scale by eight supervisors; 12) analysis of responses. The supervisors' and students' scores both showed that the majority of students were favorable to the student teaching experience.

        "description":"In order to provide courses which are relevant and which will increase teachers' satisfaction with their pre- and in-service education, it is necessary to identify and assess those matters which most concern them. An instrument based on a three-stage model was devised: Stage 1, education majors who have never taught and who have no concern about teaching, stage 2, preservice teachers with a minimum of experience who are mainly concerned about their own performance, and stage 3, experienced teachers whose concern is for their pupils. The manual material deals with the second group, tracing six stages of concern, from orientation to teaching, through control, student relationship, student gain (both cognitive and affective), and personal growth and professional issues. The  development tasks for the student teachers and the instructional procedures in educational psychology are outlined for each stage. The assessment instrument is included, with instructions on scoring and an overview of the codes employed. Examples are given under each code to illustrate the type of statement which may be expected. Two appendixes give details of available material on teacher personal growth and a short bibliography of relevant research. (MBM)",

        "description":"The Profile of Interaction in the Classroom (PIC) is a short-cut method of interaction analysis that can provide the quick feedback essential to effective supervision of instruction. And because the PIC contains a record of all the behaviors that occurred in the classroom, as well as the sequence, the data may be used to build a traditional matrix. The PIC employs the ten categories and the 3-second rhythm of the Flanders System, but instead of using numbers, the PIC uses a tally mark for all ten behavior categories. The tallies are recorded in ten columns, each of which is divided into 40 one-minute rows. The rows are divided into 20 sections, each representing 3 seconds. Thus a behavior can be recorded in the appropriate numbered column and in a position within a row which  shows its place in the sequence of events. The primary advantage of the PIC over the traditional method is that it presents the data in an easier form for calculating the totals of different categories of behavior and the ratio of indirect to direct or student to teacher behavior.

The Micro-PIC is an abbreviated simplified form for analysis of shorter periods of interaction, particularly in microteaching. The Micro-PIC compresses the first three Flanders categories into one, and also combines categories six and seven. Each category is tallied in a separate column, using the Flanders 3-second rhythm. The Micro-PIC is most useful when the only information required is the ratio of indirect to direct teacher behavior, the ratio of student to teacher talk, or the ratio of self-initiated to response-to-teacher student behavior. When it is necessary to differentiate  between the different types of indirect or direct behavior, it would be best to use the PIC; when the sequence of events is of primary importance, the traditional Flanders system is best.

        "description":"Experiments were devised to determine teacher effectiveness on the basis of ability to communicate, on the assumption that no relevant learning will occur if communication is faulty. A series of communication games involved an encoder (teacher) and decoder (student) to provide tentative answers to the questions: 1) Are there individual differences in encoding abilities? 2) On what dimensions do the messages generated vary? 3) How do variations in encoding influence decodability? 4) What is the effect of feedback from the decoder? Two groups of materials were used, a wooden board with holes holding forms of different shape, color, and size and a crayon, cup, coin, box, pencil, and scissors. Results suggested that: 1) Adults differ substantially in their effectiveness in encoding  even simple messages. 2) Intellectual development is important in preparing an informationally adequate message. 3) There is a limit to the amount of information a child can retain and instructions must be broken into appropriate lengths if they are to be successfully handled. 4) The percentage of correct results will increase when the objects are visible during the period of instruction. 5) If information is transmitted more slowly, it will be more correctly interpreted. Two further studies are in progress to test the effects of feedback and to identify independent variables to account for success in communication.

The tendency in Asia to unite all types and levels of teacher education under a single authority has the potential either for a cooperative state board with representatives from the universities, teaching profession, and state government or for a state-controlled board which might threaten academic freedom. While there are also trends in Asia toward upgrading qualifications for entering teacher education programs and broadening the curriculum, there are problems in getting competent teachers and balancing the curriculum among community development work, languages (especially in multilingual countries), and general and professional study. Other  foreign countries are also said to share Asian educators' concern over whether or not all teachers should be required to study some subjects in depth, thereby giving them mobility between elementary and secondary levels. Trends and innovations cited outside of Asia include microteaching, simulation, feedback during practice teaching with walkie talkies, curriculum development centers, elimination of laboratory schools, 5-week projects to improve local school facilities, and staff borrowing between colleges and schools.

It was felt that by their mere presence in the classroom, the aides had an effect on the children and should thus be trained in appropriate behavior patterns and reinforcement techniques. A total of 14 aides--seven Negro, five Mexican-American, and two Anglo--from poverty backgrounds were divided into five groups, each headed by a teacher. Training procedures included group discussion of appropriate behaviors, demonstrations by teachers, practice with children, and immediate corrective feedback from the group leader. The aides were taught to observe and record a child's behavior and to give a positive response to good  behavior, rather than a threatening response to disruptive behavior. Evaluation by means of video tapes, behavior rating scales, a behavioral task, and attitude tests showed a change in the aides. Prior to the program they had agreed on the theoretical desirability of reinforcing good behavior, but had not practiced this method. After training, there was a definite increase in reinforcement behaviors. (RT)",

The program was initiated in September 1968 with tentative selections of commercial materials and the preparation of locally produced materials. By February 1969 a pilot run-through was possible and in the spring semester weekly evaluation meetings were held and student teachers had direct supervisory support and evaluation in using the new techniques. Themes were written, then recorded on tape  with both versions being submitted to the instructor, who marked grammatical and punctuation errors on the paper and recorded comments on more abstract matters on the tape. Pre-recorded 20-minute lectures dealt with subjects such as organizational patterns, sentence variety, paragraph arrangement, etc. Representative student papers were recorded on television to serve as a library/clinic for students.

Methods used to determine effectiveness include measurement of pupil gains, job analysis, and pupil ratings of teachers, all subject to inherent fallacies and limitations. The California Definition, published in 1952 by the California Teachers Association, has since been officially adopted by the state and identifies six teacher roles on the basis of the group or individuals with whom the teacher works. In 1950 the American Educational Research Association appointed a seven-member committee which established two general categories, relating directly to teacher effectiveness and to observable  behavior and characteristics from which effectiveness may be inferred. In 1954 the American Psychological Association listed six categories: social validity, conceptualization, stability of the function, variability among the population, measurability, and ultimate-immediate relationships. An instrument developed at the University of Hawaii, using the California Definition as a base, is described with the suggestion that similar local instruments should be devised.

Each of 23 junior-level students enrolled in this first professional education course taught for 15 minutes in a junior high school class he had never seen before with a cooperating teacher he had just met. The novice teachers were filmed while teaching. They later viewed the films of their own performance and received feedback on their performance  from students and cooperating teachers. Reactions of teacher trainees to this experience indicated greater respect for the teaching profession and an increased concern with student achievement resulting from their teaching. It was also noted that classes tended to be consistent in their evaluation of the teacher trainee, and that this evaluation usually agreed with that of the cooperating teacher. (RT)",

It is the product of the process of performance contracting, in which a public authority grants money to a local educational agency to contract with private enterprise to achieve specific goals within a specific period for specific costs. This process can be engineered as follows: (1) the local educational agency employs a management support group (MSG); (2) the MSG works with other groups to produce a set of general specifications called a Request for Proposal (RFP); (3) the RFP is the subject of a pre-bidding conference; (4) the revised RFP is issued and actual bids are entertained; (5) the local school board selects the best bid and negotiates a performance contract with the aid of the MSG; (6)  the local education agency employs an Independent Educational Accomplishment Audit team (IEAA) to monitor execution of the performance contract and to certify results for purposes of payment. The Texarkana Dropout Prevention Program under ESEA Title VIII was the first to use performance contracting in education and it stimulated numerous inquiries and proposals from other cities.

The beginning teachers were asked how helpful their methods courses, teaching practice and non-educational courses were as preparation for teaching. A  majority found their preservice training irrelevant, experienced initial difficulties in the school and would have preferred greater definition of their roles, although they were grateful for the help they did receive and planned to continue teaching. Principals recognized the need for better induction programs but in many cases lacked the time to develop them. Separate studies are recommended to investigate the discrepancies between the teachers' and principals' evaluation of the induction programs and to increase the effectiveness of the methodology.

A third type, the anthropological \"participant-observer model,\" is proposed as a substitute for the first two. As a participant-observer, the teacher trainee would work independently as a bona fide  teacher within one classroom and would also observe other teachers in different schools and have discussions with them. The anthropological tradition of an intensive study of one small group could also have its equivalent in teacher education. One or two years of required elementary school teaching would help a teacher to perceive the organizational, social, and cultural factors which interact within a school setting. (RT)",

The specific functions of the paraprofessional are considered, as well as the problems which  arise if they seem to threaten the status of the professional or because of different and conflicting values and life styles. The success of the programs is seen to depend on proper selection, adequate training, clear definition of the role to provide for budgeting support and career development, and the successful interaction between supervising professionals and the paraprofessionals. Many major studies of the subject are cited in the text and there is a 65-item bibliography. (MBM)",

        "description":"A survey of 15 paraprofessional training programs which had OEO funding, Bank Street College of Education sponsorship and consultant service, and commitment to an experimental approach to team training of paraprofessionals and professionals was conducted to determine common trends in objectives, personnel, and methods. The fundamental objective of the programs was found to be the development of a team operation in the classroom and the improvement of interpersonal relations between paraprofessionals and professionals. The people selected to be trained were community members, often parents of children in school. Teachers participating in the programs were selected from a group of volunteers. At the beginning of most programs there were more paraprofessional volunteers than teacher  volunteers, but after a period of successful operation, these balances were reversed. Training activities usually consisted of team training for paraprofessionals and teachers, separate skill training for paraprofessionals, and separate leadership training for teachers. Some programs also offered course work for academic credit at cooperating colleges. Such career ladder training for school personnel is expected to undergo a great expansion as a result of funding now available through the EPDA. (RT)",

Although any Glassboro student (most of whom are education majors) may volunteer for the program, only those whose family income meets New Jersey OEO poverty index criteria receive the $46.00 weekly stipend. The program is divided into a summer phase and a winter phase. During the summer the VISTA volunteer works full-time in the community and participates in a VISTA-related college course, receiving 6 semester hours of credit. During the winter the VISTA volunteer takes 9-12 semester hours of regular college classes and works in the  community for the remainder of the time. He receives six credits for the VISTA work. The volunteers live in the community and serve with local community organizations. Some immediate results from the program have been the introduction of a public service elective for academic behavioral science majors, and expansion of community involvement in field experience for teacher trainees. VISTA volunteers have also provided feedback to the college on the relevance of their education. (RT)",

It defines the six areas as 1) director of learning, 2) counselor and guidance work, 3) mediator of the culture, 4) link with the community, 5) member of the school staff, and 6) member of the profession, and gives detailed analyses of each, resulting from continued study of each group. The need for a clear and widely accepted definition of the nature and range of teacher competence is emphasized and groups of questions are provided to assist in the study. The questions are directed to local associations of teachers, TEPS committees, groups responsible for inservice education, college and university  faculties, curriculum workers, guidance personnel, and administrators, and supervisors. Examples are given which illustrate the operational use of the definitions and indicate some of the misconceptions which may lead to disappointment and failure. Finally, the personal qualities of the successful teacher and the responsibilities of the preparing institution are briefly discussed. (Related to SP 003 944, in this issue.) (MBM)",

All 43 teachers in IPI programs in Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Idaho were used as subjects and each was rated on a Scale of Teacher Implementation of Individually Prescribed Instruction, with personality characteristics determined through Cattell's 16 Personality Factor questionnaire. Five specific hypotheses were tested, with the following results: 1) it was concluded from a multiple correlation that personality characteristics are not significantly correlated with success in IPI; 2) an analysis of variance technique was used with an F-ratio to compare  the means of each personality factor of teachers with high and low success scores, and no significant difference was found; 3) a chi-square test of independence showed that age is not a significant factor; 4) a chi-square test of independence showed that the number of years teachers remain in a position is independent of their success in IPI; 5) a chi-square test of independence showed that the number of years of teaching experience is independent of success in IPI. A more extensive study is recommended and the suggestion is made that IPI is so effective that the effects of differences among teachers are overcome. The rating scale of Teacher Implementation is included in an appendix. (Author/MBM)",

This report describes the development of a 4-hour teacher training session for SWRL's First-Year Communication Skills Program, intended to remedy the 1968-69 situation, when it was found that teacher-training via the district supervisor and a teacher's manual was inadequate for many teachers. The general areas leading to better teacher orientation were determined and then broken down into specific training objectives, based on what teachers should be able to do to promote pupil performance. A trial-revision sequence was employed, with changes made in accordance with developmental test data, and a  teach-test-remediate-retest model of instruction, called the unit instructional sequence, was specified as the key to the training objectives. Each unit had an activities and materials guide to determine daily objectives and locate materials. A daily assessment sheet enabled the teacher to test individually a random sample of her class each day and thus evaluate the performance of the whole class. The training package was used by five district supervisors with about 50 teachers. It was found that district personnel could implement the training satisfactorily with a minimum of time and supervisory responsibility. (MBM)",

Data from this scheme are intended to be fed into a systems model which enables an investigator to test the consistency and efficiency of educational systems. The model is used to compare an educational system's internal and external parts  and permits variables to be lined up within the internal part under operational objectives, status-role position, and status-role performance, and within the external part under educational values, school and administrative system, and education as a social system. In his analysis the author also accounts for four cultural aspects relative to education--historic, political, social, and economic.

Representing plot as structure, the basic elements of Richard Connell's \"The Most Dangerous Game\" can be quickly reviewed to debate and establish the denouement and the theme that \"life is for the strong.\" Illustrating theme as structure, Conrad Richter's \"Early Marriage\" has several rather easily distinguished structural motifs (e.g., the journey and the conquest of fear) whose specific details throw considerable light on the story's thematic structure. Exemplifying tone as structure, John Steinbeck's \"Flight\" can illustrate how the denouement is identified by the change in tone and  how the structure is unified by such recurring images as the surf, the knife, the accumulation and concomitant loss of things, the color black, and Mama Torres' resignation. Steinbeck skillfully uses these and other images to evoke a larger reality in his work which even less gifted students can readily perceive. (JB)",

Recently, modern linguists have argued that language study belongs to the liberal arts, not to the behavioral sciences; behaviorists have moved into literature study with programmed texts of literary works; and some psychologists and students have expressed the belief that an emotional experience is a necessary instrument for learning. Complicating the English curriculum dilemma are the present insistence upon measurable behavioral objectives and the ascendancy of film study, film making, and visual literacy. Apparently, a new goal for English is needed--to keep alive and to  foster and educate the imagination. Present social conditions imply a failure to educate people to emphasize with others or to reorder imaginatively the every day world.

A visual parallel to the opening sentence of a written composition, the \"establishing shot\" (the first important shot related to the theme of the movie) can be examined for its  connection to the rest of the film. Furthermore, the visual composition of various scenes can be examined for texture, camera angles, and positions of people and objects; students can then practice composition by taking polaroid pictures of carefully planned scenes. Through examining these film techniques with the stop-frame projector, students can develop their visual imagination and critical faculties. (LH)",

As students locate words and descriptions vertically on Korzybski's scale of abstraction levels, they will become able to perceive how meanings change when descriptions become either more general or specific, to differentiate between an idea and an example of an idea, and to discern patterns of abstraction levels in paragraphs and entire books. To make their writing more specifically useful, students should be encouraged to qualify isolated words with quantitative or identifying numbers and dates and to replace &quot;is&quot; with an active verb. By incorporating these writing aids, students will be reminded to constantly observe, question, and experiment with  meanings and to express their own ideas in modestly specific and accurate sentences.

        "description":"Eight classes (140 students) in 10th- and 11th-grade were taught English composition using either an \"errorless\" or a \"dialectical\" method, each involving a model paragraph. The progress of the students was examined using the STEP and Composition Rating Scales before and after the instruction. Significant changes in the students' scores occurred for both experimental methods over a period of a year. No differences were obtained between the students following the errorless and dialectical methods. During their 12th-grade, the students wrote another essay, and the results indicated that the changes noted during the original instruction persisted into the fourth year of high school for those who had been instructed while in the 11th-grade, but not for those who had been instructed a  year and a half earlier. Conclusions indicated that the importance of thoughtful imitation, a crucial step in learning the most sophisticated kinds of behavior, has often been underestimated in teaching. (Appendices provide a sample model paragraph, parts of an errorless and a dialectical lesson, an analysis of the model paragraph and practical exercises, and the composition rating scales.

Thoroughly educated in the English literary tradition, Achebe has created these novels enriched with African proverbs, idioms, and views of tribal life, but  dealing with a universal problem--that of maintaining individual integrity in a violently changing society where the faith on which morality is based is being challenged.

The free choice curriculum approach motivates the student who has chosen and committed himself to a particular course and maximizes the effectiveness and morale of the faculty. Disadvantages are the possibilities that teachers will not encourage student participation in curriculum planning, that course offerings will be limited in number, that slow learners may be ignored, that small schools would be handicapped by limited offerings, that the logistics of curriculum  planning could be overwhelming, and that students would graduate unacquainted with standard literary works. Despite these drawbacks, the curriculum has provided exciting results for both teachers and students.

Also reported are the results of research to develop fundamental methods of analysis to aid the scientific study of children's language. The data presented in extensive tables  and charts were obtained from annual oral interviews and their transcripts, written compositions, reading tests, I.Q. tests, listening tests, tests in the use of subordinating connectives, teachers' ratings, lists of books read, and miscellaneous other sources. Results are reported on the investigations into basic linguistic measures (e.g., average number of words per \"communication unit\" and \"maze\"), weighted indexes of elaboration, transformational analysis, verbs, and dependent clauses.

The Expressive Vocabulary Inventory (EVI), the instrument developed, consists of 40 items in which the child is shown a line-drawing and asked a question to which he answers the appropriate word or phrase. The EVI was given to 204 boys and 226 girls (145 Caucasian and 285 Negro, 300 low and 130 high socioeconomic status categories) in three age groups (36-47 months, 48-59  months, and 60-71 months). No statistically significant differences for sex were obtained within any of the age groups. Some support for a cumulative decrement could be seen by comparing the difference at age 3 with that at age 5, but the small number of 5-year- old children confounded the expected decrement with increase in age for the lower economic status children.

Rewriting  involves evaluating the work for large problems, such as organization and subject limitation, and later considering the individual units from word through paragraph.

Briefly, political exploitation for personal profit was followed by the theory that \"professionals\" should control the schools without \"outside interference.\" The present revolution is a direct reaction to the failure of the \"professionals\" to provide an adequate education for the disadvantaged. This revolution is going in five directions: decentralization in administration; involvement in decision making by lay people whose children are in the schools; use of professional or semi-professional staff such as aides and community coordinators and agents; the appearance of the \"community school\" with expanded social and educational services; and, the  emergence of radical teacher organizations which are demanding bargaining and decision making power. New York City's decentralization progress is discussed along with the proposed institution of 60 separate school districts. New Haven's experimental community school is also discussed as an excellent example of fusing city planning and educational and social service needs. (KG)",

This was administered along with a scale of 12 terminal values developed by Rokeach. Blacks ranked freedom first and equality second; whites ranked freedom and equality fifth. Blacks ranked a comfortable life fourth, and whites twelfth. The greatest differences between groups existed in the items dealing with  employment, race, and poverty, but a far greater difference emerged in the whites' views of blacks and the blacks' view of whites. Significant differences for all five attitudes became evident when the perceived attitudes of the races were compared. Data also showed a significant relationship between values and beliefs, i.e., those who ranked freedom and equality high had more liberal scores than those who ranked freedom high and equality low (Rokeach two-dimensional model was used). Tables with test data and a sample of the measuring instrument are appended. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (KG)",

Whether or not Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act can be a means for the establishment of equal educational opportunity in the nation's public schools remains academic; presently, it is simply an instrument of the Nixon Administration's evolving policy on desegregation. For almost five years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Division of Equal Educational Opportunities (DEEO) worked in relative obscurity cooperating with school systems seeking help in the transition from segregation to equality. In the spring of 1969, the Federal courts began to call on DEEO experts to prepare desegregation plans for school districts under court orders. Since then, the technical assistance aspects of  Title IV of the Civil Rights Act have been overshadowed or blocked by the lack of clear desegregation policies in the Administration, the Congress, and the Federal courts. Whether this is attributable to a retreat by the Nixon Administration from the goal of total desegregation or to a combination of circumstances more coincidental than deliberate, the net effect is that no clear Federal policy is discernible.

Male delinquents considered uneducable in traditional education programs, have been advanced two years in the one year they spent as participants in the differential operant treatment program in the Center. Students are assigned to cottages according to behavior categories measured by scales developed by Quay and others; these are inadequate and immature, neurotic, sociopath, or subcultural. Each cottage has a treatment program designed to meet the needs of the students assigned to the cottage. Motivation to complete program requirements is provided by the class level system, i.e., placing tangible  rewards into a ranked, three-level system, with the fewest rewards for the lowest level, more for the middle level, and all that is available for the highest level. The basic program strategy is the application of behavior modification principles derived from operant theory. Critical to the program are: (1) clearly defined behavioral objectives; (2) arranged reinforcement contingencies; and, (3) positive reinforcement. (JM)",

As the study proceeded, however, an effort was made to examine other aspects of the operation of the schools which related to the basic concerns which caused the grouping study to be requested. Where possible and appropriate, data have been collected, conclusions drawn and recommendations made that go beyond the question of grouping. In order to highlight the major findings and recommendations emerging from the study, they have been summarized and constitute the first section of this report. The second section provides a descriptive analysis of the present policies  and practices concerning the grouping of students for instruction in the Plainfield Schools. A follow-up study of the Class of 1968 from the time the students were in the seventh grade is reported in section three. Student personnel services, with particular attention to grouping, are dealt with in section four. Sections five, six, and seven report the attitudes and opinions of teachers, students, and lay community citizens, respectively. (JM)",

Community control, the subdivision of the large system into appropriate communities and the control of each community by its local citizens and their appointees, merits a trial. Among the actions needed to save our public schools are: making school board membership a fulltime, paid assignment; drastic curriculum revision; reform of educator selection and training methods and criteria; staffing schools with skilled organizers and advocates who will work with the people of the community at their direction and on their behalf; finding new, stable sources of public  revenues to finance public schools; clarifying the role of parents and teachers in the socialization of children in this urban-industrial world; making educational planning a joint school-parent venture; and, preparing the educational system to provide continuous education and reeducation to adults of all ages and backgrounds as well as to children.

Basically, the Educational Park is conceived as a large clustering of educational facilities serving all the schools on a campus, so as to bring together the school population of many small neighborhoods and thereby providing for the children and all the citizens of an entire larger urban community; within this fundamental notion, tremendous variation is envisaged. The content of the book focuses on: the internal space environment, economic impact of the Park, architectural design, administrative problems, educational programs, development site selection, transportation system,  use of air rights, community participation, cost considerations, and sociological conditions for and consequences of the Park for the community; guidelines are suggested for the implementation of such a Park project with reference to each of the areas discussed. Concluding remarks also emphasize that the Park proposal is no panacea, but that it is an opportunity within which each community must find its own way of applying the overall idea to their particular time and place.

The first, which was predicted to be invalidated by the data, and in fact was, is that the collective behavior and social life of the community conform to a \"culture of poverty\" which is supported by distinctive socialization patterns and which in turn perpetuates the condition of being poor. The second, which is now being explored, is that the collective behavior and social life of the community area are bicultural in the sense that each ethnic segment draws upon both  a distinctive repertoire of standardized Afro-American group behavior and, simultaneously, upon patterns derived from the mainstream cultural system of Euro-American deprivation.

Eighty-seven (90 percent sample) large, primarily white institutions returned questionnaires concerning their admissions policies for black students. Results indicated that very few blacks (3 percent of 1969 entering freshmen) are entering the large, primarily white universities. While many schools have established special programs for blacks, the admissions procedures used for these programs and for regular black admissions remain very traditional. Standardized tests and high school grades are widely used while extra-curricular activities, recommendations and interviews are less used in black admissions. While many  schools are conducting research on black admissions there is little reason to expect that admissions policies towards blacks in predominantly white schools will change in the near future. It is proposed that research on black admissions should involve novel approaches to developing predictors and criteria rather than to apply white culturally-bound variables to groups of blacks. Potentially useful variables in predicting the academic success of blacks include a positive self-concept and low conformity. (Author)",

The ideal training format for organizational innovation would require selecting, assembling, protecting, and encouraging people, from both within and outside the institution, who are best equipped to initiate, plan for, and evaluate change. Thus, supervisors and decision-makers must be prepared to accept participation in change-design from all ranks of employees, which may include members of indigenous user populations and minority group members. Organizations should be especially alert to the potential contributions of social service user populations whose individuals may function as staff members, paid consultants, or advisors.  Motivational framework should incorporate intrinsic rewards that come from individual effectiveness in creatively responding to social needs. The university could serve as a catalyst for this type of change-design by setting up model training programs and developing ways of overcoming status, social class and rank differentials which can either inhibit or enhance creativity and innovation.

        "description":"This evaluation is focused on the actual operation and results of five decentralized projects. The following criteria were used in the selection of the specific projects examined: the projects would represent different categories of programs, different geographical areas of New York City, and different allocations in amount of the total budget. The general goals of the evaluation were to obtain a detailed description of the project from the Title I and project coordinators, and a measure of pupil performance when pupil performance or behavior was involved, to ascertain the opinions and attitudes of teachers, paraprofessional staff, parents of children involved in the projects, and local community representatives regarding each project. Projects examined were: &quot;Diagnostic and  Remedial Learning Laboratory,&quot;&quot;Cultural Heritage Implementation Program,&quot;&quot;Motivation in Learning,&quot;&quot;Parental Involvement in Language Arts and Reading Improvement for Grades 1-3,&quot; and &quot;Closed Circuit Television and Video Tape Recording.&quot; Findings indicated generally positive results in all projects except the TV Videotape teacher training project, which faltered due to mechanical and administrative problems. Recommendations include those of allotment of more time for planning, creation of another position of Title I coordinator, and more intensive efforts to involve community representatives. Appended are samples of questionnaire and interview forms, materials used, and records of some of the responses. (RJ)",

The source of the scale was the finding by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders and other researchers that there was a consistent hierarchy of grievances in every major city surveyed. These grievances are believed to be strongly related to the attitudes held by blacks and whites in relation to each other. Using this information and the suggestions from personnel of the Urban Adult Education Institute and the Foundation for Racial Equality in Memory of Martin Luther King, Jr., in Detroit, scales were constructed dealing with seven attitude content areas identified as being of crucial importance for interracial  interaction. These scales and other psychological measures were then administered to two populations of college students. The final composite scale was found useful for assessing racial attitudes. Additionally, it was found that a person's racial attitudes could be predicted. [Because of size of the print, tables 3 and 8 may not be clearly readable in hard copy reproduction.] (JM)",

A stratified random sample by father's occupation was made of families of secondary school male graduates and dropouts in Ontario. Visits to the home were conducted by one experimenter who followed a systematic routine. Each session required about two to three hours in order to gather the sets of data which consisted of: questionnaires; five stories written by each boy in response to five Thematic Apperception Test-like pictures which were used to obtain a measure of achievement motivation; and, a tape-recorded discussion between the mother-father-son over issues  about which participants had indicated opinion differences in response to the questionnaire. It was concluded that the more highly educated mothers of the graduates may have been able to establish for their sons optimum conditions for inculcating both achievement motivation and achievement-related values. It is suggested that there is a need for studies that will make operational the intervening linkages between family structure, adolescent personality, and school behavior postulated in this study.

The program attempted to improve the achievement level of primary grade pupils by introducing reduced class ratios, paraprofessional assistance, and provision of additional instructional materials. Investigation of the extent to which the prescribed organizational framework was implemented revealed a low degree of accomplishment. Limitations of classroom space and difficulties in recruiting educational assistants severely handicapped organizational plans. The allocation of additional instructional materials was not received by two-thirds of the schools questioned. Subsidiary  features of the program encompassing the area of related services, nutritional, dental, medical, psychological and social services, and parental involvement, received recognition only in the project proposal. No budget or guidelines were formulated for these components. Any inference s as to the effect of the program on academic achievement are very tentative due to the shortened school year, nonrandom assignment of pupils to program variants, limited implementation of the program, and the high rate of teacher and pupil mobility.

Other limitations were that the range of school inputs were confined to those present in the schools surveyed and that no indication was given as to whether the educational investment was worthwhile. It is also argued that educational change should be aimed at eliminating poverty and that lifetime income gain resulting from learning gain should be greater than costs of producing that change. Lifetime income gain criterion, it is held, can be measured in four steps: (1) using standardized tests to measure how much extra learning takes place as a result of a given educational change; (2) calculating the yearly equivalent learning gain; (3)  calculating direct income return to the individual who attends school one year longer by comparing lifetime income histories of individuals with different years of schooling; and (4) calculating estimated income gain derived from learning change by multiplying percentage of a year's worth of learning by lifetime income return associated with an extra year of education.

For example, a dart throwing game was used to reduce anxiety about test-taking and to illustrate the game aspects of testing. Rapport between tester and testees was encouraged by having the tester also conduct training sessions. Students were also given time to become familiar with test facilities, tests, and equipment in addition to experience with taking short timed tests. Sequential instruction helped  students become familiar with simple non-standardized tests and procedures through the standardized tests used by the Employment Service. Although no evaluation design has been developed to measure results, it is assumed that, through reduction of anxiety, development of test-taking skills, and improved motivation and attitudes toward testing, the trainee would improve his test scores.

Results of these interviews showed that the school and teachers were by and large rated adequate but that some teachers (generally classified as \"bad teachers\") lacked knowledge of how to deal with students and that course content was often irrelevant and uninteresting. Students expressed a desire for new programs that would help them find jobs and develop a self-identity. Questions on educational and occupational aspirations revealed that graduation from high school and acquisition of  semi-professional and professional occupational status was not associated with regular attendance, and that students' occupational aspiration levels were not realistically adjusted to their plans for furthering their education. Students saw lack of needed courses as the greatest obstacle to finishing high school. Data suggests that counselors should spend more time discussing the relevance of school to careers. (KG)",

Since the Nova Plan is essentially a trial combination of these separate innovations it was evaluated as a whole. The evaluation can be characterized as a causal-comparative study in which changes over two-year periods in the achievement and school related attitudes of two sequential sets of Nova students were compared with changes in the achievement and attitudes of students from other county schools. A crucial finding of the first year of operations was that the Nova Plan could not be  implemented under the conditions of an overcrowded school plant, or even under an enrollment based on the ratio approaching but one seat per student per instructional unit. The problems surveys indicated an acute lack of effective vertical lines of communication between teachers and administrators, and of horizontal lines within faculty and administration separately.

This model may be used to assist individuals, and the society, to become more aware of the effects that social practices have on the immediate and long-term actions of others. A social reinforcement system is operationally defined as those sociological forces, positive or negative, which influence the sociability of an individual by causing him to establish a systematic network of possible alternatives to a given social stimulus such that he may continually perceive his actions as positive reinforcements which maintain his internal security or stability. The socio-psychophysiological model is an  extension of the stimulus-reaction mechanism where the multiple effect of SRS acts as the vehicle through which social behavior is conditioned. Neuro- and psycho-physiological factors are expressed as components in the internal status mechanism of the SPPM. (JM)",

The data used to estimate this system were derived from the Equal Opportunity Survey on which the Coleman Report was based. The sample is composed of sixth grade students in a large eastern city who had attended only the school in which they were enrolled at the time of the survey, 1965-66. Teacher characteristics are based upon averages for all the teachers in each school who were  teaching in grades three to five. Since both explanatory variables and those which are going to be explained are interdependent, their values must be solved simultaneously in order to obtain unbiased estimates of their effects. The findings indicate that educational programs focusing on student attitudes may be able to compensate for &quot;disadvantages&quot; in socioeconomic background. (JM)",

Teacher performance indicators appear more relevant for judging teacher effectiveness than certification, education, and experience. Teacher effects may well be seriously underestimated if achievement data are first calibrated for student socioeconomic status, as the present rudimentary state of our quantitative models does not permit us to disentangle the effects of home, school, and peers on students' achievement. Although many investigators believe that teachers may be the most important factor in educational achievement for most children, that belief rests largely  on judgment and does not give us any clue as to how it operates. Without that, it is not of much use for policy formulation or administrative practice. We absolutely must pin down the connections between the inputs and the outputs of education; without that kind of theoretical structure we can flounder indefinitely in our efforts to improve the process.

        "description":"This follow-up study aimed to determine whether a similar relationship between anxiety in the school situation and racial-socioeconomic status in upper elementary school children could be found in an expanded population. A population of 1201 fifth- and sixth-grade children from eight schools representing various combinations of urban-suburban, private-public, inner-outer city, and racial compositions were given a \"General Anxiety Questionnaire.\" In addition, IQ, achievement gains, and teacher ratings of pupil behavior were used in this study. Results show that black inner city children do manifest a higher anxiety level than white children. Researchers argue that this anxiety is rooted in unmet physical and security needs in the inner city environment. Thus, a relationship can be  established between social-emotional cognitive structures and racial-socioeconomic situations.

        "description":"This article reviews research from the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's on the effects of discrimination on blacks. Data from these studies indicate that adverse cultural restrictions have fostered a unique and distinctive black personality. Among traits identified are: a negative or inferior self-image, pessimism about the future, attachment to the group, and an intense need among adolescents to appear in a personally favorable light. Geographical location was found to be a significant variable in anxiety over self identity. Discrimination on the basis of color was found to be most detrimental to the black's sense of dignity and integrity. A pessimistic philosophy, high aspiration level, and low frustration tolerance define the core conflicts of the black personality. A study (Goff,  1949) of the perceptions and attitudes of upper and lower income New York City children and adults showed that Negro-white relationships, ridicule, radio and movie stereotypes, aggression from white children, and physical abuse from white adults rated as the most difficult experiences. Victimization is seen responsible for negative attitudes and skepticism over American ideals. (KG)",

        "description":"This paper explores behavior patterns of lower class black adolescents and contends that their seemingly illogical and irrational behavior is, in fact, meaningful and utilitarian within the context of their environments. The effects of social and residential segregation and the lack of stable social institutions reinforce strong feelings of group isolation and enhance peer group pressure. Behaviors should be seen as adaptations to frustrations of exclusion and symptomatic of the need for new forms of social organization, novel social practices, and self-identity. Thus, rejection of middle class work styles and time orientation reflect the adolescent's need to avoid confronting the humiliating realities of low-paying menial jobs. Moreover, in a social milieu which does not  sanction present sacrifices for future rewards, pleasure-seeking activities are not only encouraged but offer a defiant alternative to middle class values. Verbal games such as \"the dozens\" and \"signifying\" provide an avenue for manipulating peers and achieving a sense of adequacy. \"Soul,\" the opposite of white hypocrisy and phoniness, gives the black a sense of group cohesiveness and superiority over his oppressor.

        "description":"This report discusses the practical problems encountered in a longitudinal study now in its fourth year, where the focus has been the early identification of later learning disorders. The general goal was the identification of tests with the characteristics of high reliability, low cost, short time to administer, low demand on scoring sophistication, and which could be given in group form by the classroom teacher. A number of instruments which had to be administered individually were tried. If they met other criteria then whether they could be either converted into group-administered tests, or whether paraprofessionals could successfully administer them was considered. Three major sources of unreliability were found, including instruments previously reported as reliable: examiner  reliability, scoring reliability, and reliability of interpretation of differences. The vocabulary subtest of the Wechslar Intelligence Scale for Children, as improved by Jastak and Jastak, is held to have so far been proven the best single subtest predictor. The visual sequential memory subtest of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Ability (ITPA) was found to predict first grade achievement more powerfully than the total ITPA plus the Stanford-Binet IQ Test.

Four years of research on behaviors useful in educational diagnosis and prediction of future success revealed two tests highly related to the achievement goals of the first grade; these are knowledge of vocabular and visuoperceptual memory. Screening is the program's first phase: the second is establishment of intervention strategies with regard to children diagnosed as highly susceptible to academic failure. The lowest children were initially treated individually by paraprofessionals trained to be instructional aides. Academic materials were often presented in a gamelike  format to provide continuing reinforcement of learning. Techniques with a lower cost per pupil were selected for learning enhancement at other levels. These included cassette programming, the training of individual classroom teachers in behavior modification, the modification of the curriculum format, and the active involvement of parents in their children's education.

The laboratory was a room equipped with designated learning centers and the lab team consisted of a teacher, an aide, and a part-time psychologist. The students were scheduled in groups of eight to ten to receive individually prescribed instruction for six minutes each day. A multi-media approach was used and instruction was aimed at the development of skills in listening, writing, speaking, and arithmetic computation, conceptualization and application. A control group matched for sex, mental ability, achievement levels, and participation in remedial programs received regular classroom  instruction. Analyses of data made at the end of each of the three years did not indicate that the special treatment had any significantly positive effect on achievement as measured by the instruments used. Conclusions drawn suggest that the experimental approach employed came too late in the students' school experience. (FL)",

Factor results used for this illustration are the reanalyses of the data of nine of the Guilford studies as previously reported by one of these authors. The number of comparable common factors for the data in any one of the matrices is always considerable fewer than the number of common factors obtained by Guilford. A few of the CCF's agree rather closely with common  factors obtained by Guilford. In many instances two or more of Guilford's common factors coalesce into one comparable common factor. (Author/FL)",

Two experiments were run. The first experiment considered the differential effects on short-and long-term retention of expository versus discovery methods of presenting the concepts. The second experiment investigated differential effects on immediate acquisition and transfer, of expository versus discovery methods of presenting the concepts. The results of these experiments showed that method of  presentation did not differentially affect either immediate acquisition or transfer, but did differentially affect retention of the material in favor of th students who received lessons in the discovery mode.

The procedure used required the students to specify a degree of belief probability for each of the given alternatives to a question. The students were given a multiple-choice item and asked to specify what they believed to be the probability of correctness of each choice. The initial intent of these experiments was to see if a  non-standard test-taking and scoring procedure would provide useful, reliable information for such tests. The studies indicated that the problem of getting useful, reliable information on difficult tests has not been solved. (Author/FL)",

Even good lectures, and most discussion classes, result in the student acting as a passive observer, never establishing an individual relationship to the subject matter. If history teachers were to see their objective as making historians out of students, rather than creating knowing minds, they could help create independent minds capable of critical thinking, and an appreciation of the values of history. This methodological approach involves permitting students to do, on their own, what historians do--deciding what questions are worth answering,  securing information from many sources; and critically evaluating those sources of information. While Latin American history is not under direct attack, it is not unaffected by the current crisis in history teaching. Unless instruction is personalized and aimed at teaching the historical skills, history will not be able to justify its existence in the curriculum. (JLB)",

Inductive methods are stressed in descriptions of learning situations showing relatedness between teacher purpose; pupil purpose; learning activities; accumulation of related sets of facts; concepts; subgeneralizations; major generalizations. In the last two chapters consideration is given to learner characteristics and reasonable cognitive and behavioral objectives for the  primary and intermediate grade child. A multidimensional study of home and community stressing generalizations about human interdependence is recommended for the primary level. For the intermediate grades, it is suggested that an in-depth, laboratory study of a particular culture can, when organized on the above principles, encourage children to better understand their own environment and to gain insights into the relatedness of school curriculum to problems of personal and social significance.

The inservice program described is being carried out by the Center for Teaching International Relations (CTIR), an organizational unit of the Graduate School of International Studies, Denver University (DU). (Other CTIR programs are also listed.) The inservice programs take three forms: 1) extended inservice institutes at DU, offering graduate credit, at which participants develop classroom-oriented materials in international affairs; 2) 3-day regional institutes throughout Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico, at which  participants are introduced to CTIR classroom materials; and, 3) 2 to 3 day national institutes. The short-term institutes use &quot;Rowan and Martin's 'Laugh-In' format&quot; as a planning model. &quot;The objective was to provide the participant with ideas, materials, and even units which were ready for the classroom.&quot; (A typical schedule of these is included and described.) Institute staff members were primarily discipline-oriented professors who generally lacked formal secondary teaching experience. (DJB)",

The purpose of the interdisciplinary program is to provide learning experiences that will lead to the development of self and effective human relationships in a democratic society. The program is planned as a total sequence so that learning is developmental and cumulative. Elements of the program include: curriculum design, instructional resources and physical facilities, and professional growth and development of teachers. The broad theme for the elementary grades is &quot;Man and His World&quot; which is designed to develop cross cultural understandings. As an integral part of the objectives, children learn and apply  processes of critical analysis and concept formation, and values that lead to interpersonal skill development and effective citizenship. The secondary program summary includes brief descriptions for: 11 courses in American Studies; 6 courses in World Studies; and advanced Social Science Problems course in the techniques of investigation and inquiry; and, 5 introductory courses in: anthropology, economics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. Appendices include: State Board of Education policy, and legal provisions. (SBE)",

This paper briefly reviews research projects in this area started in 1964 by Field Enterprises Educational Corporation and continued through 1967. In summary, this work has provided two major things: 1) it has shown the inadequacy of existing research relating to children and their characteristics as map users, and of the theoretical framework in which the research has been done; and, 2) it has provided an approach to map design that consists essentially of matching an intellectual array of map use tasks to  a visual array of graphic elements.

Nine innovative practices that may indicate the nature of educational change in the 1970's were selected from the many excellent projects in New England. Each State Department of Education was requested to submit projects for consideration. The criteria for selection by the assessment committees included: evidence of deliberate planning, an awareness of existing programs, utilization of resource people, efficiency, nature of the change, potential impact of the strategies on the recipients, and the probability of adoption. These have been carefully examined by qualified teams.  On-site project visitation and intensive group and individual interviews were used to gather data on each project from project directors, administrators, teachers, and pupils in each school visited. Studies by Richard Carlson and Owen Kieman, and Henry Brickell on educational change processes were used as guides. The projects are described and evaluated in this report as a resource for those concerned with innovations in school administration and organization, curriculum, and the use of technology in the classroom.

The most significant findings were: the dominant educational intentions and cultural orientations of large numbers of teachers may be identified and analyzed; and, that these categories proved to be more strongly related to classroom practices and student achievement than any other factor.

Breakdown points are discussed. Adoption or change efforts should be based on principles supported by research to maximize diffusion and make early adopters aware of a program or product through their most used sources of information: newsletters, conferences, convention section meetings. Effort also should be made to encourage small trial programs and emphasize the better job being done through the innovation. With a complex unit or course widespread trial of a four-day unit that requires few changes in teacher behavior is most effective. Materials should be devised so that they can be adapted or finished at  the local level and a feedback system included. Early adopters should be trained to test the innovation and to install it for others on a trial basis. (VLW)",

        "description":"Education, according to various established criteria, can be classified as an industry, and in many African nations, it is the largest industry. Yet, when judged by standard measures of industrial success, such as whether the economic outcomes justify the amount spent, the answer is generally no. The thesis that most African nations are attempting to educate too many students too fast at too high a cost can be supported by a consideration of the economic, political and social consequences of these actions. For example, the location of schools in highly developed areas, which is dictated by the lack of transportation facilities, results in an increased educational gap between urban and rural population; large financial deficits have accrued in attempting to meet the projected  educational expansion; African cities are flooded with unemployed primary and secondary graduates. Measures which may be politically unpopular will have to be implemented to make education in Africa a productive enterprise, such as tailoring the curriculum to the needs of an agricultural nation; consider shifting financial allotments from education to industry in order to provide jobs; limiting educational opportunity.

        "description":"Can a structure be created that provides a broader and more valid base for the general education curriculum in the social studies than would the structure of social science disciplines? One alternative would be to focus on the making of decisions about public issues as the crucial element of citizenship behavior in a democracy. Using the common threefold defintion, the structure would involve: 1) subject or field --making and affecting policy decisions in this society; 2) substantive concepts --those useful in describing and understanding the issues and the context in which decisions about them must be made; and, 3) syntactical or methodological concepts --those useful in arriving at rationally justified policy decisions. The social sciences have much to contribute to  understanding crucial issues, but so do ethics, logic, and the humanities. In addition, some research evidence suggests that concepts will be better retained and more readily transferred to the non-classroom public controversy setting if the relevance of the concepts to handling an array of issues important to the society and to the student is made clear. It is clear that a citizenship education curriculum must be based on more than the structure of the social sciences, and must be developed at a level above that of the individual course.

The questions considered are 1) What changes in teacher aspirations and values are brought about by advanced education? and 2) To what extent does advanced education facilitate the achievement of socially and professionally rewarding objectives? Chapter 2 sets out the methods used in the study, and Chapter 3 introduces the data on which it is based. Chapters 4 - 8 explore data collected by the Institute of Administrative Research, Teachers College, Columbia University. Chapter 9 deals with the 1962 postcensal survey of professional and  technical manpower, to amplify the findings of the present study, and Chapter 10 summarizes the findings from both sets of data. Chapter 11 reviews the implications of the study and provides two broad conclusions: 1) Graduate educational requirements may work in some ways to reduce the effectiveness of the teaching force; and 2) More education does not automatically &quot;lock in&quot; a teacher either to a school system or to the teaching profession. The results cannot be interpreted as proving either that career change is detrimental or that increased career change is caused by additional education. (MBM)",

        "description":"A continuum of \"Protocols\" has been derived. By way of definition three elements of what might be called an \"instructional performance library\" are 1) a collection of \"protocol materials\" (audiovisual renderings of behavior that is engaged in by instructional personnel); 2) a catalog of \"protocols\" (ways to use the materials); and 3) a communications network which allows the library to grow and be self-sustaining. Since the protocols considered here use protocol materials, the continuum is best viewed as one of audiovisual protocols. It is helpful to envision the total teacher training process as a macrocosm in which are embedded specific protocols or ways of going about training instructional personnel. The simple continuum of protocols here suggested ranges from the relatively  unstructured to the highly structured: the illustrated lecture, large group, small group, brainstorming, buzz groups, standard supervisor-teacher relationship, collegial supervision, peer teaching, role playing, microteaching, mini-teaching, and model-making. This continuum is not completed or all-inclusive. The \"structure\" dimension is a complex one involving the amount, quality, and intensity of structure. The continuum also points up that structure carries comcomitant ramifications for administration, cost, and technical support systems.

(The summary is based on notes of Dr. David Krathwohl and Dr. Launor Carter who were group leaders; conference members met both as a whole and in small group sessions.) Major headings under which ideas are presented are 1) the need for a National Institute of Education (NIE) of the type proposed--to conduct and support research, encourage innovation, and disseminate significant findings throughout the nation; 2) considerations regarding the missions of the Institute; 3) need  for planning the Institute; 4) the implementation of NIE; 5) NIE program emphasis and functions; 6) NIE internal organization; 7) additional issues. It is concluded that the discussions raised more questions than they answered, but that the overall tone was hopeful that, given the needed resources of personnel, facilities, and hard cash, the Institute could become a key component in the educational research efforts of the seventies. Included are a list of conference participants and both bills proposing establishment of the Institute--91st Congress, 2nd Session, S. 3797 and H.R. 16262.

The limited number of followup studies in the area were reviewed as a first step, after which a four-page questionnaire was sent to as many of the 699 graduates from the period 1959 to 1969 as could be found. In analyzing the data, chi square analyses were used to determine if there were significant differences among observed and expected frequencies in the graduates' evaluation of their courses; simple frequencies were used for the remainder of the data. The findings showed no significant differences among observed and expected frequencies between the specified year divisions in 13 of the 116 topics.  Other indications were that there is a definite trend toward continuing education after graduating; that 68 percent of the respondents still live in Kentucky; and that 71 percent continue to teach. The author feels that it is significant that approximately 56 percent of those responding to the relevant question did not suggest any courses that should or could be eliminated from the program.

In one year the project was able to noticeably alter the educational philosophy of the system and to make teachers more aware of individual needs.

The experimental design used subjects as their own controls on repeated measures across the three conditions (three 2-week phases) of baseline reinforcement, and return-to-baseline. Statistical and descriptive analyses were conducted on the data (oral reading rates for both tasks across the three experimental conditions). Results were consistent with those found in previous studies using reinforcement procedures in that performance was significantly  increased (p&lt;.05) on both tasks under the reinforcing condition. The return to baseline condition produced differential effects as a function of tasks; these results were considered to be an effect of the difference in reinforcement available in the extra-experimental environment of the two tasks. There were no differences found in retention across the conditions after retention scores were corrected for acquisition. When results were examined as a function of IQ and baseline performance changes (p&lt;.01) across conditions. (Implications for classroom instruction and further research are suggested.

Subjects were six biology teachers and their high ability students using the Biological Science Curriculum Study (BSCS).  Discussion sessions of each class were recorded for three consecutive days while the teacher was introducing the subject of photosynthesis. Each script was divided and classified by two staff members independently. Significant differences were found between teachers in goals and levels dimensions but not in style. Teachers talked most, but with substantial differences between teachers in terms of amount of student talk allowed. Those students showing greatest degree of verbal expression (more boys than girls) also showed greater proficiency according to grades and tests.

Conclusions were: 1) Ohio is likely to have an oversupply of \"regular\" elementary teachers in the next decade. 2) The introduction of upper division programs should thus be undertaken only to improve the quality of teacher preparation and to establish a better statewide distribution of opportunity for it. 3) The quality of training can probably be improved through development of such branch programs because they would permit greater student- faculty contact and greater program individualization, encourage creative and  innovative training designs, generate extensive field experience components, and provide for preparation of specialist elementary teachers (on main campuses whose enrollment of \"regular\" trainees could be reduced). 4) Necessary components for a branch program would include 125 full-time-equivalent upper division students, a four-to five-member professional staff, and appropriate library, classroom and field experience facilities. The order of priority recommended for branches satisfying these criteria is Stark, Ashtabula, Firelands, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Mansfield, Lima, Chillicothe, and Zanesville. Each third and fourth year program is expected to increase public operating expenses by at least $123,000 per year. (JS)",

Because of the age and needs of undergraduates and the background of college professors, colleges neither help practicing teachers nor prepare undergraduates to enter teaching and to be effective in situations where they are needed. Public schools cannot control teacher preparation either; they can only condition people to cope. Only a new kind of institution, e.g., the cooperative center, can include the necessary components of a sound program: a sequence of field experiences beginning with actual tutoring, then assisting, interning, and finally observing; clinical  personnel who actually perform as well as verbalize what they do as teacher educators; preparation of people in cross roles, learning role relationships and expectations during preparation; coordination between industry, schools, professional associations, community agencies, and state departments in a redistribution of power which breaks the axis between colleges and state departments; career-long affiliation between teachers and universities with education of teachers in groups; \"selection\" process based on first-year performance; preparation of teachers for various teaching functions; and a flexible behavioral approach as opposed to \"courses.\" Students, unions, and community will all gain more control.

The first half (text section) has three parts. Part 1 includes rationale for educational laboratory experiences and discussion of student, administrator, and classroom teacher roles. Part 2 deals with methods, models, and techniques. Its main chapter advances an instructional model of seven main components: social system, entering behavior assessment, specification of behavioral objectives, learning unit and procedures, presenting learning units, student performance, and feedback and assessment. Other chapters offer suggestions for ways trainees may use the models for data collection and information gathering and  discuss guidelines for critical assessment of teaching behavior. The five chapters in Part 3 describe types of experiences for moving trainees into direct contact with teaching-learning situations: September Experience, Teacher Aide Experience, Elementary Block Program, Secondary Laboratory Experiences. The second half (appendixes--perforated for easy removal) contains guides for assessing and practicing appropriate teaching behavior. Included are observation guides, checklists, and evaluation forms for each type of laboratory experience and for instructional analysis and planning, e.g., interaction analysis tally sheet and matrixes, lesson plan outlines, Laboratory Experience Rating Scale.

The definition set forth is this: &quot;'Paraprofessional' denotes that segment of auxiliary personnel working directly with professional educators to assist them in discharging their professional duties&quot; (includes teacher aides, lay readers, and instructional aides).  The needs of the group are stated to include identification of roles and responsibilities in relation to the professional educator, preservice and inservice training programs for all personnel involved in paraprofessional programs, and establishment of an organizational structure related to the united teaching profession to meet their economic and organizational needs. Recommendations focus on expansion of the NEA/ACT auxiliary personnel program to give it the status of division or section within NEA.

Focus is on the teaching process in its direct relation to skill strengths and weaknesses of each child. A curriculum was developed by selected school staff and consultants, specifying behavioral objectives for reading, comprehension, and mathematics. From this curriculum an assessment instrument was constructed that could identify strengths and weaknesses of each child in basic skill areas, spot interests, and place each child clearly in a curricular sequence of basic skills. First assessment of 2,500 elementary children in six schools was  conducted in fall 1969 by 15 teacher trainers and 60 parents (paraprofessionals) trained in 2 days to administer the instrument and analyze the record results for feedback to teachers showing where each child fit into the curriculum sequence. Then each school began special inservice training sessions and new educational programs to help the teachers and paraprofessionals maximize their abilities, use of materials, assessment information on the children, and the new curriculum. Assessment of children will take place three times a year with subsequent feedback to teachers, administrators, and parents for adjustment of instructional training and programing based on the objective data on each child's performance.

The introduction further points out that 1) Participating in these activities should increase the likelihood that children will feel comfortable and will respond vocally and enthusiastically during subsequent systematic instruction in speaking and listening to  standard English. 2) There is development from teacher-led to pupil-led activities and from almost no dependence on verbal instruction to preliminary testing for such dependence, while the focus is on other kinds of behavior, e.g., participating with and before the group, imitating the teacher. 3) When pre-lessons were pilot tested in spring 1968 with six groups of children, trials confirmed that a teacher could conduct them effectively with almost no preparation. 4) Though designed for use with the Oral Language Program (see SP 004 400 and SP 004 386), they may be used prior to beginning other oral language instructional programs as well.

Subjects were two fourth grade teachers who wore electronic earphone speakers in their social studies classes. One, with 12 years experience, taught geography to each class separately in daily 30-minute periods; the other, with one year experience, taught history to the classes twice weekly for 20-minute periods. Classes were tape recorded for one week to obtain a baseline sample of question strategies. For the 3-week intervention phase teachers were told that when they set up a situation which encouraged the children to use higher level thought processes, that was good, and they would be signaled. Feedback was immediately provided for all  questions above the knowledge category (based on Bloom's taxonomy). After 3 weeks of post-experiment recording without feedback, tapes were analyzed for questioning strategy. Data indicated that both teachers increased their use of high order questions to an acceptable level (a marked change in the desired direction) which continued during the post-test probes. Results suggest that electronic training techniques could economically and effectively supplement the usual student experience and could be used with experienced classroom teachers for skill enhancement.

Included are reports from 1) five systems in which some teachers in one or more schools have given their students the opportunity to evaluate them; 2) 19 systems where teachers in one or more schools have been permitted to evaluate their principals;  3) three systems which submitted forms used by principals to evaluate central office personnel and services (in one of these districts teachers also evaluate central office subject-matter coordinators and directors); and 4) four school system evaluation programs developed and administered by universities. The evaluation forms used by each are included along with information on the frequency of evaluation and use and disposition of forms. A bibliography lists 45 items under &quot;Rating of Teachers by Students&quot; and three under &quot;Rating of Principals by Teachers.&quot; (JS)",

The Oral Language Program (OLP) is directed at providing non-English speaking youngsters with a fluent, independent speaking ability in English and with facility in understanding spoken English considered prerequisite to formal reading instruction. It is designed for use daily by one teacher with groups of about 10 children (age 5-7) in 25-minute lessons. There is emphasis on games involving questions and answers, handling of objects, and other motor activities. Throughout, the teacher models utterances, elicits responses, provides corrective feedback, and reinforces  student participation. Components include notebooks of lesson plans (147 plans), separate &quot;pre-lessons,&quot; a teacher's manual, drawings and recording for use with lessons, tests, and sample &quot;cultural heritage&quot; lesson plans for relating materials to pupil ethnic background.

The objectives were to increase competence in understanding and applying multidimensional scaling techniques with particular emphasis on their use in solving problems of motivation and perception in the typical educational environment, in studying values about education, and in teaching others the most effective scaling techniques. Long program was essentially an internship involving many individual seminars. Long term results will be measured by  the kind and quality of research produced in the future.

The institute curriculum covered four broad areas: 1) the research proposal and report, 2) curriculum research and development, 3) curriculum evaluation paradigms and procedures, and 4) techniques for analyzing and interpreting experimental data. Training proceeded primarily by means of a series of instructional packages developed by the Southwest Regional Laboratory as part of their Staff Development Compendium.

The Bureau of Research administered the program for the department. The two interrelated purposes of the program were to contribute to the training of educational research-related personnel, and to gain meaningful assistance from the research interns in furthering the research and development activities of the department. The training program included assigning interns to practice-oriented research tasks compatible with their professional interest and/or needs and conducting bi-weekly seminars designed to assist their professional growth. During the program period, nine intern positions were  created and funded and 14 graduate students at Michigan State University participated in the program. Interns worked up to 20 hours per week and at the same time continued their graduate education program. Evaluation of the program demonstrated that the program was successful and contributed meaningfully to the two objectives. Four research interns from the 1969-70 program period are now employed as full-time personnel in the Department of Education. The program was worthwhile and effective in meeting both the needs of the interns and of the department. (Author/MBM)",

The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) and the California F Scale were administered to 100 education students to determine attitudes and degree of authoritarianism. Then selected statements from the MTIA were used as conclusions for syllogisms constructed for the Syllogism Test, which was administered before and after programed instruction in judging the validity of conclusions. Findings indicated that subjects high in authoritarianism make more attitude errors in reasoning. Programed instruction reduces attitude errors in reasoning for both high and  low authoritarians, with the reduction being significantly greater for high authoritarians. These findings have implications for developing self-awareness of the part of the teacher in order to provide a logical rather than emotional response to difficult classroom situations. (RT)",

In an effective ungraded program, the student chooses his own subject matter and is placed and graded according to his own learning rate and achievement level. More than 25 ungraded programs in high school English across the United States were observed first-hand to discover such innovations as teacher-pupil contracts, pre-written units called Learning Activity Packages, individualized instruction, and student options of traditional or innovative courses. After evaluating  them all, it was decided that the ungraded English program which structures courses on phase levels and requires the student to follow a certain sequence in selecting his courses would best encourage the personal initiative and infinite potential of both student and faculty.

Two studies were used in order to provide independently derived results which could be compared. In the first study, 49 undergraduate public-speaking students judged 6 speeches using both a modified Baird-Knower rating scale and an objective comprehension test. Approximately half of the subjects listened to audio tapes of the speeches and half to video tapes with four of the six speeches used for final analysis. In the second study, 1190 students in 54 basic speech classes each judged one speech using five rating scales and a three-item comprehnsion test. Results from these studies indicated  that (1) relationships among ratings on individual scales were high, (2) comprehension measures correlated to a modest degree (first investigation only), and (3) neglibible relationships existed between ratings and comprehension scores. These findings suggest that rating scales and comprehension scores are not measuring the same degrees and forms of speaker effectiveness. (JM)",

Three types of visual studies--walking tours, classroom art work, study trips to an art museum--and a group of related art concepts served as an organizing framework for teachers in planning curriculum and instruction. A new approach to evaluation of art through the use of photography was developed and tested. Each child was asked to take three shots of an object during the school year to see if learning would carry over and influence what they did in the way of selecting and positioning objects they chose to photograph. Results indicated  that the use of photography as an evaluation technique is sound, and is of particular value for children who have had limited environmental enrichment.

The present study attempts to develop a classification system (Taxonomy of Administrative Information Needs) to help evaluators and administrators anticipate information needs related to the decision making process. According to the taxonomy, an evaluation team assists the administrator by examining the target, general policies, objectives, program, resources, schedules, and program policy for internal and external inconsistencies or problems. The taxonomy suggests that information relevant to a decision may include the effects desired, changes suggested, strategies others have used, etc. The earlier classification system for decision  situations and the Taxonomy of Administrative Information Needs should greatly facilitate the work of evaluation teams by providing pertinent information related to decision making. There is still, however, little direct help for the evaluator in determining where and how to gather information. Additional research and development in these areas as well as testing and refining of the proposed taxonomy and classification system is needed.

For a suppressor so defined, formal identities are shown with part, partial, and multiple correlational procedures. It is demonstrated that if maximum prediction is the primary goal, the use of the suppressor approach is appropriate if, and only if, the suppressor-criterion correlation is zero. Otherwise multiple correlation will always yield a higher validity. Mathematical constraints are shown to be operating on suppressors with a resultant effect of producing minimal incremental validity for suppressors within the range of typical validity coefficients. It is also demonstrated that additional  predictors will yield a greater increment in prediction in comparison with suppressors. On the other hand, because of its conceptual advantages, the formally equivalent part correlation is recommended over the multiple correlation approach for suppressor variables which enter into theoretical relationships and for the measurement of latent constructs.

Tests have been used to achieve optimum use of resources rather than optimum development of the individual. Or, they have been used to predict a child's achievement rather than to identify his learning difficulties. This latter use would indicate when and where intervention in the child's educational experience might be successful in changing his predicted score. Predicted scores can also be changed by training individuals to take tests successfully. The use of test scores to measure abilities relevant to the skills required for a given occupation is considered. Finally, numerous suggestions are made which would aid counselors in fulfilling their responsibilities. These include providing the individual  with information concerning agencies and organizations which could help him improve in areas where deficient, and with adequate and comprehensible data aiding him to make decisions that are correct for him, based on his values and goals and not merely on test scores and resulting predictions. The recent growth of vocational technical institutions provides an alternative to the pressures for conformity that result in so many students attending four-year colleges when they would prefer some other type of education.

Language testing is needed as a criterion of the efficacy of teaching. Consideration of the curriculum and analysis of the texts used would aid in test construction. A discussion of the design and content of language tests and a detailed summary of their subject-matter is provided. This study employed a battery constructed on the basis of Lado's theory regarding the relationship between language variables and integrated skills. Factor analysis of the resulting data produced a factor structure which included knowledge of vocabulary, structure pronunciation, intelligence, and language fluency.

A battery of tests designed to measure a wide range of functions was administered to all eighth grade students, average age 15, in schools for the deaf in Sweden. All tests, with the exception of those intended to measure verbal ability, were nonverbal. Results from the factor analyses showed that whether the tests were speeded or non-speeded influenced the factor structure. Separate analyses of the boys' and girls' results revealed considerable differences in factor patterns, thus suggesting essential differences in the ability structures. For the girls there seemed to be a strong bond between verbal,  numerical, and reasoning tests, and for the boys a corresponding bond between spatial, numerical, and reasoning tests. Comparisons of the results for these deaf groups and those typical of normal subjects are noted. It is suggested that if teaching in schools for the deaf were supplemented with more concrete, manipulative materials and visual aids, problem-solving and mathematical ability in deaf students could be more highly developed.

A comparison sample of prekindergarten white middle class children was included to evaluate the age norms on a culturally typical sample of children and to assess performance on the Binet as it might relate to cultural differences. The analyses required that the items be arranged in order of difficulty and then examined for the degree to which the reordered items appear in their assigned age groups. Similar analyses were conducted for all groups to determine variables due to sex and race differences. Results suggest that the age progression properties of the items are relatively consistent between lower and middle-class children, between  males and females of either SES, and between races among lower class children; however, the age-placements of many items on the 1960 revision appear inappropriate, although the negative influence of such items is distributed evenly over SES, race and sex.

This study tests whether similar findings would result from measures of developmental behavior. Accordingly, the developmental behavior of 159 culturally disadvantaged children (85 boys, 74 girls) was assessed by systematic interviewing of preschool and elementary school teachers using the Preschool Attainment Record (PAR). The children, enrolled in the Education Improvement Program (EIP) in Durham, North Carolina, were members of nine groups attending nursery, preschool, or ungraded primary school. Mean group ages ranged from 24.7 to 93.5 months. The results, by groups, are graphed and analyzed with respect to attainment age, attainment quotient, and the ambulation,  manipulation, rapport, communication, responsibility, information, ideation, and creativity subscales of the PAR. Scores on the PAR are also compared with group mean scores on age-appropriate IQ measures. A steady decline in the rate of achievement and noticeable sex differences in performance appear as age increases. The measure proved useful and informative for evaluation purposes in this education improvement program for the culturally disadvantaged. Replication of the study with the same group and comparison with control groups are recommended to check the reliability of the findings. (LR)",

The Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) was designed to provide researchers in Career development with a quick and convenient measure of a number of relatively independent personality variables, or needs. It gauges 15 such needs and provides measures of test consistency and profile stability. This study was designed to observe normative differences between groups previously given the EPPS (and reported in the research literature) and to ascertain if the EPPS normative group is representative of any population. Data were collected on previous studies, encompassing 24 male and 15 female groups, which reported means and standard deviations of sub-populations.  Multiple t-tests were run through computer analysis. The results suggest that the representativeness of the test manual norm group and the sensitivity of the scales are questionable and that further research on the schedule is warranted. Scale sensitivity and differentiation are considered in more detailed in part II of the paper. Autonomy, for both men and women, appears to contribute little to differentiating among groups, and hence, any time a group is found to differ from the norm on this scale, they can be said to be really different. Problems related to such use of the EPPS and which require further research are raised. (Author/PR)",

The detailed interaction pattern was subject to a parallel &quot;micro-study&quot; of tape-recorded  lessons in mathematics from a sample of eight classes. Thus, the teachers' decisions and planning of lessons with respect to the students and the part of the curriculum under study were examined in detail.

An estimated 15% of elementary and secondary school students are reported to be handicapped in the area of reading. Early screening and matching of the learning ability of children with instructional programs holds promise to diminish school learning problems. From the beginning of formalized schooling, efforts have been made to analyze the task to reading. This task analysis has led from a visual or auditory approach to a meaning and code breaking approach. Most recently a model of perceptual characteristics of learners has been developed. A task-learner characteristic model is an attempt to generate a best-fit blend in instruction; that is, the learner and his  characteristics are blended in the most appropriate way with the task that he is to learn.

Criticisms of testing are delineated, including the discrimination implicit in normative testing itself and the application of resulting test scores. This criticism of measurement techniques has directed attention to other inequities in the educational system. Thus, the emergence of new educational techniques and related measurement techniques is a major force in educational reform, resulting in such innovations as new instructional techniques and curricula. Another important departure from standarized normative measures grows out of the increased concern for developing a national system of social indicators. One of the most significant changes in  the field of mental measurement in recent years is a recognition of social, cultural, and linguistic variability. In conclusion, it is noted that the electronic computer is necessary to the implementation of most of the new developments in measurement. A bibliography is included.

The items in the revised scale appear to fall into three main classes: (1) a failure syndrome, (2) involvement in  extracurricular activities, and (3) home background. Extensive reliability and validity studies on the revised scale are planned. A copy of the original 34-item scale is included. (Author/CK)",

Principal components analysis revealed Manual Dexterity, Finger Dexterity, Tweezer Dexterity and Spatial Relations as interpretable factors for both groups. Comparison of the factor patterns indicated that freshmen and seniors were least comparable on the Spatial Relations factors.

The identification of abilities that might underlie various readiness measures was of particular interest. The six instruments were administered to 218 first grade children representing a stratified sample of the socioeconomic make-up of three elementary schools in a southeastern city of 45,000 people. Four major factors were  isolated: Verbal-Conceptual, Auditory-Visual Association, Specific Readiness, and Specific Perceptual Organization. These results are discussed in terms of previous reading readiness research. It is concluded that there continues to be a need for investigations of reading readiness constructs with the goal of further isolating those factors which seem most critical to specific reading behaviors at particular points in the developmental sequence.

The specific purposes were to describe demographic and social-psychological characteristics of the population, as well as the population's perceptions and knowledge of health problems and facilities. The information was collected through interviews. A random sample of households was selected, and 108 interviews were completed (88 Negro and 20 white households). The Negro and Caucasian groups within the sample were shown to have rather different demographic characteristics; the Negro group, for example, was somewhat younger and slightly larger. The two groups were also found to report different patterns of health problems and treatment sought; the frequency of reported health  problems, for example, was higher for whites. In both groups, health problems were most frequently attributed to unknown causes. The treatment of choice was to consult a physician. Payment by the individual for treatment was more likely for those in higher occupational levels, from 20 to 40 years old, and Negroes. Behavior in response to perceived health problems can be viewed as reflective of the responses and alternatives available to people.

Students were selected from high schools in Hoboken and Newark, New Jersey, as well as from New York City. In conjunction with the high schools involved, STEP set up an intensive summer program at Stevens Institute of Technology, and followup programs during the academic year. Students continue in STEP until graduation, attending summer programs every year. The summer curriculum placed heavy emphasis on the development of mathematical, language, and laboratory skills. Through the rigorous academic schedule, educational field trips, and  living experience on campus, the students developed academic skills and self-awareness. As a result, the level of interest, involvement, and scholarship was very high. Because of the high level of academic proficiency demonstrated, academic credit may be awarded for satisfactory ratings. In three years, STEP has graduated 30 seniors, 25 of whom have become freshmen in college. None, or at best few, of these young men would have gone on to college if they were not in STEP.

In the five years since spring 1966, ESEA funds and programs have produced great variability in density of services, pupil-teacher ratios, curriculum materials, etc. In 1969-70, under new state guidelines, the following components were mandated, regardless of level: reading and mathematics instruction, auxiliary services (health, counseling, and attendance), parental involvement, intergroup relations, and staff development. Saturated services were the thrust, with the objective of providing as much ESEA intervention as possible for the disadvantaged. Guidelines for the school district mandated a per-capita expenditure for each child; projects  concentrated on the younger grades; teaching accountability became a common phrase; performance objectives entered the evaluation field; local-school principals had unprecedented autonomy in writing individual proposals for the educational program at their school; and, the community became more involved in education. Hard data from standardized achievement tests seemed to say that students were learning better than before; evaluative findings on other aspects of these programs are also considered encouraging.

These were: (1) that interpersonal attraction toward a black person will be correlated with the importance of the value, &quot;equality,&quot; and (2) that changes in the importance of the value, &quot;equality,&quot; will be accompanied by changes in interpersonal attraction toward a black person. Seventy-six white male and female undergraduates, half of whom received a procedure designed to increase the importance of the value &quot;equality&quot; ranked Rokeach's terminal values twice. Following the second administration of the value scale, the subjects engaged in a ten-minute conversation with a black person. Seven measures of interpersonal attraction--general liking, perceived value  similarity, perceived behavior similarity, eye contact, posture, head distance, and foot distance--were obtained from the interaction. Significant correlations were found between the ranking of &quot;equality&quot; and perceived value similarity, perceived behavior similarity, and eye contact. Also it was found that the group of subjects that received the value change procedure looked at the black person significantly more than did the group that did not receive this procedure.

While the situation was similar to that at other campuses in that drastic polarization and racial animosities were exacerbated, it was unique in one crucial aspect. Demonstrations at other colleges were generally directed toward creation of Black Studies programs and increased black student enrollment. The conflict at Queens, however, was about the way in which Operation SEEK, a remedial program for black students, was to be run. Perhaps for the first time, the principles of Black Power were being applied to preparing students from ghetto areas for college work. The tragedy of the situation was not property damage or the  breakdown of order, but that both sides developed such rigid positions that crucial educational issues were never really confronted. The academic establishment became highly emotional and was more concerned with its own standards than with the needs of the program, while the Coalition placed more emphasis on black ideology, and a precious opportunity was lost.

The white community at Queens reacted negatively towards SEEK students, faculty, and counseling staff. The frustration of the black and Puerto Rican community was the result of almost three years of coping with racism, budgetary mismanagement, and a dearth of black courses and teachers, and was aggravated by organizational changes which were seen as a move to destroy the SEEK program. This led to the formulation of the black and Puerto Rican Student-Faculty-Counselor Coalition. The Coalition outlined proposals designed to improve the quality of  education.

The Bank's Regional Economics Section inquired into various aspects of public education in New York City. While the study is considered as a tentative exploration of a complex subject, questions concerning businessmen and citizens have been raised. The number of children in the public schools has grown by more than 20 percent since 1950, with blacks and Puerto Ricans comprising over 50 percent of the pupils. The school budget has increased by about 150 percent since 1960-61. The race/poverty nexus appears to correlate highest with low reading levels, and evidence suggests that the quality of the principal and staff has a profound influence on  improvement in reading levels. Intermediate and high schools inherit problems of the elementary schools as well as additional serious problems. Finally, business has a vital role to play in education, not only in fostering the introduction of higher efficiency and cost/benefit thinking into the system, but also in direct assistance to vocational education, work-study, and other business-oriented programs in the schools.

Information was obtained from interviews with both the husband and wife of 203 families. In addition, an analysis of each subject's perception of his family's orientation is included. The Family Decision Making Scale, developed by Blood and Wolfe in &quot;Husbands and Wives,&quot; is used to quantify results. The mean score for husbands is 6.8; and 6.7 for wives. Thus, the mean score for both husbands and wives is in a patriarchial direction. Only two percent of the husbands saw the power structure of the family as wife dominant, while 25 percent saw it as equalitarian, with the overwhelming majority, 73 percent, seeing it as  husband dominant. Nearly the same is true for the wives, with the percentages being 4, 34, and 62 respectively. In conclusion, the findings show that not all black families are matriarchal as the popular sterotype holds and as some sociological studies seem to indicate, the black working-class families studied in this report being somewhat more patriarchal.

The game is created to give professional school personnel and prospective teachers opportunities to come to grips with typical problems of desegregated elementary and secondary schools. It is designed to pinpoint the most real and urgent problems, to generate intense personal involvement in heuristic problem-solving activities, and to promote meaningful human interaction in multi-cultural groups. In the game itself, majority-white elementary and secondary schools have been simulated in which players assume the roles of new teachers. The players practice solving typical problems  in desegregated schools, which are presented on film, in written incidents, and through role-plays. The manual itself contains a description of the components of the game, instructions for conducting the game, discussion of administrative activities, and problem materials. (Author/JW)",

Dorsett Educational Systems operated six rapid learning centers, providing instruction for students identified as potential dropouts. The students participated in two class periods each day at the center, which were individualized with a multimedia approach using audio-visual machines, programmed materials, and behavioral management techniques. It was held impossible to evaluate whether the participating students improved in verbal and mathematical skills, according to standardized tests, because  the teaching of test items, or whether closely related test items in the program invalidated test results as measure of achievement. Other side benefits of the program did not seem great. Also, the success of the performance project idea was limited, given the design of this program.

Findings relating to the public school desegregation process in Texas, attitudes of white and Negro Texas toward racial desegregation, racial voting and attitudes in the urban North, and attitudes toward parental control of public schools are considered as supporting the hypothesis. The findings led to the tentative formulation of two middle-range theories. The first, on the operation of attitude climates in the desegregation process, was explicitly sought; and the second, on the attitude  effects of dramatic events, was held to be an unexpected dividend of the project's research approach. New research methods utilized in the study included: a method of simulating attitude climates for areas smaller than the original sampling frames of the surveys used; establishment of a 200-survey library of race survey data; adaptation of a number of aggregate analysis techniques to study racial voting across urban precincts; and, two new uses of established methods for contextual models of school desegregation. Policy implications for public education encompass racial desegregation in the South, basis of white resistance in the North, and parental control of public schools. (RJ)",

Among white students, the most significant correlates of anti-black discriminatory attitudes are prejudice, parental social pressures, acceptance of political separatism, equal-status competition, and fear of future competition. Correlates of black students' tendencies to discriminate against whites are parental pressures, perceived institutional discrimination, assaultiveness, authoritarianism, and equal-status contact. There are indications that as the white student progresses  through school the importance of peer pressures as predictors of discriminatory attitudes are enhanced while the role of fear of future competition declines.

The papers served as the basis of discussions during a day-long conference in February, 1970, at the Office of Education. Topics included models of school effectiveness, teacher quality, teacher attitudes, and policy implications. While the state of research on the effects of teachers on pupil achievement is considered still primitive, a few tentative indicators are held to be emerging. From the papers in this collection, one is led to believe that schools can and do make a difference in the development of youth. Beyond this, it is thought that teachers are the single most important element in the school. The public policy implication is that more available resources must be  devoted to the development of methods for recruiting, preparing, and utilizing quality educational personnel. It is held that the fact that great numbers of children are not learning to read and are not receiving other basic tools essential for productive living demands that ways to make teachers, administrators, and all educational personnel more effective be found.

Two State Advisory Committee meetings were also held. California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc., was contracted to study service by Mexican Americans on grand juries. In addition, law enforcement agencies in five states were sent questionnaires. The Commission reports that there is widespread evidence that equal protection of  the law in the process of administration of justice is being witheld; Mexican Americans are reportedly subject to unduly harsh treatment by law enforcement officers, often arrested on insufficient grounds, and receive physical and verbal abuse and penalties which are considered disproportionately severe. The Commission also finds Mexican Americans are deprived of proper use of bail and of adequate representation by counsel. On grand and petit juries, they are substantially underrepresented and excluded from full participation in law enforcement agencies. The language problem is also held to contribute to difficulties in the equitable administration of justice to Mexican Americans. (JW)",

Findings included: (1) Race was not a significant variable, (2) Pretests and posttests of attitudes toward school shops were not significantly different at the .05 level, (3) Dropout-prone students will attend summer school if paid and enrolled in a special program, (4) Teaching methods should  actively involve such students, and (5) Negative teacher responses cause decrements in desirable student behavior.

        "description":"Because of lack of knowledge of specific occupations in defense production, assessment of the impact of defense cutbacks on the economy has been difficult. This project was undertaken to determine which skills of industrial workers in missile production are transferable to nondefense industries and to anticipate manpower problems involved in mass layoffs of these workers, in order to help formulate retraining and other programs designed to help workers adjust to cutbacks. Based on a survey of employers in related nondefense occupations, 35 defense jobs were grouped according to transferability. The study found a high degree of skill transferability, with the limiting factors being manpower needs, wage differentials, hiring practices, union regulations, and federal licensing  requirements. Recommendations were made for continued research, increased training opportunities, standardized job classifications, and utilization of defense plant administrative personnel to determine skill similarities.

This project, designed to meet the specialized needs of &quot;average&quot; high school students in terms of higher education and to determine whether a pretechnology high school program is possible was financed by a grant from the Rosenberg Foundation of San Francisco. This pretechnical training program involved the following departments of the school functioning as a team: English, science, mathematics, drafting, and the shop areas. Contents of this report cover: (1) program administration, (2) counseling role, (3) teaching methods,  (4) class analysis of the program, (5) curriculum materials, and (6) various pretechnical course outlines. It was concluded that it is possible for a community college to accept the responsibility of developing a high school preparatory program leading to semiprofessional offerings and still maintain the state and local educational requirements as demanded by state and city agencies. The cost to the district for the program, once the teachers are trained, is not significantly greater. (GR)",

Group I (six student teachers) made presentations to only high school seniors while Group II (five student teachers) made their first and last presentations to high school students and their second and third to college students. All presentations were video-taped, rated by members of the micro-class using a pretested evaluation instrument, and then reviewed and used to make changes in subsequent presentations. Statistical analysis did not indicate that micro-classes composed of high school students were more effective than micro-classes composed of  college students in terms of improving the quality of the student teachers' presentations. However, subjective reactions provided by the student teachers indicated a preference for working with high school students. They believed that while high school students represented a more realistic teaching situation, the evaluation of techniques should be made by their peers or professionally trained educators. The evaluation instrument is appended. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"To survey and analyze nursing resources and nursing education in Florida in order to make recommendations for future educational planning, data were gathered from the literature, state agencies, and a stratified random sampling by questionnaire of 1,921 licensed nurses within the State. The findings indicated that unmet needs for nursing services were due to both shortages in total numbers of nurses and in numbers of nurses employed as nurses. Most of the nurses were female, and racial balance was present among Licensed Practical Nurses but was missing among Registered Nurses. A decline was noted in hospital-based diploma nurses programs with an increase in the number of community college associate degree programs. It was concluded that Florida's nursing shortage must not be  considered a shortage of nurses but a shortage of available nursing services and that vocational and higher education institutions should carry the major responsibility for nursing education. Specific recommendations for both nursing practice and education were made and further research needs noted. The Ed.D. dissertation was submitted to the University of Florida. (SB)",

Current training programs come closer to meeting immediate needs in some health occupational areas than in others. Of the occupational categories reviewed, only dental assistants and hospital attendants can receive training at the secondary level, while the remaining receive training at the post secondary  level. Though a number of curriculums are available, a major shortcoming is the general lack of a core or cluster curriculum. Curriculums for new and emerging occupations should be developed and evaluated through an educational planning system consisting of occupational analysis, program planning, program development and testing, and documentation and dissemination of the results. In addition, to provide and train necessary workers, improved counseling and recruitment programs and techniques will be required. (SB)",

Out of a random selection of 2,654 cases, 623 finally were used in the experimental group and 601 in the control group. The client population was drawn from the releases and probationers under the supervision of seven offices of the U.S. Probation Service, and from inmates initially confined at three of the institutions operated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. This report indicates that offender populations are ample resources for potential vocational  rehabilitation clients and that a substantial percentage can be rehabilitated. It also reflects the difficulties encountered in this attempt to assess the impact of intensive rehabilitation services in addition to those already offered by federal corrections. (Author/BH)",

In 1968 there were an estimated 5,367,000 medically indigent women of childbearing age in need of subsidized family planning services, but only 773,000 (less than 15  percent) were reported as patients in public and private health agencies offering planning services. Services were identified in 1,200 of the 3,072 counties with 200 counties serving 1,000 or more patients and the remaining 1,000 counties serving less than 500 patients. Approximately 41 percent of the patients received services from the public health department, 27 percent from public and voluntary hospitals, 27 percent from Planned Parenthood Affiliates, and 5 percent from other agencies.

Another sign of activity in this area is the recent growth of postsecondary institutions of occupational education, evidenced by the fact that 60 percent of these institutions have been established since 1960. States have also  been encouraged to assist in evaluating occupational programs for the purpose of assessing quality and determining whether the needs of students and the community are being met.

Paid and volunteer workers were almost equally represented, with females in the majority (56 percent). The majority of projects (59 percent) employed more nonprofessionals than professionals, and the institutional care settings, rather than community settings, had higher ratios of nonprofessionals. Nonprofessional tasks included those formerly carried by professionals, those not performed previously by anyone, and, significantly, those previously thought of as requiring professional competence but redefined in accordance with the capacities of nonprofessional personnel.  Implications for planning and practices include recruitment and education of nonprofessionals for a wide spectrum of mental health service functions and greater recruitment of special groups, such as youth, senior citizens, underprivileged, and all ethnic minority groups. A key implication for professional education is that greater clinical diagnostic and treatment skill is needed since the professional is being relieved of time-consuming tasks not requiring professional expertise.

Course effectiveness was measured by three attitude scales, a motivation-for-enrollment questionnaire, and tests of knowledge and comprehension, which were administered at the beginning and end of the course. In addition, each student was interviewed, descriptive rating scales measuring employability were administered, and data were collected from teachers. Data were analyzed to compile an index of student success and to correlate test scores with relevant variables.  Variables most often associated with the index were self-concept, academic ability, and attitude toward working with others. Significant positive changes between pretests and posttests were noted in the crucial areas of knowledge, motivation, and personal characteristics contributing heavily to employability. There were gain scores in seven of the 16 classes on the Attitude Toward Work scale.

Survey data were gathered by observation of 180 sessions involving approximately 540 patients and was limited to the nature and extent of the touch rather than its effect on the patient. The findings indicated that a majority of the patients were touched in some way and that many circumstances, such as age, sex, race, and socioeconomic background influenced its use. Registered nurses touched almost twice as often as other personnel, and the areas most frequently touched were the patient's hand, forehead, and shoulder.  Patients on the pediatric, labor and delivery, and intensive care wards received the most touch, and those listed in good and fair conditions were touched 70 percent more often than those acutely ill. From the findings and based on concepts of touch, a theoretical construct was developed which states that touch is an integral part of nursing intervention and is to be used judiciously as a means and basis of communication.

Also, conferences sponsored by SCOPE for 15 curriculum development laboratory directors resulted in the organization of the Vocational Instructional Materials group for the purposes of promoting interest in instructional materials. A third area of concern has been experimental studies of homogeneous versus heterogeneous ability grouping in secondary schools. In examining 18 such studies, SCOPE found that little  support existed for either. SCOPE also attempted to design a curriculum development model that included task analysis, behavioral objectives, insructional activities, and evaluative procedures.

Institute activities involved formal presentations by A. W. Tenney, C. T. Appell, C. A. Stebbins, G. Swan, R. Anderson, M. Blair, W. J. Brown, Jr., B. I. Blackstone, T. Gambino, M. Hirshfeld, R. J. Holman, A. L. Reynolds, T. R. Jones, and M. Reel, which sought to provide background information related to nine task force groups. Task force members developed recommendations, guidelines, and models, identified commonalities, determined leadership activities, defined areas of research, and explored the guidance, evaluation,  and cost benefit aspects of vocational education youth organizations. Some institute recommendations were: (1) The material developed in the institute should be written into a manual on guidelines for youth organizations, (2) A research program should be set up as a cooperative effort between the existing youth organizations to determine new directions and to objectives for youth organizations, and (3) There needs to be a followup institute to treat some of the areas in greater depth.

Steps in job restructuring are: (1) determine the relationship of the job to the system of which it is a part, (2)describe the job tasks, (3) estimate the average time required for the tasks, (4) rate each task in regard to difficulty, (5) rate each task in terms of general education development, and (6) group tasks according to worker functions and general education development. After determining the tasks, it is necessary to structure the training program by determining the knowledges  and skills to be learned, abilities to be developed, and decisions to be made.

Endorsed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) this 5-year study modified a number of the emerging concepts appropriate to vocational education and integrated them with proven techniques used in vocational curriculum development. The first phase of the study involved the construction of a questionnaire and the development of a system for gathering, storing, and analyzing necessary data. The second phase, or testing phase, made use of a bi-variate inversion method to determine the effectiveness of the curriculum using as criteria student performance goals, levels of instruction, and  continuous feedback from students. Phase Three then resulted in the development of the common core curriculum through the efforts of 100 aviation mechanic instructors. Also resulting from this study was the revision of the Federal Air Regulations, Part 147, thus providing more specific guidelines for the certification and operation of these schools. It was recommended that the FAA establish a system to periodically survey this industry for the purpose of updating this curriculum. (JS)",

Each of the classification's six main classes (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional) includes five to sixteen subclasses. Within each subclass, occupations are arranged according to the number of years of general educational development required to perform them. The arrangement of main classes and subclasses is defined empirically and is consistent with the classification's theoretical base. The arrangement of classes also makes it possible to  estimate the psychological relatedness among occupations. The construction of the classification, an evaluation of its usefulness, and some illustrations of its potential practical value are outlined. (Author/SB)",

The purpose of this long-term project is to help educationally disadvantaged Negro children develop the concepts and abilities necessary for academic success. The Piagetian theory of cognitive development is discussed with reference to the main premise underlying the Cognitively Oriented Curriculum; i.e., there cannot be a basic understanding of self and world without the ability to place the self in time and space and to classify and order subjects and events. Teaching techniques and teacher attitudes are discussed, with emphasis placed on an orientation in which the teacher identifies Piagetian learning goals, observes the children to determine  operant levels, and plans sequences of activities which best implement these goals. Other specific topics covered are: classroom routine and equipment and their importance to the curriculum, language learning, sociodramatic play, and planning the curriculum. Home visits are described in terms of teacher and parent response, and implementation of the program. An extensive classroom activity guide and sample daily schedules and commentary are included.

The program consisted of a daily cognitively oriented preschool program and home visits each week to involve mothers in the educative process. The project was initiated in September 1962 and the phase covered in this report was terminated in June 1967. The 58 experimental and 65 control black children participating were economically and educationally disadvantaged. Instruments used to evaluate the project included a variety of intelligence and performance measures, several parental attitude instruments and teacher rating scales. Data were collected on  home background, birth complications, cognitive, achievement and socio-emotional variables. Children who participated in the program obtained significantly higher scores than control group children on measures of cognitive ability and achievement and received better teacher ratings on academic, emotional and social development. The significant difference in cognitive ability disappeared by third grade but other gains were maintained. Recommendations and implications for compensatory education are given and sample data collection instruments are included in the appendixes. (NH)",

Civilian instructors provided the instruction. The men were placed in levels according to their score in the USAFI pretest. Levels of instruction were comprised of instructional sequences called cycles within which were  a variety of activities: perceptual accuracy and visual efficiency training; an experience building segment; skill building activities; and a new skills application and enrichment segment. Approximately 84% of the sample attained 5th grade reading levels on the achievement test given after three weeks; grade completed prior to induction, and entry reading score were significantly correlated with regressed gain; and raw score mean achievement (USAFI Reading Subtest) increased from 14.63 to 25.49 after three weeks of instruction.

L-100 is a multimedia, multimodal, multilevel communication skills system designed for use with undereducated adults, out-of-school youth, and potential dropouts. There were 49 in the experimental group and 47 in the control group; both groups met for nine hours per week. All students were given the Metropolitan Achievement Test, Reading Intermediate level, after 10 hours of instruction, and after 100 and 200 hours. To the extent that the sample is representative of the population from which it was drawn and that the teacher questionnaires, interviews, and testing instruments were valid for this population, it appears that  significant differences in achievement favoring the L-100 group were attained. The L-100 system can be successfully managed by teachers who have had little previous experience with educational technology; for students, high interest and motivation are maintained and positive changes in attitude toward learning are exhibited as a result of the interest level of the reading selections and the instrumentation inherent in the system.

Each participant was charged a $20 fee. Most major felt needs pertained to finance or to capital projects. Six of the 11 meetings were well attended and highly successful. Four sessions covered such topics as communication, motivation, finance and budgeting, economic development and change, social problems, administrative organization, leadership, and personnel administration. Economic development aims included creating enough employment opportunities to permit enterprising, trained youth to return to their home town  if desired. Participants generally found the sessions quite informative; were at least partly satisfied with existing scheduling; found the series helpful in improving personal effectiveness; and would like to participate fully in a similar 1970-71 program. On the basis of these and other responses, a continuing education program for small cities and rural counties is strongly recommended. (LY)",

Parallel forms of the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test and the Stanford Achievement Test, Intermediate II Battery, were administered prior to and following completion of the program. Group gains in terms of grade level were relatively small. The program was limited by use of primary teachers without special training for  dealing with disadvantaged adults.

The farmers tended to be an older group with a median education of eight years, beef cattle, field crops, and dairy produce their main products; the majority of the farms were small-scale enterprises; and half the respondents were employed in off-farm jobs on a part-time basis. They reported few personal contacts with the District Agriculturist; but they used impersonal contacts to a greater extent and the types of contacts reached different people. A higher  socioeconomic status of the farm family as well as higher status as a farmer were associated with more extension contacts. It was concluded that the wide variations in the extent of contact was not explained solely by socioeconomic differences. An extension agent may influence the nature and extent of contacts by the emphasis he places on particular methods. (EB)",

Identification of specific aspects of Western AMIDS to be evaluated was facilitated by the use of Suchman's five categories of criteria for program evaluation--effort, performance, adequacy of performance, efficiency, and process. The functional flow of work was divided into three stages: Stage one--identification of goals, intents and assumptions by reviewing literature and legislation, and interviewing program staff  and the program administrators; State two--relating the results of the first stage to Suchman's five evaluative criteria; Stage three--comparing observed inputs, transactions, and outputs for each criteria with two outside standards.

A poor response showed that West European States have not yet realized this as a major problem. In contrast, intense efforts are being made in the Soviet Bloc; there further education is referred to as &quot;higher qualification&quot; and implies the improvement of practical work and labor, serving exclusively the technical efficiency of production. In France, a system of part-time schooling for high level technical competence is being developed and is being integrated intro regular higher education. In the  Federal Republic of Germany, with one exception, universities and equivalent institutions are not obliged by law to take part in further and continued education but experts aspire to an institutionalization of adult education with the universities. Industry and commerce have a real interest in it, as do professional organizations. Wherever inadequate further education could lead to a risk for members of society, universities will have to expect the creation of commissions to study and make recommendations to universities and government authorities.

The broad aim of the courses was to enable tribesmen to gain a better understanding of the causes of erosion due to lack of conservation farming. Six Headman areas received no training and no extension followup; three received training only; and three received training and followup. Followup extension work emphasized the introduction of new crops (cotton and sorghum) and improving the basic practices in existing crops. Although there are acknowledged weaknesses in the methods of sample selection and data collection, results suggest that the training  courses played an important part in initiating increased mechanical conservation (contouring), improved agricultural practices (use of fertilizers), and problem-solving, reflected in group or community projects. The trend was much more definite in the three areas which received extension followup. (PT)",

The first discusses the stages of development in acquiring reading skills--introduction, application, and mastery; and suggests two steps which should be taken with reference to reading instruction for illiterate adults--sub groups within the target population (Indians, Negroes, etc.) must be described and defined, and a set of adult criterion education tasks must be identified. The second discusses studies which have been made of several literacy programs; attached is a bibliography and a detailed listing of objectives at five reading levels in teaching vocabulary, comprehension, and study skills. The third paper discusses determining reading levels of adult students and the problems of testing.  Another describes an adult education approach to reading instruction, including a controlled environment, meeting basic needs, prevention of any failure, and an approach which is relevant to adult experience. The final paper covers the selection and use of adult reading materials. (EB)",

Sixty-nine directors handled 447 ABE classes; however, about 40% were handled by three of them. Public school classrooms were the most frequently used facilities (68%). Night classes accounted for 85%. Most of the directors' time was devoted to program and curriculum planning, supervision of teachers, and recruitment. Areas of specialization of the teachers were: elementary education (60%), secondary (34%), and special (12%), adult (7%), and other (13%). Other aspects researched were: teachers' qualification, backgrounds and perceptions; students' recruitment; and follow-up procedures, curriculum, and records. Students were interviewed to obtain data on their backgrounds,  attitudes, educational patterns, and needs. The following recommendations were made: three areas of improvements are vital--employment of more full-time adult educators, improvement of programs designed to meet the many and varied needs of adult learners, and additional state financial support.

The first objective was to replicate the literacy teaching developed for the Chiduku literacy project (see AC 008 361), which included teaching the Shona primer and then teaching how to keep farm or household records. The second objective was to evaluate more precisely the relationship between literacy and subsequent development. The follow-on program has so far concentrated on literacy continuation classes together with women's club meetings and an agricultural project to improve maize yields. Two field workers were provided for 12 months by the National Council of the Credit Union Movement. It was found that an  initial literacy level of 3 is necessary if the primer is to be completed in six weeks. It is advantageous to work with local organizations. Provisions of appropriate follow-on programs for adults who have an incomplete primary schooling might considerably reduce functional illiteracy in the Tribal Trust Lands. (EB)",

Emphasis was on good habits, attitudes, basic work skills, and production of useful conservation work. The program was a joint effort of several agencies. It was placed under the jurisdiction of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in 1965 under a Job Corps classification. Still later, it was transferred to the Department of Labor. The Nixon Administration phased out Oak Glen after assessing all Job Corps programs by the following criteria: average cost per  enrollee man year, average length of stay per enrollee, dropout rate, average reading and mathematical ability gain of the enrollee, and percentage of placement in jobs, school, or military service of enrollees leaving the center. The report includes: program outline; statistical data on number enrolled, enrollees' background, work distribution, graduates, nongraduates, and job placement; key elements which brought some success; and an organizational chart.

Problems of evaluation design--control groups, the criterion of replicability (applicability on a wider scale), statistical analysis, and implications of differing socioeconomic criteria--are considered in detail. The authors then propose a deliberately experimental approach which would permit program planners and administrators to learn faster by testing alternative concepts simultaneously. Using an analogy with the court system, they also discuss the potential  value of a \"rules in evidence\" approach to setting standards for acceptance of evaluation results.

Personal interviews were conducted in 23 large (more than 250 employees) organizations, and information was obtained from a larger sampling of &quot;small employers&quot; by mail questionnaire. The results of the two sample groups were generally consistent. The small employer group reported that expansion of vocational education at the high-school level as well as at the post-high-school level was significantly important as a means of helping business-industry with training. The larger employer placed greater emphasis on expansion at the  post-high-school level and the part-time evening programs. It is apparent that manpower development must be a cooperative undertaking involving business-industry, public education, and related government agencies; however, an apparent gulf between business-industry and public education has not been bridged. Technological developments appear to occur in business-industry more rapidly than governmental agencies are able to develop needed programs. (PT)",

Visitors came from seven counties, with Albany accounting for 58%. A comparison was made with Royal Ontario Museum on the basis of group size, sex, age, educational level, occupation, and family income. Both museums showed under-representation of those under 14. At NYSM the over-50 group was also under-represented while the 15-24 group was over-represented. Professionals, students, and housewives comprised the bulk of the respondents. The majority had incomes of $7,000 and over with the $5,000-$6,999 running a poor second. Persons with minimal education made up 3% of the NYSM audience. Other areas covered were: frequency  and recency of visit, activity prior to visit, government employees, employment locale, transportation, knowledge of exhibit through promotion, and reasons for visit. Evaluation directed attention to the following: there are too few rest areas; exhibits are too technical and old-fashioned; school classes visiting during the day are too noisy; the use of tape-recorded \"labels\" and other audio devices would help the problem of comprehension; visitors would like restaurant or coffee shop facilities; the location is poor.

The distinguishing characteristics of VISTA for measurement purposes are: a large number of volunteer program activities and sponsors, hence great diversity of outcomes; imprecise goals; and a VISTA presence that reinforces program activities but also has independent consequences. Maximum feasibility of measuring VISTA impact (and maximum benefit to program effectiveness from doing so) depend upon viewing measurement as part of a process that includes: analyzing communities to identify key points for VISTA impact; planning projects designed to achieve specific attitude and  behavioral change; training volunteers to work toward these objectives; and measuring and evaluating effectiveness according to designated behavioral indicators related to the specified goals. A specific project embodying these elements is described and recommended in the report. (There is a mistake in numbering pages in document but nothing is missing.) (EB)",

This interim report covers the time from the establishment of the School until the graduation of the third class; it consists of a review of research design and methods, a summary of findings and of implications, and a detailed summary of findings of a questionnaire designed to study problems of adjustment. Students who had been highly mobile were found not to adjust to the school as expected. Age was the least significant  variable studied; and marital status seems to be a crucial variable. Those students who had had post-secondary education in the area of health (excluding nursing) adjusted well and were self confident. The middle I.Q. group adjusted better than the low or the high.

A pretest and posttest were given to determine the amount of cognitive change. Participants were likely to be female, under 40 years of age, Negro, having more than two years of experience in adult education but not possessing a college degree. They reacted favorably to the workshop and the quality of instruction. The average person gained a total of 24 points relative to cognitive knowledge. (EB)",

This report contains an edited form of the presentation and the results of the evaluation. A profile of the adult basic education population in West Tennessee was compared with a national profile; characteristics of the adult learner and how these characteristics affect his learning were discussed; reading skills were reviewed; and characteristics of the most widely used, commercially produced materials in the country were described. Data were gathered on demography, participant reactions, and the overall effectiveness of the instructor; the Kropp-Verner Attitude Scale was  administered to obtain a composite rating of the workshop. The average participant was female, Negro, 40 or older, and married; less than 30% had Master's degrees, but about one-half had had more than two years' experience in adult education. The workshop and the instructor were rated very positively, as was the overall value of the workshop. (EB)",

The Kropp-Verner Attitude Scale was used for measuring the overall effectiveness of the conference. Inferential statistics and hypotheses were deleted from the study; only arithmetic means and frequency tables employing percentages were used. The profile of a Tennessee adult basic education supervisor is that of a male, 35 or older, having a Master's degree, with two or more years teaching experience in adult basic education and two or more years as supervisor, and with more  than 10 years of experience in public school work at the secondary level. Responses to the evaluative items in the questionnaire showed that the conference was considered to be very successful; the Kropp-Verner Scale supported this. It is recommended that these conferences be continued at least annually. The same methodology should be employed (joint planning by local supervisors, State Department staff, and university personnel) to ensure that the total needs of the State are met.

He must correlatively learn the organization in meaning of and among these last named elements, that is, the internal semantic map of the language to be learned. The developmental stages he goes through and the kinds of mistakes he makes on the way toward approximating the adult matching and map must increasingly become a target study of language acquisition investigation. Study of adult language must first be undertaken in order to properly trace the course of child speech development; accordingly the first section of the present paper follows an initial  probing into the notion of matching and mapping. The second section theorizes that certain semantically-contentful aspects of the realworld have a universal representation in language in general and hence have an identical abstract encoding at the base of each language; these aspects participate in universal analytic semantic-structure; and these structures together embody a unified and integrated pattern perhaps ultimately with simple principles of organization.

A teacher has a choice, not only of accepting or rejecting materials, but adapting or rewriting them. (The fourth possibility is often viewed both as unjustifiably troublesome to the rewriter and an affront to the original author.) Of the dozens of language teachers with whom the author has spoken in the course of this study, he has found none who did not claim at least that he made some small changes or additions to his printed textbook; many make major changes. Under these circumstances, two points need to be emphasized: (1) various degrees of adaptation, augmentation, and rewriting form a  continuum, at the far end of which stands the writing of original materials; and (2) before one can begin to adapt or augment or rewrite or write, and before one can even decide which of these four to undertake, it is necessary to evaluate what is already available. The present paper offers guidelines for evaluation, and outlines a general procedure for adaptation. (Author/AMM)",

        "description":"An urgent need was felt for broader implementation of processes similar to those indicated in this study to help reorient teachers effectively, quickly, and as painlessly as possible so that they can better meet the needs of the Spanish surnamed and the Indian Americans enrolled in public schools. Six prime questions were involved during the implementation of this in-service education model in a tri-ethnic community: Will there be satisfication with traditional curriculum when cultural differences are understood? Is it possible to develop an awareness of a person's own needs which may be in conflict with the student's needs? To what extent will self-evaluation help in understanding techniques and methods used with students? Will needs for special materials, techniques, and  community involvement be apparent and understood by the school personnel? Will an in-service program be able to initiate required curriculum changes? What are the results of the total project? In summarizing, the author emphasizes that meaningful social changes in school programming activities can occur. A base-line direction for change can be established; a project such as the model described can set such a base-line program of recommendations. The author feels that personnel in schools with students from minority groups should know about the processes described here. (AMM)",

        "description":"In attempting to understand and describe the means by which human beings actually produce and interpret the message forms appropriate to a given domain of verbal behavior, it becomes apparent that the cognitive processes involved can reasonably be characterized as information processing phenomena. Throughout the production of a message form, an individual must select and encode the information that he wants to convey and take into account those additional informational items which, though not a part of the semantic content, are nevertheless necessary to its encoding. Similar considerations are necessary for the accurate interpretation (decoding) of messages received. The discussion presented here considers a particular type of natural information processing routine that appears  especially significant in the semantic phases of message production and interpretation. Because of their close association with the phenomenon of semantic marking, routines of this type are here referred to as marking rules. A preliminary description of the structure and operation of such routines is followed by a detailed illustration drawn from a recent study of personal address terminology in a southern Philippine language (Samal). This example is then used as the basis for some further suggestions concerning the formal properties of marking rules in general. (Author/FWB)",

Questions arising from this basic one are: (1) What features of a child's cultural background directly or indirectly affect his behavior in the classroom? (2) What is the affect of cultural differences (a) between the teacher and the child? (b) on the teacher's perception of the child? (c) on the child's perception of the teacher and of the learning process and himself? (3) How effective are the usual techniques of evaluation used by teachers in measuring learning capacity and skill, cross culturally? The report focuses on the education of  Afro-American children in the Berkeley (California) Public Schools, but the author hopes that the study will be useful in isolating some of the \"universals\" of cultural contact in the classroom. Individual sections (1) present an historical outline of black culture and education in the public schools; (2) discuss black culture and social interaction in the classroom; (3) discuss the performances of teachers whose classrooms were visited; (4) present transcriptions of taped instances of actual teacher-pupil interaction.

It was found that the most frequently used outlets for the projects considered were journal articles, conference papers, and technical reports, and that a little over 50% of the items produced were covered in widely available abstract journals, bibliographies and indexes. The most productive fields, in terms of the quantity of items published in  journals and presented at meetings, appeared to be psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics. A diagram showing dissemination stages over time reveals that a period of from two to four-and-one-half years intervenes between the start of a project and publication of the results in a journal or in conference proceedings, and that another year-and-a-half elapses before the items produced are covered in secondary sources.

A novel is written to be enjoyed; part of the enjoyment lies in the relaxation derived from undertaking a satisfying activity. It must be acknowledged, however, that many students have no literary bent, and seldom read a \"classic\" even in their own language except for examination purposes. Many students are not capable of successfully meeting the formidable challenge of the final examination: they have thoroughly mastered even the present-day form of the target language, let alone come to the stage of enjoying reading for its own sake. It is glibly claimed that the reading of the best examples of the  literature of the foreign language is valuable for its cultural insights; this is doubtful, for mediocre literature is more representative of a culture than its more refined counterpart. Teaching sights have to be considerably lowered, lined on a utilitarian target in the hope that the student can be equipped to read professional journals or other material that will be helpful to him in future studies or in his career. The problem is to encourage the learner to read anything at all on his own initiative in the foreign language. (Appended is a questionnaire sheet for the student's record.) (AMM)",

The distinctive dialect characteristics must be recorded before they are obliterated, and the dynamics of this transition must also be observed and studied.

The author presents, in the form of a \"duologue,\" some pertinent views from a variety of sources, and stresses the need for a more realistic approach to teacher-training. A training course is regarded here as inadequate if it does not embrace ample training and guidance in such \"bread-and-butter\" matters as class discipline, backboard presentation, conducting oral and group work, planning and correcting homework, arranging extramural activities, overseeing exercise books and various projects, making visual aids and using them, handling film-projectors, and advice on dealing with specific teaching  items. Above all, the teacher must be shown how to plan his work so that he is able to conserve his vital energy. The trainee should not be developed as a future textbook writer; his valuable training time should not be consumed by the \"barren practice of note-taking\"; his training should be based on seminars or discussion groups rather than lectures. Even the tradition of the demonstration class should be re-examined. The discipline of linguistics should not be confused with the art of language teaching. Emphasis on linguistic theory can be justified only if it conduces to successful classroom practice. (AMM)",

        "description":"The purposes of this first phase of a proposed two-phase study were (1) to collect necessary baseline data for the completion of the total two-part study, and (2) to note the effects on school achievement of one year's instruction in English given to kindergarten Navaho-speaking monolinguals. The following groups from the Window Rock-Ft. Defiance schools were selected: kindergarten Navaho-speaking monolinguals, kindergarten compound bilinguals (Navaho-English), kindergarten Navaho-speaking monolinguals who received on year's concentrated instruction in English, first-grade Navaho-speaking monolinguals, first-grade English-speaking monolinguals, and first-grade compound bilinguals. Measures of intelligence and achievement were obtained. Analysis of variance and Sheffe's technique  were used to test for differences in order to meet the second objective of this project. Aside from getting baseline data and finding expected differences (e.g., English-speaking monolinguals scored higher in achievement than Navaho-speaking monolinguals), the most promising discovery was the positive influence of instruction in English on school performance. In light of this, it is important to determine the long-term effects of early concentrated English instruction in a school setting. (Author/AMM)",

In these tests the student is presented words one by one through a loudspeaker and asked to repeat them as best he can. These responses are judged by a native speaker of American English with no special training,  who compares the student's performance with the recorded standard and then determines the next step in the program.

On this basis, he devised exclusion therapy which establishes, for resistive clients, a kind of severity of initiation. The paper describes the process as follows: a strong, admirable therapist who seems to hold out the opportunity to help the youths grow up, demands of them seven full days free of addiction prior to being admitted to therapy. Individual therapy and subsequent group therapy are both kept continuously contingent on &quot;cleanness.&quot; The paper describes the population with which exclusion therapy was developed: 282 adolescents, age 15-25, who self-described themselves as hippies, drop-outs,  drug freaks, etc. The major emphasis of the technique is elaborated, with a constant focus on the consistency of the father-figure therapist. The discussion which concludes the paper stresses that exclusion therapy is not for everyone, but that it had been effective on a large percentage of its resistive client population. (TL)",

The author and his colleagues embarked on a series of studies, using naturally occurring adoptions as their subject source, to tease apart hereditary and environmental factors thought to be implicated in schizophrenia. The bulk of the paper is an elaboration of eight adoption strategy research designs which they have developed. These designs focus variously on the adoptees, their natural families and adoptive families, in an effort t collect data which might clarify the relative contributions of heredity and environment, as well as heredity environment interaction. Where currently available, data is presented and tentative  conclusions drawn.

Research to date is viewed as assuming that \"interference\" manifests its effects over the age continuum and implies that an increased susceptibility to interference in the aged is unmodifiable. A more optimum research strategy, it is held, would concentrate on experimental manipulations which lead to the modification of age-performance functions. The bulk of the paper focuses on the research and implications which follow the adoption of this \"modification\" strategy. Three major classes of variables, of  major interest in the study of learning and memory in the aged, provide the context: (1) degree of learning; (2) mediated vs. non-mediated learning; and (3) response time. The emphasis is on the provisions of alternate, empirical methods to provide for sources of confounding which mitigate against unbaised age-comparisons of the processes of retention and memory.

The goal, as applied to mental health systems, is the establishment of a \"best\" improvement path which can be implemented with minimum uncertainty. The uncertainty can be minimized by utilizing a model, a representation, of the system which can be manipulated, torn apart, reconstructed, all without risk to the real system. The concepts involved in this \"model\" approach are viewed as the basis for solving a wide range of problems encountered in designing a community mental health system. Three examples are given: (1) the development of an expansion path for community services, which concerns  the effective distribution of resources; (2) a network analysis which focuses on how many separate cycles a client goes through at an agency, their duration and resultantly, the incumbent demand for a comprehensive information system; and (3) an agency clustering/problem clustering model which focuses on clients' problem and condition sequences, and the implications for more efficient and orderly service delivery.

The causes are seen in the social and commercial pressures of society which leave men less room to act as distinct and separate individuals. The intrusion of violence into everyday life via the media stimulates men and increasingly serve to contaminate their interpersonal relationships and sexual lives, through which they seek to escape these pressures. A solution is offered: provide straightforward information, via comprehensive sex education, to counter  the influence of media stimulation which links sex with violence.

Group meetings, directed by counselors, were held three times per week, with part of each meeting being devoted to employment related discussions and activities and part to recreation. Two successive programs were developed to increase the employability of chronic patients. During its three years of operation 250 patients have been referred to the project, and although no-statistical assessment is available many individuals have been  employed for significant lengths of time. The essential benefits of the project appear to be: (1) it relieves clinicians of much of the load of providing supportive contact and serves to prevent or minimize breakdowns in patient's functioning; (2) it provides social-recreational experiences which can be used as an adjunct or alternative to psychotherapy; and (3) it offers opportunities for psychiatric patients to assume a formal role in helping others.

        "description":"The nature of counseling in the year 2000 will be determined more by developing social needs than by existing programs. Since the direction of social development is toward increasingly dynamic, complex, and potentially stressful times, counseling services must be responsive to such conditions. The university counselor of the future will need to be more: (1) interdisciplinary; (2) vocationally flexible; (3) culturally aware; (4) willing to affect changes in the structure; (5) open about his own values; (6) venturesome and less centralized in his work location; (7) responsive to situational dynamics; and (8) innovative in his helping responses. The author sees Caplan's Community Mental Health Model as the best contemporary model for fitting these qualities into a theoretical  framework. It looks at the promotion of mental health on three levels. A counseling service built upon these principles would be a loose and flexible consortium of professionals with a team approach to situational problems, and stable centers for certain educational and therapeutic purposes.

Results showed that time-out from positive reinforcement functions as a negative reinforcer for human avoidance behavior, and also elicits aggressive behavior under certain conditions within the avoidance paradigm. Extensive research is cited both in the introduction and the general discussion. The second paper describes a similar study which sought to explore methods for the automatic measurement of aggression in humans in a  situation where independent and dependent (aggressive behavior) variables were specified. Fourteen college freshmen served as subjects to determine whether the blocking of reinforcement by a rat elicited aggressive behavior toward the rat. All responses were in the form of pushing buttons. Results showed that many subjects responded to the blocking of reinforcement by the rat by inflicting pain on it. (TL)",

The purpose of this paper is to correct this imbalance, and hopefully to generate some of the enthusiasm for gaming that all simulators seem to acquire. The design of the paper is as follows: (1) to introduce the family life educator to simulation games with a few concepts and a rationale for their utilization; (2) to deal with classroom use of the technique with several illustrations of simulation games; (3) to discuss how to design a simulation game which is illustrated by a game being  developed by the writer explicitly for use in family education; (4) to examine evaluation research on the effectiveness of educational gaming; and (5) to consider implications of the method in terms of the goals of family life education and some of the unresolved problems of the field.

Data were obtained by testing students in the experimental and control groups by administering pre and posttest instruments which focused on four major areas: (1) knowledge concerning occupations and related information; (2) level of occupational aspiration; (3) perceptions of the degree of importance of certain job factors; and (4) student attitudes toward work, self, and education. Analysis of the data revealed that no significant differences in knowledge existed between the experimental and control groups. However, the fact that the experimental group performed equally well on a textbook oriented test  suggests that the field experience compensated for the lack of study time normally devoted to study of the textbook. Career aspirations of students in both groups were higher following the treatment. (Author/KJ)",

        "description":"This paper describes an ongoing research project which is designed to test the effectiveness of crisis-oriented social systems intervention as a model for primary prevention with bereaved families. The families' immediate reactions to the death and their subsequent reorganization are discussed in light of two factors: (1) the interaction pattern that exists between the family and the larger social system; and (2) the interaction pattern that prevails within the family system itself. Observations to date have suggested that the degree to which a family will accept and benefit from outside intervention at the time of a death is a function of its incorporation of the norms and values of society into its own familial value system. In addition, the type of systems coping patterns  employed by the family, as well as the role the deceased had assumed within the family system, have been found to be critical variables that influence the course of bereavement and subsequent readjustment. Data obtained from the second paper supports the contention that the behavior of bereaved individuals does progress through various stages of grief, and that readjustment of the family depends greatly on the role of the deceased prior to his death.

An alternative is suggested which emphasizes the problem solution strategies which these children bring to the school situation. Solutions were analyzed in terms of: (1) their probability; (2) their efficiency at permitting a present problem to be solved; and (3) their usefulness as building blocks for future solutions. It is suggested that Indian children, like all children, have a range of problem solving skills, but that they do not meet these three criteria for the learning which is expected of them when they enter school. What happens to these children, confronted with such a situation, is described. The paper concludes that teachers of children whose solution strategies are  inadequate for learning as it is currently structured must focus more on \"how\" they learn and less on \"what\" they learn. A balance must be established between changing their solution strategies and changing the schools to permit success for children with currently divergent strategies. (TL)",

Three such variables were manipulated in this experiment: (1) warmth of interaction; (2) accuracy of understanding; and (3) the proposal of compromises.

Results supported the hypotheses: (1) that accuracy of understanding of the opponent's position was related to the  number of agreements reached in negotiations; (2) that warmth of interaction facilitates negotiations, but not opponent's attitude change; and (3) that proposing compromises leads more readily to agreements than not proposing them.

In this latter, the author views most psychotherapists as not adhering to a particular system of therapy, but as growing toward a unique style with definable parameters. A Therapeutic Rating Form with ten parameters is discussed and each parameter described: (1) caring; (2) ego-strengthening; (3) encountering; (4) feeling; (5)  interpersonal analyzing; (6) pattern analysis; (7) reinforcing; (8) self disclosing; (9) value reorienting; and (10) re-experiencing.

Nine variables, reflecting diverse perspectives, were selected as a basis for assessing response to treatment. Data was collected on 41 subjects. A composite measure of improvement was established via factor analysis and a stepwise multiple correlation used to determine if the predictors were related to it. They were found to be not very effective. Bowen's study analyzed the relationship of long-standing variables (e.g. birth order, family size, etc.) and more recent social functioning variables (e.g.  arrests, marital status, etc.) with post treatment functioning. The best predictors of future functioning were those variables which measured recent social functioning. Implications for client selection and treatment planning are discussed.

        "description":"The study is an application of Newcomb (1953) and Heider's (1958) formulations of balance theory to verbal interviewee behavior. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) imbalanced interview conditions are associated with a faster rate of speech; and (2) imbalanced interview conditions are associated with greater interviewee productivity. Theoretical considerations are included. Twenty-four subjects who had participated in two previous interviews with the same interviewer were selected to take part in a third interview. Half had strongly like the interviewer and half had strongly disliked him. Content of the third interview was derived from a pre-interview attitude questionnaire. Interviews were manipulated to produce imbalanced and balanced conditions. Results showed: (1) that speech  rate was significantly higher in the imbalanced conditions; and (2) that interviewees who liked their interviewer were more productive in the imbalanced than in the balanced condition. It was concluded that support was provided for balance theory by utilizing previously untapped indices of imbalanced states and their resolution, and that the mode used by a person to restore balance depends on the nature of the imbalance producing condition.

All subjects were administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the Rorschach, the Kuder Personal Preference Record, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS); in addition, selected demographic information was obtained. Several years later the sample was classified into three criterion groups: (1) rehabilitated (R); (2) nonrehabilitated due to physical considerations (NR-P); and (3) non-rehabilitated due to a \"motivational\" deficiency (NR-M). Among other findings, Group R members demonstrated relatively favorable psychological resources, both intellectual and emotional,  had a slightly higher level of formal education, and were frequently unmarried. Results for the non-rehabilitated groups are included. A discussion of the value of the various testing measures for this client population concludes the paper. (Author/TL)",

Deplorable social and economic inequities are examined. The poor, according to the author are discriminated against in terms of health factors, housing, employment, income and power. Following from this he assumes that the current system is unefficacious and must be modified or completely changed so all people can enjoy it. As a possible means of change, riots and revolution are considered: (1) what are they; (2) what are their goals; and (3) can they work in the United States. The author contends that the American cultural make-up would not, at this time, support total revolution. His answer, and the one for  which he builds a case, is a drastic modification of the free-enterprise system, with the government remodifying the system through the legislative process. To those who say that the revolution is here or coming soon, he responds \"no,\" without, however, ruling out that possibility should drastic changes not be forthcoming. (TL)",

So, what we actually have is a double barreled barrage of racism to combat. Because of controversy concerning relevant and meaningful educational opportunities for the lower socio-economic black students, white educators of black students have been signaled out for review and challenge. The changing urban society and the emerging and changing black concept are seen by some to be the biggest causes of this new controversy. The task of the elementary counselor in an urban setting is to be cognizant of all factors which play an important part upon the cultural values and self concept of his black counselees. The  counseling service should be designed to either affect all children directly or it should help to create an atmosphere and school environment in which all children find the necessary security and self confidence which will enable them to grow and mature into productive adults. Quality-plus approaches (not color) are needed to counsel black children in the urban school today. (KJ/Author)",

Formerly clients appeared to come in with a plethora of ego energy, while now it seems more like a depletion. Explicit in our culture now is the idea that it is almost healthy and good to publicize one's private experience. Some of counselors'\"tried and true\" counseling methods of the past are less than overwhelmingly successful with clients who hold these values, and who bring in such value derivation problems. Thus a fundamental change in techniques may be called for. New forces have appeared such as the problems of population explosion and a time limited planet. If counseling psychology is to continue to remain viable and relevant more segments of the profession should  become involved in problems that are usurping the minds of the lay public at the present time. One immediate change would be to have psychological service centers and counseling psychologists rescue the ear of university faculty and administrators from the confusions which surround it.

Subjects saw the stimulus persons either in positive settings, neutral settings, or negative settings. Analysis of variance of changes in trait ratings of the stimulus persons revealed significant effects due to content of the photographs, their frequency of exposure, and the content by exposure interaction. Contrary to Blume's (1966a, b) results for black models, positive exposure significantly enhances evaluations, and negative exposure decreased evaluations. White models showed primarily the positive effect. Overall, increasing exposure enhanced attitudes. This effect was very strong for positive stimuli, weak for  neutral stimuli and slightly reversed for negative stimuli. Exposure effects (Zajonc, 1968) and associative learning processes appear to operate in opposing directions for negative stimuli. (Author)",

Conference participants expressed various points of view which future researchers should consider in developing research on affective outcomes. Although it might be desirable for broad research strategies to be developed by groups of interested and concerned professionals, the actual research should be developed and conducted by the researcher in physical education. A variety of approaches, particularly in elementary school physical education, should be encouraged in hopes of improving the quality and significance of the research efforts. A review of research  studies in the area of affective outcomes (1960-1970) suggests inadequacy of measurement techniques to assess attitudes toward physical activity. It is recommended that a broadly conceived research program in this area begin with a series of observations of various programs to ascertain key variables to be considered in future studies.

        "description":"A major concern of this report was to compare the effect of three verbal reinforcement combinations (VRCs) on the rate at which children learn a simultaneous two-choice discrimination problem. The experiments were designed to test the following: (1) whether relative effectiveness of the VRCs was dependent upon task complexity or subject age; (2) what were the effects of the VRCs, task complexity, and overtraining on the learning of a discrimination reversal problem in children; (3) what were the relative effects of the delay of the VRCs; and (4) whether the VRCs would differentially affect the retention of a simultaneous discrimination problem. Findings indicate that regardless of sex or age or problem complexity, the VRCs involving the use of the term \"wrong\" led to rates of  learning superior to those produced by use of the \"right-nothing\" combination. Similar effects were produced for a discrimination reversal problem. Delay of the VRCs seriously interfered with the learning of a simultaneous discrimination problem in children. Further stimulus research is suggested. (Author/CJ)",

This extensive study seeks to explore the educational careers of military dependents from their own point of view, compare them with local pupils, and supplement those comparisons with views of teachers and principals. The approach of the study is sociocultural, and uses unstructured interviews and participant observations in addition to information in the school record. Subjects were sixth-grade military dependents. Discussed are the following: academic achievement as it pertains to sociology and education; self concept and sociometric status; the phenomenology of the &quot;stranger&quot; in the schools; and the view of the schools as seen by the pupils. As a result of this study,  several recommendations are offered for changes within the school which would help create a better academic and social environment for all pupils: changes in staff responsibility to enable the teacher to &quot;teach&quot;; changes in materials and teacher training to ensure respectful treatment of minorities and cultural sub-groups; and more adequate counseling services to alleviate the fears of the mobile pupil.

Students were selected from comparable grade levels in six countries - Denmark, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, and the United States. Data were collected through the questionnaire \"Your Ideas About People and Rules\" and interview questions. Data on children's overt behavior were collected through the \"Peer Nomination Inventory.\" Major questions to be answered for each national sample were: (1) what are the variations in the data by age, sex, and  SES; and (2) what are the relationships among the variables by age, sex, and/or SES. Two types of reliability tests performed concerned the reliability of coding categories developed for cross-national coding of interview items and the reliability of coders. In general, reliability tended to increase with age for low SES and change curvilinearly for high SES groups. (Author/CJ)",

Five parallel experiments were conducted, each for a different learning objective or task (identification, comparison, classification, generalization, application), and replicated with seven social studies and science content areas. Seven stimulus sequences were designed for each content area conforming to seven visual-verbal modes of presentation. Subjects were 617 fifth and sixth grade students. Performance was tested immediately after exposure to the experimental treatment and about two weeks later by specially constructed verbal objective tests. The results and conclusions include: (1)  the Motion Picture Sound and Still Picture Sound treatments were generally superior to all other treatment modes for the Identification, Comparison, Classification, and Generalization learning objectives; and (2) there was little evidence that a hierarchical pattern existed between higher order and lower order tasks for the learning of cognitive information.

Subjects were counselor trainees at North Texas State University during the period from 1968 to 1970. Instruments used were the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale, the Philosophies of Human Nature Scale, the Test of Counselor Attitudes, and Personal Orientation Inventory and the Counselor Rating Blank. Post-test results indicated that trainees made significant positive gains toward self actualization, and  that those who participated in intensive group counseling, particularly as group leaders, evidenced greater positive change than those who did not serve as leaders.

DS correlated only with the second; (2) Ss were required to interchange mentally the letters in the corners of a square. This task did not correlate with DS; (3) free recall of series of 10 two-digit numbers did not correlate with DS; (4) Ss were presented multiple series of two-digit numbers, from five pairs up to 10 pairs. DS correlated highest using sets of six and seven number pairs; (5) the relationship between DS and memory for visual patterns was examined; with no correlation; (6) the relationship  between DS and verbal memory was investigated using the immediate recall, recall after one presentation of a series, vocabulary, and DS. The first three tests correlated significantly with each other while DS did not correlate significantly with any of the three.

The preliminary questionnaire requested total enrollment, as well as first time enrollment by sex and by full- or part-time attendance. The supplementary questionnaire called for a variety of detailed breakdowns. Summary tables show national totals for survey items by institutional control, level of institution, and State for fall 1969, as well as trend data from 1963. Because many institutions were unable to provide final enrollment counts by the date requested and because some were obliged to make partial estimates, no data on individual institutions are included in this report. All totals and subtotals presented are subject to change when the results of the  supplementary enrollment survey are published. (Author)",

The study's basic hypothesis is that young people of 16 to 20 years of age form a meaningful age group that traditional institutions might no longer serve as effectively as other structures deliberately designed for today's youth and their needs. Recommendations are made for: (1) founding four-year institutions encompassing grades 11 through 14, organized to meet the special educational needs of late adolescents; (2) striving for an integrated community, with a minimal number of explicit specialities and roles; (3) initiating temporary working internships; and (4) designing flexible  schedules in units of 10 or 12 weeks available the year around.

A questionnaire was sent to 1,988 schools whose names included the words \"middle school,\" as well as to other schools that could conceivably be considered middle schools. Stratified random samples of 275 elementary and 91 junior high schools were added to furnish a basis for comparing middle schools with non-middle schools. Tables show (1) number, location by USOE regions, grades included, enrollment, and grades taught by various types of schools; (2) ratios of pupils to counselors, teachers, and administrators by grade and enrollment; (3) types of class schedules and study provisions, kinds of athletic programs and social activities, and primary responsibility  for discipline by grade organization. The middle school philosophy is to prepare pupils for adult responsibilities withou exposing them prematurely to experiences for which they are unprepared. Although less than half the respondents believe that their schools are maximally implementing this philosophy, a larger proportion believe that their schools are attempting to do so.

The author delineates the role of education in the development of manpower needs in our highly technical society, and suggests specific supportive action that should be taken. Elementary, secondary, and postsecondary institutions are identified as the agencies best equipped to produce comprehensive manpower programs. A conclusion is reached that there exists a need for a policy concerned with providing needed manpower to the labor market, educating and training those unemployable, and continuing the education and retraining of present workers. Priority  should be given to the preparation of youth and adults for transition to work roles in a new and changing technological age. Historical approaches to and current trends in manpower development are also presented. (Author/JF)",

This colloquium was specifically designed to help the planning committee members make recommendations to the council. Among the major ideas coming from these meetings were the following: Two resulted in favorable action--new AERA publications, and improving relations with the Federal Government; two are pending additional information--improving the research climate in schools of education, and initiating research in educational development; and one appears to have been permanently tabled-association  reorganization. Committee members indicated that the colloquium satisfactorily accomplished its objective of providing ideas to the committee. (RA)",

The power to effect change is lodged with administrators and board members, but teachers, who are charged with the ultimate responsibility of implementing innovations, often resist changes. To modify opinions about decision-making responsibilities in the schools, teams of change agents, each team consisting of an administrator and several teachers from a school, consulted with staff members from the University of Pittsburgh Learning Research and Development Center. Questionnaires administered to these teams show equivocal results, with some opinion shifts in the desired direction and some in the opposite  direction, and few differences between experimental and control groups.

The typical planitiff is a high school or junior high school student who has been suspended, expelled, transferred, or otherwise disciplined. Although most of the cases focus on the legal right of school officials to act as they did, others emphasize the fairness of the procedures by which the disciplinary action was handled; both issues often appear  in the same case.

Significant gains were made in creating a favorable climate for (1) change in instructional technology, and (2) in staff attitudes toward the development of a learner-responsive instructional system at the project school.

For example, a psychologist can make quantified measurements of behavior for programing functional requirements; utilize experimental techniques in evaluating particular design variables; and construct surveys, case studies, and similar measurements for the validation of planning criteria.

        "description":"This document analyzes different approaches to the goal of equal educational opportunity and discusses the judicial role in achieving it. One approach argues that equal dollars or equal facilities and services must be provided to each pupil. Some people have contended that racially segregated schools deprive minority students of an equal educational opportunity. Others, supporting an outcomes approach, have taken the perspective that equal educational opportunity must be defined in terms of the effectiveness of the resources used and the processes of the educational system; i.e., each child should be developed to the minimum level sufficient for adequate functioning in a modern world. The document urges that as a matter of policy, an outcomes definition of equal educational  opportunity is more sensible, but that it is impractical and inappropriate for judicial consideration and enforcement. For a constitutional decision on equal education to be effective, it must be simple, amenable to the application of court power, and acceptable to the public. (JF)",

Constrained maximization equations take account of (1) real expenditure per pupil; (2) real school taxes, income taxes, and nonschool property taxes per household; and (3) homeowner's proportion of property tax. The model shows that matching grants stimulate more local expenditure than the customary lump sums. Regardless, the impact on spending per pupil is proportional to the number of pupils per household--not to aid per pupil. To predict results of matching grants, States can judge by the response of spending per pupil to changes in costs over time. An incomplete version of the model accounted for some 80 percent of the variance in school  expenditure among States during 1954-1956, and, unlike earlier models, gave results consistent from year to year.

Through examination of such sources as the International Project Information Service, the International Research Referral Service, the Eleventh World Conference, and the Multilingual Rehabilitation Terminology References, the Project attempted to evaluate the international need for improved rehabilitation services in both economically developed and developing areas. It was recognized that  multidisciplinary cooperation in the international rehabilitation field is too complex to formulate static conclusions; therefore, the results of the study indicated a variety of procedures and broad areas for further study. Appendixes present additional data including reports on rehabilitation services in the Philippines and Nigeria, and information on selected conference participants. (RD)",

The Basic Indexing and Retrieval System (BIRS), an automated information system operated by the regional IMC at Michigan State University, is described.

The sample consisted of 300 newly admitted patients in a state mental hospital, male and female, aged 16 years and over. Data on patients' characteristics are presented in 21 tables. Data on leisure activities and organizational participation are presented in 17 additional tables, with breakdowns for sex and age (under or over 30 years).

Results showed that certain persons with severe sensorineural hearing loss have low frequency discimination for the frequency location of speech formants which is nearly normal, and that structured training is necessary if the formant frequency is above 250 Hz. The synthetically enhanced consonants appeared to be easier to discriminate than naturally spoken consonants. Due to electronic problems, no conclusions were reached concerning the wearable transposer aids.

        "description":"A major problem in the use of films in instruction is to get the right film to the right teacher when he wants it and needs it, and to do all this at a minimum cost. This paper presents a view of film distribution systems in terms of two interrelated subsystems: a logistic subsystem and a behavioral subsystem. The logistic subsystem consists of those factors which affect the number of bookings that a library completes. The behavioral subsystem consists of those factors which affect the demand for films. The paper proposes that a program budget approach be used to minimize costs. A program budget would break down allocations according to the independent factors affecting a system's operation. (JY)",

The seven selected methods of presenting stimuli to the learners were: motion pictures with spoken verbal; motion pictures, silent; still pictures with spoken verbal; still pictures, silent; printed verbal and spoken verbal; printed verbal; and spoken verbal. Six hundred and seventeen fifth and sixth grade boys and girls were divided into three mental ability groups and then were randomly assigned to one of the seven presentation modes. The results of the experiment indicated that there was no presentation mode superiority across the three learning objectives; however, the print and spoken verbal modes produced  significantly superior performance test scores among modes in the classification objective. This implied that when specific types of learning can be identified, particular presentation modes will produce superior learning effectiveness. The study also points out the need for learning objectives to make a media stimuli taxonomy useful to the design of instructional materials. (MF)",

        "description":"The practicality of using speeded speech as an educational medium was explored in an Immersion study, in a Criterion study, and in Retention studies. Tapes of novels were used for listening; compression was achieved by a device that removed small segments of the tape-recorded speech sounds and, then, abutted the remainder of the speech record together. In the Immersion study, seven male college students listened to high spped speech (425 wpm-475 wpm) for five days, 11 hours a day. The results of this experiment confirmed previous findings that comprehension of time-compressed speech can be improved by simple practice routines to relatively high levels at speeds of about 2-1/2 times normal speed. In the Criterion study, seven of 10 male college students reached criterion, or 90  percent of normal speed score at least once on a listening test presented at 375 wpm. However, they did not reach criterion consistently. The Retention studies were designed to determine to what extent the skill of listening to compressed speech is retained, and to what extent material learned via compressed speech is retained. The results indicated that content is retained, but that this may or may not be true of skill. Further research is anticipated. (MF)",

In the Listening Aid Study II, an experiment was designed to retest the advantages of the precis as a listening aid when the precis expressed the overall meaning of a passage. Also, a new listening aid was introduced which provided a short, pure tone to indicate crucial sentences. The hypothesis that listening aids would improve performance was not borne out. In the Self-Pacing Study, it was discovered that listeners tended to choose a rate of speed very close to the speed at which they first heard compressed speech (1.5x normal recording speed), and that there were no clearcut differences between self- and externally-paced conditions. In another  study, 11 passages were selected from an introductory textbook on psychology and recorded. They were then the basis for the development of standardized multiple-choice tests. A fourth study, done on the use of compressed speech as a review technique, indicated that reading was a superior technique for review. However, four of the eleven subjects in the experiment said that they preferred compressed speech for review. Two findings of previous research were reaffirmed; compressed speech is acceptable and practice is desirable. (MF)",

        "description":"In compressed speech listening tests, performance was not significantly affected by listening aids presented during training. The aids consisted of a summary of the material to be heard and a list of key words in the material to be heard; the summary was presented to one group and the list of key words to another group. A third group did not receive a listening aid. All groups improved with practice in their ability to listen to compressed speech at 375 wpm, achieving a final mean score which averaged better than 90% of normal speed score. An examination of the data indicates that good listeners tend to be generally able and well informed, but that at higher speeds general language ability is increasingly important. The evidence also suggests that good performance at higher speed  is associated with listening for meaning rather than concentration on specific words and details. The failure of the listening aids to improve performance may be attributable to their focusing attention on aspects of the passage which were irrelevant to the test questions. Subsequent research is planned. (MF)",

PLATO III, the model now being used in a maternity nursing course, has 70 student terminals (20 of which can be used at any one time) connected to a CDC 1604 computer. Approximately, 120 students have had lessons in maternity nursing via PLATO; 100 of these received the complete series of 22 lessons. The total time students required for completion of the series ranged from 28 to 40 hours. This compared with 84 hours spent in a classroom by control students. Student reaction to the computer varied considerably from one period of time to the next and from individual to individual.  However, one-half of the students did rate PLATO as the preferred medium for learning (as compared with lecture, textbook, film, and television); whereas, only one student in 25 rated PLATO as the worst medium. The course was found to be suitable for student learning in an associate degree nursing program. When the course and PLATO equipment were transferred to the regular classroom the seven classroom instructors found them easy to use. It is desirable that teachers using computerized instruction change their role concept. (MF)",

Some of the more obvious reasons for the failures in educational technology are these: there is research but not development, equipment but no materials, a market but no customer, money but not enough, programs but no systems, and there is the belief of educators that teachers should have autonomy. Questions that represent an approach to cost effectiveness in the use of educational media are these: All things being equal, what does it cost? What can I buy for a small increment in cost? What is the critical mass necessary to produce educational results? Can I find others to share the cost? Can the  rules be rewritten so that the price is right? Some of the difficulties in applying cost effectiveness analysis to education are that education is an open system; effectiveness, not efficiency is the better criterion; financing may be difficult; and so may measurement. What is needed to make educational technology effective is the critical mass to produce quality materials and regional networks for large audiences. Media systems, utilizing television and computers, will be used when they come to be regarded as necessities. (MF)",

The lesson plans tested were: (1) the accepted method (teacher-presentation of all material), (2) interest as a guide (each child followed his own inclination), (3) question and investigation (the interest of the child was stimulated by pertinent questions), (4) fairy story method, (5) a comparison of the life and art of two ancient civilizations, (6) an introduction to the gallery experience by slides and a lecture, (7) schoolroom preparation before the museum visit (either a day ahead or a week ahead), (8)  drawing method (the child answered questions by drawing), and (9) the instructive story method. The material chosen for the study was Egyptian. For children of high intelligence, plans 7 (one-week preparation), 3, 8, and 7 (one-day preparation) were of most value, in that order. For children of fair intelligence, plans 3, 8, and 7 (one-day preparation), in that order, were markedly superior. One of the general observations was that too much material was presented at a single lesson in all of the plans. New plans and further experiments are suggested. (MF)",

However, increased concentration of facts in the films yielded only slight advantages in learning. The films differed in length as well as in factual content: the Long Heavy version ran 29 minutes and contained 224 facts; the Long Light version also ran 29 minutes but contained only 112 facts; the Short Heavy version ran 14 minutes and contained 112 facts; the Short Light version ran 14 minutes and contained 56 facts. All groups (those who saw the film and control groups who did not) took the same 136 item multiple-choice question information test. For the high  school sample the Short Heavy version seemed to be the most effective; for the Air Force and college samples the Long Light version seemed to be most effective. At the end of the delayed recall period all differences in learning attributable to the several versions were much smaller than they had been on the immediate retention test, and most of them were not signficant. In no case did the Long Heavy film group learn twice as much as the Short Heavy or Long Light groups, nor did the latter learn twice as much as the Short Light group. (Author/MF)",

The first part of the study was concerned with film introductions. In it, three films were selected from 130 instructional films as having what seemed to be good introductory sequences. Two versions of each of the three films were prepared, one including the intoduction and one omitting it. Each film was shown to three comparable groups of high school students; a control group which did not see the film, a group which saw the film version without the introduction, and a group which saw the  entire film. All the film groups gained higher scores than the control groups which did not see a film. However, the learning differences attributable to the films were small: positive for two films and negative for one. In evaluating the effect on learning of summary sequences, the same procedure was followed as in evaluation of the effect of introductory sequences, with similar results. (MF)",

The experimental population included 319 college freshmen enrolled in 12 sections of science survey classes. The experimental groups were first given a pretest composed of a scramble of the individual film tests. The films were then shown in rotation as indicated above. In every case the difference between the pretest and posttest scores was highly significant, indicating that every group learned from each film. Showing them twice resulted in appreciably more  learning; showings after the first two contributed little more to learning, and the drop-off was very rapid. (MF)",

These versions were termed: basic, visual relevant, visual irrelevant, sound relevant, and sound irrelevant. Attention-gaining devices were placed at the same points in all but the basic version. The experiment was conducted with two populations--Army recruits and Navy recruits--randomly divided into six comparable groups. Each of five groups were shown one of the experimental film versions and, afterwards, were tested for learning of factual information and for recall of the attention devices. The sixth (control) group took the information test without seeing the film. No evidence was found that relevant devices add to the  effectiveness of an informational film. There was evidence that irrelevant sound devices detract. No significant difference was found between the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of visual and sound devices. Ability to recognize and remember which devices were used in a film version was practically independent of learning from that version. On the basis of these findings, the recommendation is made that producers of training films present the subject matter in a simple, straightforward way. (MF)",

Evaluation of the teaching ability of museum docents is a variable worthy of further study.

The children dictated their own stories in their own Afro-American dialect on dictaphone belts. A computer furnished printouts of the stories for the children to read. They could also hear their own words played back on recordings made by the teacher. Each new word a student used was recorded by the computer; thus a running record of a child's vocabulary development was created. Reading progress was achieved by introducing students to standard English usage through composite stories. These were standard English versions of the pupil's own dictation and gave him a chance to recognize  his own words and thoughts in a different context. Periodic tests were given to evaluate the students' progress and needs. The computer printed out a weekly pupil progress report which the teacher used to prescribe corrective steps. Present cost per student for the DORVACK approach is $770 above the regular district expenditure of $658. Parent support for the program is very good; and parents of children not in the program are asking for an expansion of the program to include all the children. (MF)",

        "description":"Although educational radio has been part of the American scene for nearly half a century, it does not enjoy the governmental participation and national commitment that it receives in many other countries. The position of educational radio did improve with the advent of Frequency Modulation (FM) broadcasting, and today there are more than 450 educational radio stations. Radio offers education an ear to the world, timely information, emotional impact, and a sense of involvement. It is currently used for curriculum innovation, in-service teacher training, continuing professional education, community service, and vocational education. A systems approach to education has combined radio with other media: printed materials, filmstrips, television, and tape recordings. Other cooperative  media approaches have been made possible by FM multiplex equipment. Experimental studies have indicated that radio is as effective in teaching as the &quot;conventional methods,&quot; and that its lack of visual elements is not necessarily a drawback. While radio, like all mass media, lacks the reciprocity and flexibility found in interpersonal discourse, some of these difficulties have been alleviated by recent technical developments. Apathy and financing are still problems. Yet, in comparison with other media, radio is impressively economical. (MF)",

Their reactions were favorable, with music educators rating the films higher than non-musicians. Judgments of the music were upwards of 83% favorable for all productions. Some of the ideas that emerged from the free comments of the viewers were that films designed as teaching aids should be composed with one central idea, details should be delegated to film guides, color photography is desirable,  visual variety is essential, format should vary with purpose, and length should depend upon material. All viewers agreed that the final result should be aesthetically pleasing. A tremendous need was expressed by the viewers for all kinds of musical films. Teaching guides are given in the appendices.

The rate for television microwave service may be as low as $27.50 per mile for the so-called &quot;ETV Tariff,&quot; or as high as $90.00 per mile for the tariff 260 used by most commercial stations and networks. There are instances where the television broadcaster or system user can do his own microwave portions to his advantage, but this is not true in all situations. When microwave needs get to multiple channels, several relays, or  requires special performance conditions, the user should consider leasing the service from qualified carriers rather than attempting to do it himself. The user can minimize his costs by acquainting himself with the possibilities and by making wise choices. (MF)",

        "description":"The socializing role of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) was seen to be a positive one in this study. The students, predominantly Mexican-American, who experienced CAI, and other students, in a control group, who did not, liked the computer. They thought it gave the right answers and they respected it as having a vast array of information available to it. They also saw it as fair, trusted its evaluations as well as its handling of task assignments, and sometimes attributed to it an almost human role. Feelings of greater trust in the learning situation managed via computer as compared to a learning situation monitored by a teacher were especially evident among CAI students. On the other hand, while both groups tended to ascribe charismatic qualities to the computer rather than  to the teacher, CAI students were more aware than their Non-CAI peers of the computer's unresponsiveness to students' eventual desires to change the course or the content of its lessons. Greater confidence in the computer as compared to the teacher may follow from the fact that the teacher is perceived as evaluating student performance in mathematics tasks on the basis of behavior not related to these tasks.

These conditions are: (1) the public expectation of quick and sure responses from the R and D effort, and (2) the genuine wish for increased democratization in society and increased responsiveness on the part of its institutions. For management this will mean: (1) the need to increase the scope of involvement and the human sensitivity of the planning and decision-making processes in the R and D policy and priority setting sector; (2) new mechanisms for evoking responsive corporate behavior to achieve desirable collegial and group productivity; and (3) increased clarity in communications and differentiated products if better practices  based on research knowledge are to find their way into the schools and improve learning environments. The paper also reviews federal involvement in educational research, comparative expenditures in different areas for research, the need for more research, development, and training in administration and management, the proposal for the creation of a National Institute of Education, the kind of climate that must be created to encourage potentially effective R and D, and the skills a manager of R and D will need.

        "description":"The University of California considers the faculty/student ratio a principal determinant of quality. Requests made by the University for new faculty positions are based on the student/faculty ratios proposed by the University in its 5-year program for each campus. Given the forecasts of student enrollments, these proposed ratios determine the required increase in faculty positions. What the ideal ratio is depends on the Regent's policy guidelines and these may change over the years. The difference between the University's request for new positions and the number approved by the state poses a difficult problem for the administration, and this paper addresses itself to that problem. It formulates and solves a mathematical model used to calculate lower and upper bounds on the number  of new faculty positions allocated, over a finite planning horizon, to a multicampus educational institution. In this model the student/faculty ratios must meet certain growth rate restrictions imposed by the faculty and the administration. The initial student/faculty ratios, forecasts of student enrollments, and certain critical ratios are assumed known and given. (AF)",

It considers first the importance of the cost in higher education in determining whether or not a potential, qualified student will actually enroll. Methods are then illustrated for estimating the student's ability to pay and the cost of higher education to the student. Comparisons of the ability to pay and the cost factors provide estimates of the percentage of potential students who are effectively \"priced out\" of higher education. This approach may be used by public or private institutions to study proposed changes in tuition or scholarship policies. The techniques can also be applied to the analysis of the problem of whether to expand existing physical  facilities to provide for growing enrollments, or establish new institutions in heavily populated urban centers.

Members of groups previously not well represented on boards of trustees--Negroes, women, and people under age 40--have been added in considerable numbers. This study draws on data gathered in a 1969 national survey of over 5,000 trustees (see College and University Trustees: Their Backgrounds, Roles, and Educational Attitudes, Educational Testing Service, 1969), and examines in detail the characteristics of these previously underrepresented subgroups. It is concluded that continued increases of these people on college governing boards will probably tend to have a liberalizing influence on the overall orientations of most boards of trustees.

While most of the research provides support for the validity of the examinations as measures of academic achievement in college, the results of many of the studies have alternative explanations. Correlations between the GE's and college grades obtained concurrently are moderately positive, but the validities of the tests for predicting success in upper-level studies are significantly lower. The GE's are also correlated positively with the amount of previous college experience. Significant gains on the tests are generally made by students over the first 2 years of  college and the highest scores on each test are obtained by students intending to major in the subject covered by the test. The GE's relationship to other tests is also discussed, as well as their appropriateness for adults. (AF)",

Two commentaries by Joseph L. Knutson and Jeff Johnson follow this paper. The second paper is &quot;What's so Special about a Lutheran College?&quot; by Louis Almen.

Students were classified by sex and whether they were regular students or high-risk students. Conceptual differences were found between high-risk and regular students. The rebirth of pride in being black was reflected by the high-risk students on all factors. White males tended to be more negative in their feelings toward blacks than white females as far as evaluation was concerned. Blacks had significantly lower acceptance of whites than did whites of  blacks on evaluation. Blacks tended to be more racially sensitive than whites.

Great dissatisfaction with mass education has arisen within the world of education itself, and perhaps more serious, the growing politicization of higher education has created problems concerning continued public support for an ever larger and presumably more influential higher education community. An adversary culture is now firmly entrenched in higher education. Unlike the assertions of many, this does not represent a change from, but a continuity with earlier forms of campus politics. The intellectuals' propensity to condemn in the sixties what they helped formulate in the fifties has only helped to further the  breach between the public and the university. The President, in his message to Congress, proposed a program in which Federal subsidies would be used in such a way that resources available to the poor students are brought up to the level of middle income students. There has been little or no reaction to this or to the proposal for the creation of a National Foundation for Higher Education from Congress or the Campus. Statesmanship will be needed to preserve both the independence of the institutions and their viability as stable and creative instruments in society. (AF)",

A questionnaire designed to assess student opinions toward and possible behavioral changes resulting from P-F courses was sent to a random sample of sophomores, juniors and seniors enrolled in the Spring of 1969 who had originally entered the University before the Fall of 1968. Of 6,700 questionnaires distributed, 3,400 useable ones were returned. The major findings were: (1) the vast majority of students want the P-F option continued; (2) most students would have taken P-F courses for regular grades (R-G) had the P-F option not existed; (3) most P-F courses are taken for the relief they afford from grading pressure; (4)  most students reported working less hard in P-F courses than in R-G courses; (5) roughly two-thirds of the students had not taken P-F courses in the Spring of 1969; and (6) roughly two-thirds of the students at the University will have taken P-F courses before graduation.

The student who is totally committed to the American Dream is increasingly rare. Students have realized that the end is here and now, the future and the present are one, and that life is in the living. Students have a real fear concerning the Bomb, the hot-line and America's preoccupation with \"honorable\" victory, regardless of cost. The draft is another cause of students' orientation to the present, and an increasing number of young men are staying in college to avoid the draft, or are risking imprisonment for resisting the draft. College students reject the materialistic, affluent way of life of  their parents, they are increasingly committed to living just for today. Students engage much more openly in sexual relationships, and are increasingly more willing to risk jail sentences and criminal records. Many students lack plans after graduation and reject the status and prestige sought by their parents. Students are almost unanimously concerned about the ecological problems facing society. (AF)",

Sixty-eight percent of those responding viewed protest activities on their campuses as having specific \"educational\" benefits. The benefit most often cited was \"real world education\"; other benefits cited were: the impetus some activities gave to the regular curriculum, increasing student motivation to learn, a reexamination of the purposes of education, and a change in faculty-student relationship. Eleven percent of the faculty saw no benefits from the protest activities, and 79 percent expressed concern for the negative  effects. Sixty-five percent felt the positive aspects outweighed the negative, while 23 percent felt the opposite. Seventy-seven percent indicated they generally supported the protests, and 52 percent said that they had made some changes in their classroom activities or policies.

Seventy percent of the questionnaires were returned. The purpose of the questionnaire was to determine faculty attitudes toward educational change and to learn more about the characteristics of those who favored change as contrasted to those who did not. The results indicated that the majority of faculty members favored change, but there were sharp differences between those who did and those who did not. The faculty who favored change were more likely to see the purpose of college education as self-development in students, emphasized personalization in the educative process, held permissive views about student personal life, believed in a  theory of teaching and learning emphasizing the self-motivating power of students, and favored giving students significant roles in academic and social policymaking. They tended to be from the junior ranks, politically liberal, non-religious, and taught in the humanities or the social sciences. Those opposed to academic change wanted students to acquire vocational and technical competence, deemphasized the need for close faculty-student relationship, emphasized external motivation, and opposed student participation in governance. Most were from the senior ranks, more conservative, and religious. (AF)",

        "description":"The creation of cluster colleges was in response to the serious problems facing undergraduate education: the impersonality of large institutions, the limited resources of small schools, and the irrelevance of academic programs. There are two types of cluster college: (1) a federation of usually small schools, with each college maintaining its corporate independence, and (2) the more common type: the subcollege, which is an academic subunit of a larger corporate body. This paper concludes that cluster colleges: (1) foster a greater sense of community and encourage closer student-faculty relationships than do larger and undifferentiated portions of the same school; (2) are vehicles for innovation both by virtue of their novel educational programs and because they attract faculty  and students who are interested in and supportive of these efforts; and (3) provide the structured diversity and alternative programs that can meet the needs of a wide range of students better than a single, undifferentiated university.

When compared to students in a control group, the students who chose the student-designed courses were less interested in college as a means of vocational preparation, more oriented toward effecting social change, more aesthetically inclined, and more concerned with interpersonal relationships. They were very dissatisfied with the irrelevance of their academic education. One third of the control group, however, also expressed dissatisfaction with the more traditional courses. The students in the student-initiated courses were characterized by autonomy and independence and were more likely to seek  out and create experiences personally relevant to themselves. To encourage initiative, procedures must be established that allow independent students to create their own, personally relevant alternatives. Alternative curricula are also needed to encourage the less autonomous students to seek out new experiences and thereby develop greater initiative. (AF)",

According to Holland a person's behavior can be explained by the interaction of his personality pattern with his environment. The Holland &quot;environment&quot; includes six categories: realistic, intellectual, social, conventional, enterprising, and artistic. An attempt was made to answer the following questions: (1) are students assigned to a living unit according to Holland's theory more cohesive than students in a mixed house? (2) how do the attitudes of these two groups of students about their living unit compare? and (3) how does their academic achievement compare. The  study included 3 &quot;realistic&quot;, 1 &quot;intellectual&quot;, 1 &quot;enterprising&quot; and 1 control group.

There are overall discrepancies between salaries of men and women of comparable rank, with the size of the discrepancy increasing with rank. Ten percent of the associate professors are women, but only 5 percent of the full professors, indicating that women are &quot;frozen&quot; at the associate level. The argument that women's salaries are low because of inferior performance is refuted by the fact that in no case is a woman earning the lowest salary of her rank. (AF)",

CUES is probably the most widely used instrument for describing college environments. The purposes of this study were to: (1) provide more adequate national norms--documenting the range of institutional diversity on each of the items and scales in CUES and the varieties and major types of profiles; (2) undertake a thorough reanalysis of CUES items and scales and other psychometric properties of the instrument; (3) establish a wider network of relationships between CUES scores and a variety of other institutional characteristics; and (4) give the National Opinion Research Center  (NORC) information about college environments which would enable them to probe more deeply into the determinants of educational and career choices of college students. One hundred institutions served as a national reference group for the psychometric studies. Eight types of environments were identified. The psychometric properties of the current edition of CUES were found to be generally adequate but capable of improvement. (AF)",

These were: (1) chemists and physicists, (2) engineers,  (3) college teachers, (4) lawyers, and (5) salesmen. Nine discriminant variables were identified. These included: (1) age, (2) father's occupation, (3) mother's occupation, (4) score on SAT, (5) senior year average grade, (6) scholastic honors received at Yale, (7) involvement in fraternities, (8) academic, sports and social clubs, and (9) dramatics, publications and musical organizations.

Two college courses were studied concurrently and four different teaching conditions were utilized in each course. A comprehensive battery of personality inventories was administered to each of the students, and three types of criterion measures were collected in both courses. Chapter 1 presents the problem. Chapter 2 discusses the methodology of the project and details the procedures used in the two experimental courses. Chapter 3 focuses on the main effects: those due to treatment variables (i.e., the relationships between the instructional conditions and the course  outcomes) and those arising from the personality variables (i.e., the relationships between scale scores and the criterion measures). Chapter 4 presents the major trait-by-treatment interactions based upon the a priori personality scales. Chapter 5 describes the construction of new empirical interaction scales and presents the results using this strategy of scale construction. Chapter 6 reviews and discusses the major findings, and Chapter 7 summarizes the report. (Author/AF)",

Particular attention was given to the identification of learner variables associated with performance in 2 different teaching-learning environments: independent study without student-professor contact and the classroom environment involving student-professor contact in which a combination of lecture and discussion was used. Each student in introductory sociology was allowed to choose whether he would be a regular class attender or whether he would be a non-attender (self-study with attendance only for objective tests). Each of these 2 categories was subsequently divided into (1) those who had  performed less well. The differences among these 4 categories on mental, demographic, and social-psychological variables were analyzed using the method of elaboration. Many differences were found between those who chose to attend and not to attend and those of each of these categories whose sociology grade was higher than their GPA.

The course objectives are to provide students with an understanding of the relationship between the internal structures and the properties of engineering materials, and to promote students' understanding of how internal structures can be altered to produce desired properties. To help students understand those course materials whose mastery has been consistently problematic, a series of films and slides were devised. To evaluate the effectiveness of these multimedia, audiovisual techniques, the students taking the course were divided into 3 groups: Group I, the control group, was taught in the  usual manner; Group II saw the slides and films, but had no special opportunity to review or discuss them; and Group III saw the slides and films, but had also additional learning assignments using audiovisual techniques. The results indicated that the 3 groups did not differ on their total final examination scores, but did differ on their media-related scores. This report discusses these results, and some additional findings of the study, such as the students' feelings about their learning, their attitude toward learning, student characteristics and the predictive validity of the tests in terms of determining what kind of students should be recruited.

Two papers on faculty participation in college governance (included with these proceedings) formed the basis for a discussion on that topic. A presentation of resolutions passed and recommendations made for the 1971 conference concluded the final session of the 1970 Lake Arrowhead Conference. (RC)",

        "description":"Because Florida has an eight-year lead on Illinois in the coordination and articulation of curricula between the public junior colleges and universities, some of the curricular problems encountered by Florida educational planners are presented in this resource paper, with recommendations for the Illinois Junior College Board. Following a summary of the legal basis for curriculum coordination and articulation, the author suggests, as a first step, uniform general education requirements among all institutions of higher education. Using Florida as an example, general education requirements for several junior colleges in that state and admission requirements for two Florida universities that offer only upper-division courses are outlined. Advanced placement and transfer policies are  also discussed. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the basis for state planning and junior college research. A chapter on articulation by subject area is also included. The final chapter summarizes progress in articulation programs in both Florida and Illinois. The ten recommendations resulting from this study are listed. They include suggestions for various on-going discussion groups among junior college representatives and for uniform policies regarding general education requirements, transfer programs, and advanced placement programs.

The influence of these three men, as well as others, represented the downward extension of higher education and, consequently, the creation of the two-year college.

This survey sought to identify potential problem areas and to determine in what areas further study was needed. Thirty-three instructors (66 per cent)--all teaching in the social sciences--responded. Twenty-nine of them were tenured. Results indicate that existing or expected restrictions on academic freedom in this district represent a serious problem and require further study. Thirty-nine per cent (13) reported some restriction on freedom to discuss certain controversial issues in class; 30 per cent (10) said they had experienced some form of overt pressure to avoid class discussion of such  issues. The Board of Trustees was seen as the prime source of restriction. Three respondents felt restricted in discussing certain issues because colleagues or students were informing the board about the classroom activities; however, most felt that their greatest support also came from these two groups. They felt that the AFT, faculty senate, and AAUP provided the greatest professional support. In defining academic freedom, most saw it as a freedom from arbitrary restrictions or pressures, limited by reasonable standards of good taste.

        "description":"The development of more detailed information about potential costs of post-high school education at less than the baccalaureate degree level was the purpose of this study. Fifteen comprehensive community-junior colleges in seven states were selected to provide input data on target population, patterns of financial support, anticipated support needs, and program cost differentials. To determine the cost of educating a student in particular curricula, six related studies were conducted. Following are some of the significant findings of the study. First of all, the potential student population by 1980 will range from 4.5 million to 12 million. In addition, junior colleges would require at least $6.2 billion (in 1969 dollars) by 1980, if one projects anticipated needs from current  expenditures. In the past, local funds and student tuition have been the major sources of financial support; however, there appears to be a trend toward state support, and an increasing emphasis on federal funds. Finally, in analyzing the cost differentials of various programs, it appears that--except for business-related courses--occupational programs are more expensive to operate than general education programs. In some instances, the differential exceeds 100 per cent, and can be even greater if equipment cost estimates are included. (JO)",

Since the Commission on Higher Education, appointed by President Truman in 1947, estimated that at least 49 per cent of the population had the mental ability to complete 14 years of schooling, various national committees and organizations have likewise supported this view. Now open-door institutions have come to be expected by much of the American public. Graphs illustrating enrollment trends over approximately the last 20 years support maintenance of the open-door philosophy. Other arguments for keeping the door open are the cost benefit and the manpower training which take into account the cost and benefit to the individual as well as the cost and  benefit to society for an individual's attendance at college. Tables are included to illustrate the relationship between education and income and the amount of education demanded for various occupations. (RC)",

        "description":"This research review focuses on the need for active cooperation between the university-based researcher and the junior college administrator, to provide the research on teaching and learning necessary for the sound preparation of junior college teachers. Historically, the junior college's main concern has been student learning, and time available for activities like research was at a minimum. On the other hand, such research is of primary interest to those engaged in junior college studies at the university. One indication of the current level of cooperation is the tendency of administrators--especially those engaged in selecting new teachers--to ignore existing research on which qualities are characteristic of the properly prepared teacher. For example, the applicant's teaching  ability, theories of learning, course objectives, or knowledge of the junior college commonly are not major selection criteria. Also notable is the negative attitude that many junior college administrators show towards accepting teaching interns. The uniqueness of the junior college role and environment suggests that those who teach there should receive training oriented toward particular needs. Thus, not only must the researcher be knowledgeable about current institutional practices, but also the practitioner must be aware of and contribute toward research. Accepting this, it should be obvious that the quality of both current teaching practice and existing research depends on mutual cooperation. (JO)",

An evaluation depends on thorough research. As research resources for the community colleges are meager, it is necessary for the individual college to make effective use of available materials, to pool its information with other  community colleges, and to consult and collaborate with relevant university-based research centers.

The extent of protest at junior colleges, however, is underestimated by junior college administrators, faculty, and the general public. In a survey of 841 junior college deans of students, 231 (37.7 per cent of the 613 who responded) reported 1.586 incidents of student protest during the 1968-69 academic year. The most frequent issues were: (1) student-administration affairs regarding institutional services, dress and living regulations, and grievance procedures; (2) off-campus interests in military service and civil rights; (3) instruction; (4) faculty; and (5) freedom of expression. The greatest percentage of students, however, protested tuition charges, residence and  student drinking regulations, and mandatory attendance at school functions. While geographic location is not related to student activism, the larger and urban junior colleges have more protests than smaller and rural or suburban colleges. To minimize the number and severity of protests, it is necessary to develop effective communications between students and college officials to make necessary instructional and institutional reforms, and to give students and faculty more power in governing their affairs. The junior colleges must examine their philosophies and goals in an effort to be increasingly responsive to student and community needs. (CA)",

It was found that the state universities will generally accept credit, with a few restrictions, in agricultural courses earned in junior and community colleges, but will not accept credit from area vocational or technical schools. Credit in agricultural courses taken in 2-year colleges outside the state will transfer to another state university with fewer restrictions than will credit earned in the same state. Few junior and community college teachers are required to meet any state certification standards. State  universities assume that instructors hold masters degrees in the subjects taught. More than half the universities surveyed share course material with junior and community colleges, but only on a request basis. Fifty-five per cent of the Deans of Resident Instruction feel that students experience little or no difficulty in transferring from a 2-year college to a 4-year college.

To solve these problems the college has turned its attention to organization below the level of the administrative council and staff positions. Of three alternatives, further refining the organization of existing faculty and staff with provision for the next and succeeding years was found to be the most desirable. It has been proposed that faculty be organized into groups (no more than 30 per group) without specific regard for curriculum, course, or discipline; these faculty \"clusters\" would then include individuals with specific and general teaching and administrative strengths. Key faculty members would be selected to head these clusters  according to their versatility and ability to recognize and encourage different modes of instruction, commitment to student learning, and ability to foster cooperation with other faculty members. Students are then assigned to the clusters, first artibrarily and then specifically according to their majors, interests, and needs. The result will be a \"college within a college.\" The greatest advantage of such an organization is that the diversity of talents within a cluster will enable the faculty to concentrate on student learning rather than on subject matter.

The nature and scope of a survey and its ultimate use depends on the characteristics of the college conducting the survey and the community it serves. When planning a survey concerning occupational education, the needs, interests, and aspirations of those to be surveyed (employer and potential employee) should be considered. It is necessary to have initial and on-going surveys to  evaluate accurately enrollment potential in the overall planning process for occupational education. To insure maximum use of survey feedback, the final report can be used as a basis for a seminar for faculty, administration, advisory committee members, and potential employers. (CA)",

The results of this study showed that the Hamline University was not meeting the information needs of the faculty and students. Based on the prediction that informational material will continue to increase in amount and diversity and that user needs will follow the same trend, it was apparent that, if the library continued to operate in the traditional mode, its contribution to the educational program would become progressively less significant. Thus, it was recommended that the library increase both services and resources by adding a switching center  service. This service would establish a detailed specification of user information requirements and attempt to satisfy these requirements either through the collection at the Hamline University library or by tapping the collections and services available at other information centers. With these arrangements the library could provide information support for all aspects of the educational program. The workability of the switching center system was demonstrated. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"The Committee to Investigate Copyright Problems (CICP), a non-profit organization dedicated to resolving the conflict known as the &quot;copyright photocopying problem&quot; was joined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), a large national publisher of technical and scientific standards, in a plan to simulate a long-proposed solution to the problem. This is a non-profit, voluntary system of access-permissions-and-payments called a copyright clearinghouse (CHC). A moratorium contract between ASTM and its client organizations guaranteed against infringement in making up to 50 multiple copies at a time of any ASTM publication. In return these organizations supplied CICP with data for analysis of their copying. Both CICP and ASTM pledged their support for transforming the  experiment into a permanent, national CHC. At this point Government support for CICP suddently ended. CICP became inactive, while volunteers in ASTM, CICP and elsewhere carried on the reduced and modified collection and analysis of moratorium data. This report analyzes the data obtainable, finds a number of facts useful for copyright and CHC economics, and supports the hypothesis that such a system would largely resolve the copyright photocopying problem. A renewed effort is recommended, starting with more extensive and intensive studies. (Author/NH)",

In 1965, PPBS was adopted in the civil sector of the Federal Government. Since 1965, interest in and adoption of PPBS has spread beyond the Federal Government and now also includes the library community. It is hoped this presentation will: (1) increase the effectiveness of the work of the library community, (2) help define precisely what role the library should play within the  existing plethora of information centers, (3) help librarians visualize the potential utility of PPBS to enable libraries to participate more effectively in decisions affecting their contributions to their establishments and (4) encourage librarians to explore PPBS further and take steps toward PPBS training, development, and application as appropriate in their respective environments.

The dimension which has been conspicuously absent in library statistics is interpretation of the data which is reported, and the correlation of one set of data with another to reach a defensible conclusion. For the most part, librarians have been data-gathering rather than statistics producing. The analysis and the creative juxtaposition of quantitative measures to deduce qualitative factors is the very essence of the art of statistics. Major recommendations include: (1) statistics should compare your library last year with your library this year, and five years hence; (2) the data gathered should be meaningful to your library; (3) sampling  techniques and contact with experts who deal with the problems our work touches upon should be tried and (4) national or state reporting should not take precedence over statistical analysis that is relevant to your library.

In the worst case, items can be squared, although such a large increase is extremely unlikely. In any case, the number of individual data elements involved has to increase as a result of changing to a program planned budgeting system, which necessarily increases the justification for using data processing equipment. In principle, data processing functions involved in this type of budget allocation and analysis are not different from the performance of the same function for any  other type of budgeting system.

Two important items in the programming phase are: (1) the question of incremental development of a capital complex and (2) the whole problem of time phasing of a capital project. Design preparation is divided into three steps: (1) schematic drawings, (2) preliminary plans and (3) final plans and drawings.

This is followed by an account of the historical antecedents of PPB and related developments. The role of GAO is described as being broader than the specific interests of most congressional committees. The growing interest of Congress in analysis and information systems is indicated by several recent proposals introduced in both houses which are directed to this matter. Economic Opportunity Programs  are investigated and a survey of PPB in the Executive Branch is presented. It is concluded that the interest expressed by the Congress in improved program review and analysis has been representative of both older and newer members and also has been representative of both parties.

It is another attempt to relate the resources or funds to the goals or objectives of an organization. However, in CUA, the emphasis is on quantification and precise measures, and draws upon the analytical tools of many disciplines, such as mathematics, operations research, and computer science. The limitations and disadvantages of CUA are  summarized. In spite of the problems and limitations of the CUA aspect of PPBS, it can be extremely valuable when used properly.

The first task for an analyst is to understand how decisions are actually made in his government. This means that one must understand very clearly how decisions are actually being made before one sets out to do an analysis. The discussion concentrated mainly on service organizations within government, however, the same logic applies to services to segments of the public except that the  identification of target groups of intended beneficiaries is a very important consideration here.

Librarianship as an educational factor has become increasingly important during the past half century with respect to its quantitative growth and its quality world-wide. Although the school system will always occupy the primary role in erudition and education, knowledge and cognition must also be acquired through the individual efforts of the pupil or student. Libraries are the greatest and most approachable source for acquiring, creating and conserving information but many public libraries have been lax in developing services adequate for the requirements of society. The furthering of the effectiveness and the educational  and eruditional endeavors of libraries and augmentation of their social importance require the creation of a specific pedalogical discipline. In Slovakia, the term &quot;biblio-paedogogics&quot; covers that discipline whose sphere covers scientific research and theoretical interest beyond that of work with the reader in the library, handling books and the like. Its development is one of the principal conditions for development of the public library as an educational factor. (AB)",

These bibliographies are known as state bibliographies. This report dwells on the characteristics of the organization of a state bibliographic system in a multi-national socialistic state. The system of current state bibliographies which include approximately 40 publications (or &quot;chronicles&quot;), gives a clear view of printed matter in the Soviet Union. This system of &quot;chronicles&quot; ensures full registration and information about: books; pamphlets, magazines; newspapers; serials; transactions; music; graphic works; geographical, historical and astronomical maps and atlases; and provides within certain limitations, information about  official, instructive and other publications for restrictive use. Despite the impressive amount of material reflected in the &quot;chronicles,&quot; the libraries and scholars insist on further extension of sources represented in the analytical bibliographies, their scope and criteria of selection of the listed material.

Central statistical libraries in Europe were first regarded as administrative and archival libraries. Their early holdings of foreign publications in applied statistics, resulting from direct international exchange agreements and exceeding in percentage quite often the stocks of statistical publications of their own country, made them to a certain extent the forerunners of today's much more comprehensive independent libraries of social sciences. The need to cope with the specific acceleration in the growth of stocks, with the continuous change statistics undergo and  with the growing tendency towards a concentration on the most recent data only, will change the library character to that of a documentation centre in the near future.

University libraries should supply timely differentiated bibliographical and factual information to the research institutes and laboratories in many universities first.

In order to provide this large population living in a vast area with the opportunity of using library books, a broad and ramified network of library institutions had to be organized which would make it possible to bring the library closer to the people's homes or place of work. At present there are a little over 122,000 public libraries of which 35,000 serve the urban population and nearly 87,000 serve the rural population. There are an average of 1,900 readers per library. There are 1,193,590,000 books, magazines, brochures or an average of 5.0 books per capita in the libraries' collections. Factors which will have a decisive effect on the  organizational structure of the public library network are: (1) changes in the socio-demographical structure of the urban and rural populations, (2) more free time, (3) higher level of knowledge and professional qualifications, (4) expansion principles of populated localities of various types and structures, (5) preferential industrial or agricultural development of certain territories and (6) development of interdepartmental co-operation and co-ordination of planning.

On a nation-wide scale the one library which is best equipped to perform such centralized functions will be the national library, which has the richest collections and reference apparatus, adequate financial support and trained staff. The national library should be viewed not separately but in interrelationship with other libraries of the country, within their general framework. Considering the national library as a systems object implies that its typological functions are correlated and interdependent. The following categorization of typological functions is suggested: (1) a state repository of publications, (2) a major public library in the country, (3) an information and bibliographic center, (4) a  methodological guidance center and (5) a co-ordination center. These five functions determine the nature and scope of collections, the pattern of their use and the role of the national library in the organization of library service within a country.

(2) Some experts regard library science as the higher ranking activity with bibliology integrated into library science; others view the order in the reverse. (3) Library science is considered by some as an integrated branch embracing all disciplines of this domain; others consider bibliology as an integrated branch embracing all branches including publishing. (4) Librarianship, with all its related disciplines, has no scientific  character; it is considered to be a practical branch; its theory constitutes a special doctrine. In Slovakia librarianship is a branch of independent university study, however, it is not acknowledged as a branch of science. Endeavors to integrate librarianship and its related branches into one scientific group called library science which would be equal with other scientific disciplines were not successful.

The term &quot;recommendatory&quot; was introduced before the Revolution by the well-known bibliographer, N.A. Rubakin. The term has been preserved but the volume and contents of its concept have changed and become more complicated. During the first years of Soviet power recommendatory bibliography helped wipe out illiteracy and cultural backwardness in the rural population, often substituting for school and teacher. Now it promotes knowledge in conjunction with secondary and higher schools or becomes the foundation of post-school education of the Soviet people. The system of recommendatory bibliography handbooks embraces the most urgent themes, problems and branches of knowledge, that arouse wide social  interest and meet the most typical requirements of the Soviet people in the field of general education. Manuals of recommendatory bibliography give more detailed information on books than any other sources of mass information. The main general principle of recommendatory bibliography is strict selection of good quality literature easily understood by readers. A Lenin State Library study shows that the recommendatory bibliography increases book demands in libraries and promotes general spiritual development of readers. (NH)",

However, until recently, international cooperation mainly boiled down to mutual patent document exchanges. These libraries did not participate in various international associations. A meeting of the heads of patent libraries of the CMEA country-members held in Moscow in 1970, proved that there are opportunities for extending cooperation between patent libraries. One of the main problems facing these libraries is the organization of the patent description collections according to the union classification system of the International Patent Cataloging (IPC). Only the first steps have been made in the transition  to the IPC system, since the patent departments are classifying only new patent description publications according to this system. Another important problem is the organization of the retrospective exchange of the descriptions of inventions and information publications. Patent libraries should exchange opinions about the forms which further cooperation among them should take. (NH)",

The Chi-square test applied in matrix analysis revealed that relationships exist  between the reading of a library book or not and whether the reader is a student or not, between major field of study and the sex of the reader, and between place of residence of the reader, on the one hand and the sex and class year of reader, on the other.

Searching an ATS document line-by-line is a time consuming process requiring slow printout speeds. A search can operate only upon 9,999 lines of text at any one time. Working storage limitations make it necessary to maintain a quantity of separate ATS documents in permanent storage; each of which is brought in as needed and then returned to storage, so that a series of duplicate searches is necessary if the total file exceeds 9,999 lines. Storage costs as well as access limitations indicate that ATS work is practical only with relatively small and highly fluid files, unless it is used purely for data capture and text editing functions. Costs can  be reduced by putting data into off-line storage when not needed and later returning it to the system, but this is not very practical in the present system configuration. To be accessible, data must be maintained in a rigid ATS format. Random searching cannot be done except in a very limited sense. In general, this project was considered worthwhile as a demonstration of the potential and limitations of terminal systems such as ATS. (MF)",

The legislature, 12 agencies of the State government, and the three principal retirement agencies are included in State Government. The discussion of State Government covers current status and projected requirements, cost/benefit, and the State government systems plan (Minnesota Information and Decision Systems--MIDS). Minnesota's five systems of higher education were examined: (1) to determine specific objectives and uses of  computers to meet them; (2) to summarize existing computing facilities; (3) to analyze computer facilities and services over the next five and ten years; (4) to determine costs; and (5) to recommend ways to meet needs and to lay a basis for future development. The status of mechanization at the local government level was determined by the use of questionnaires. The business of local government is particularly susceptible to assistance from computerization, but usually they have not been in a position to take advantage of this. Recommendations and guidelines for the efficient development of local government information systems and computerization are discussed. (SG)",

Subjects were 32 disadvantaged children who were assigned to two experimental groups of eight each and a control group of 16. Eight advantaged children were added to each of the experimental groups. Teachers assigned to all three classes were similar in experience, teaching style and demographic characteristics. Variables of chief interest in this study were cognition, language, and socialization. Pre- and posttests on a variety of standardized and specially developed instruments evaluated the performance of all children. Videotapes were used to assess socio-emotional behaviors such as  aggression and dependency. When comparisons were made between control and experimental groups results indicated support for increased educability in classes holding a higher percentage of advantaged peers. Consistent gains were evident although significance at the .05 level was not reached. The experimental children gained in task persistence and verbal skills; aggressive and dependent behaviors decreased; and self concepts improved. (WY)",

Reported is the academic performance and cognitive attainment of 158 original study children during their first two years of school. The text of the report offers concepts and constructs related to the child's school achievement in the first and second grades, stylistic aspects of children's behavior, the child's cognitive development, cognitive behavior of mother and child, the child's language and the child's exploratory behavior and interests. A summary chapter highlights results of the followup phase. Extensive appendixes supplement the  text by providing detailed analyses of testing techniques, interview procedures, and statistical data. References are included. The final report of the preschool phase of this study is available as PS 003 334. (WY)",

        "description":"The goal of the investigation was to eliminate the disruptive, resistant and assaultive behaviors and increase the appropriate peer interaction of an economically disadvantaged kindergarten white boy. The treatment program involved presentation of adult (teacher) attention contingent upon desirable classroom behavior, withholding of attention contingent upon inappropriate behavior, and social isolation contingent upon unacceptable behavior. The subject's behavior was classified according to the Coping Analysis Schedule for Educational Settings, and the teacher's interactions with the subject were categorized according to their content. Behavior and interactions were recorded by an observer. The program was carried out daily in the activities of free play, discussion, and rest.  The subject's inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors significantly decreased when they were punished (isolation) rather than ignored. A reversal of the treatment program was introduced to demonstrate that the teacher's interactions were in fact the controlling variables. Reinstatement of data treatment had favorable results. The study indicates that the systematic use of social reinforcement techniques in the classroom can significantly change a child's behavior, even when the target is more comprehensive than the single operant.

        "description":"This report presents the results, statistical analysis and implications of classification and attention training curricula field tested with Head Start children by their teachers. Teacher, location of program, and treatment were the variables considered but only treatment effects were significant. Results, summarized in three levels, indicate (1) on some intellectual dimensions, Head Start pupils made gains regardless of the type program in which they participated, (2) specific treatments across experimental groups produced task specific gains, and (3) pupils learn operations but they do not generalize these acquired abilities to other theoretically related areas of cognitive activity. Implications are that a comprehensive Head Start program must begin with an assessment of  specific learning needs followed by the use of curricula designed to meet these needs. An approach which begins with perceptual motor manipulation, proceeds to attention training, and concludes with classification training might be more successful than any of its predecessors. See companion paper PS 003 428 which discusses the actual training inputs and document PS 003 429 which presents the research and sampling design. (WY)",

        "description":"Although this project report emphasizes 1968-1969, the fourth year of Dayton's Early Childhood Education Program (ECE), it also refers to experiences ongoing from 1965 when ECE was initiated. The 1968-1969 program was a continuation of efforts to provide concentrated and continuous learning experiences for 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children in perceptual, motivational, and social skills according to a previously developed plan. A second goal was to help parents provide a supportive home environment conducive to positive family development. The program served 2,934 economically disadvantaged children. The first part of the report explains the goals and nature of the children's pre-kindergarten classroom program and the parent program, discusses the organization and staff roles,  curriculum, and the part played by kindergarten in the ECE program. Also outlined are the activities of the social service staff and the ECE nurse, the nutrition program, and the parent program. The remainder of the document is a compilation of three separate resumes which provide detailed information on (1) psychological evaluation of ECE including tests used and data analysis, (2) a longitudinal research report of a sensorimotor skills program, and (3) NEW VISIONS--a children's art museum where young children are encouraged to explore the artifacts.

A small-scale model school system (consisting of three schools in target areas and a laboratory school) was created to serve 200 to 300 children from ages 2 through 10. The overall strategy for the program's five-year plan is (1) development of new organizational patterns and procedures (2) introduction of new techniques of instruction to and through the laboratory facility to the target area schools (3) creation of a series of preschool classes (4) development of special teacher training procedures for use in target area ungraded primary and  preschool classes. Effects of the program are to be evaluated by a series of tests given before and after each special intervention as well as by a series of intelligence and achievement tests administered over the full length of each child's involvement in EIP classes. Reports on several major research questions and on the results of EIP will be published during the next two years. (WY)",

A large and small trestle were interchanged between center and corner positions in a series of play sessions. The frequency with which the subjects used trestles in each position was recorded. Results revealed a significant difference between sessions for three of the four groups of children tested, indicating that the trestle in the center position received more usage than the trestle placed in the corner position. In addition, the large trestle placed in the center of the room received even greater usage than the small trestle in this favored position. The interaction of position and  trestle size was noted, along with the importance of studying other specifiable parameters affecting a child's use of play equipment. Results of additional research in this area could have implications for unobtrusively modifying children's play behavior patterns by the purposeful positioning of equipment. (Author/NH)",

Subjects were Negro and Mexican-American. The original study indicated that significantly higher scores were earned on tests of intellectual performance as a function of length of time in program and that \"old\" children (in program approximately 14 months) gained as many as ten IQ points over \"new\" children (in program an average of 3 months). Were the old children brighter to begin with or did they have parents more intellectually alert to the benefits of continued participation? To answer this question 57 old children and 38 new children were retested with two well-known, individually administered  intelligence tests. Results indicate that those who had been in the program an average of 23 months were to some extent brighter and that upon retesting a slight but significant drop in intellectual level occurred on the Binet. The new children, however, made slight gains between the original and the followup testing which upon closer analysis might be dismissed as artifactual. Differential effects for sex and ethnicity occurred. Five other questions about the relationship of intellectual development to day care are raised by this study and remain unanswered.

The proposed program would continue the final analysis of cross-cultural developmental studies; further develop an initial model of motivational bases of cooperative and competitive choice behavior; continue investigation of changes in strategy at various age levels and across various bargaining situations; and initiate a new program of studies on the effects of various social motives upon several learning and performance tasks among children at the second, fourth, and sixth grade levels.

A minimum of 10 weeks of paid participation as a teacher aide is available for each of the mothers. Data are reported for an 11-month period on 18 families from two centers that primarily serve Chicano migrant families. Children were pre- and posttested on measures to determine motor, language, and social  development and, in addition, a test was given to assess the stimulation potential of each child's home. Conclusions must be tentaive in the absence of a control group, but posttest scores indicated a significant improvement in the amount and quality of developmental home stimulation. Subtest scores showed the greatest improvement in the areas of language development and developmental and vocal stimulation. (NH)",

The State Department of Education, funded through a grant to Chico State College, implemented a staff development program whose chief feature was use of an itinerant teacher who spent one week in each of eight classrooms in six counties. In addition to giving practical helps in class, she taught a workshop course for which Chico granted one unit of lower division credit. The classes visited differed greatly in size, structure, ethnic composition and staff background. The teacher responded to each center's particular needs and wishes, working with both teaching and nonteaching personnel to help  them plan and evaluate daily activities, arrange schedules and room organization, use classroom and community resources more creatively, and develop techniques helpful in working more effectively with children and parents. The itinerant teacher, on an extended contract, later prepared a manual to be used in those classrooms where she had worked. Recommendations for the continuation of the program and specific suggestions for its improvement are made. (WY)",

Two Get Set classrooms in each of six areas of Philadelphia were paired for teachers, subjects, physical facilities and equipment. One classroom in each pair was enriched through the addition of materials designed to augment one or more of the following: verbal ability, performance ability, visual perception, auditory perception, and social interaction. Enrichment items included a tape recorder and tapes, a Polaroid camera with film and flashbulbs, puzzle sets, prisms, and Negro dolls and puppets. Pretest and posttest measures assessed cognitive, preceptual, and social development of the children.  The findings show that the enrichment significantly altered the classroom environment in the experimental classes. Signs of the alteration were present in the cognitive, perceptual, and social development of the experimental children. However, the control children showed greater gain scores in performance ability. Since both desirable and undesirable effects can result from environmental enrichment, the more extravagant claims for the efficacy of certain play materials should be muted and a properly equipped classroom should not be regarded as a panacea for the problems of disadvantaged children.

Instruments were developed to measure whether Head Start evolved a curriculum relevant to its goals and whether the developmental characteristics of former Head Starters are different from those of comparable first graders without Head Start experience. Methodology involved observation in classrooms, trial of specially developed materials, and administration of tests. Classroom adjustment was evaluated for pupils working with teachers, with other adults, and without direct adult supervision. Pupils in Head Start classes, former Head Starters currently in  kindergarten, and non-Head Starters used as matched controls were tested on tests of basic experience and rated for adjustment. First graders who were former Head Starters were tested on standardized intelligence and readiness tests. Even though few significant differences were found between Head Starters and non-Head Starters, this phase of the study was judged successful because instruments were developed for the description of Head Start classroom activities and for the evaluation of classroom adjustment.

Field research was undertaken in a national sample composed of 58 communities with full-year Head Start programs and seven communities with little exposure to Head Start. Intensive studies in 42 of the Head Start communities revealed that individuals and  groups associated with Head Start programs had been involved in bringing about changes in health and educational institutions. A total of 1,496 changes consistent with Head Start goals and philosophies were identified. Examples of changes are: increased involvement of the poor with institutions, greater employment of local people in paraprofessional occupations, more educational emphasis on the particular needs of the poor and minorities, and modification of health services and practices to serve the poor more effectively.

        "description":"Two major questions were raised in regard to four types of preschool programs. (1) Do programs differ in actual operation as well as descriptively? (2) Do programs have significantly different effects on children? Analysis of data obtained on samples of four classrooms in each of three programs (Bereiter-Engelmann, DARCEE, Traditional) and two classrooms in the fourth program (Montessori), showed clear differences. Despite within-program teacher differences on variables assessed by monitoring procedures (observation, television), results provide no evidence that the teachers' (N=14) characteristics were a source of difference among programs. Results also indicate that a brief four to eight week teacher training program supplemented by visits from consultants is adequate for  identifiable program implementation. The four programs did have significantly different effects on children's cognitive, social, and/or motivational development. The immediate effects of Bereiter-Engelmann and DARCEE were statistically significant in academic and motivational development. The effects of Bereiter-Engelmann were largely confined to cognitive and academic areas. The effects of DARCEE were more diffuse and most evident in the areas of motivation and attitudes. Sex differences occurred. In general, results indicate that the immediate impact was superior for the two most didactic programs. (WY)",

Subjects were 126 first and 103 second year children in matched experimental and control groups. Experimental and control groups were compared on pretests and posttests given each year of the experiment over a span of four years. Findings from the 1969-1970 phase of the experiment are reported along with the final four year findings (1967-1970). Both hypotheses were supported in part. At  prekindergarten level, gains from personalized programming were consistent enough to point out that 4-year-old children had responded well to brief daily individualized sessions of work in game-like situations which were geared to development of sensory, language, motor, or cognitive skills. The positive effects did not carry over to the end of the following year. Although the experimental program made no long-range impact on girls, the cumulative impact on boys indicated they outperformed their control counterparts as well as the girls. Some supplementary studies of achievement are reported along with unanswered questions pertaining to children who evidenced developmental lags. (WY)",

Iconic cognition which relegates verbal processes to short-term storage and output systems is inadequate to explain the verbal coding and elaboration processes suggested by some recent research findings. Moreover, verbal elaboration plus imagery has been found to be effective in promoting learning not only for college students and older children but also for kindergarten children and older preschool children. For young preschool children imaginal elaboration seems to be less effective than verbal elaboration. Experimental results themselves seem contradictory and are contradictory to Bruner who  theorizes that cognition in young children has an iconic basis rather than a verbal basis. In behavioristic models, images are conditioned sensations while in cognitive models they are dynamic and change according to formistic principles. A total of 31 postulates and 17 deductions illustrate some considerations necessary in demonstating that mnemonics data may seem inconsistent with behavioristic theories, but are consistent with a cognitive theory. Cognitivists are invited to engage in research on the problem. (WY)",

The typing booth also helps children to develop independence in problem-solving behavior and causes rapid language development. Child-control over initiation and termination of booth activities is emphasized. Language development phases reflecting typing booth achievement are described: (1) Free Exploration, (2) Search and Match, (3) Discrimination, (4) Typing Words and Stories, and (5) Classroom Related Activites. This paper reports the progress of 801 kindergarten and 300 first grade  children, mostly from low-income homes, from 9 communities, during the first year (1968-69) of the program. Tables give data on booth achievement for both groups of children, and the number of months the booths were in operation (a gross index of how long children spend in the booths). In general, differences in booth achievement from district to district, and the apparent relationship between the length of time the booth was in operation and booth achievement, reinforce the importance of booth training for children in the Responsive Follow Through Model (NH)",

Tests administered to the kindergarten classes in the fall of 1968 and again in the spring of 1969 were: short-form Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI), Caldwell Preschool Inventory (PSI), Innovative Behavior Test (IB), and Categories Test (C). The Metropolitan Readiness Test was administered in pre-post fashion to the first grade classes. The test results were used to measure changes in a child's intellectual ability as a result of one year's schooling in a Responsive Follow Through classroom. Except for four instances, average tests scores made by groups of both poor and  non-poor kindergarten Follow Through children increased for all tests in every community. That is, over the seven to nine month time period, kindergarten children in all communities increased in intelligence, the ability to form concepts, the ability to solve problems and the ability to categorize. Results for first grade children were also encouraging. There were considerable increases in Metropolitan test scores for both first grade communities from the beginning to the end of the school year. (Author/NH)",

Teachers were observed at the beginning and end of the school year and rated on a scale designed to indicate the degree to which they implemented the procedures of the Responsive Model. Findings indicated that the majority of teachers increased their teaching skills and became more consistent with the Model criteria. The Preschool Inventory (PSI) measuring achievement in skills and concepts, was administered on a pre-post basis to 761 children, and average scores in all eight  communities demonstrated growth throughout the year. Year-end scores for the Responsive Model children were at national norm levels reported for middle class children. (A limitation of the PSI is its less than adequate norms.) Changes in child test performance were greatest in classrooms with adequate physical facilities, in situations with few administrative problems and where teacher performance was consistent with Responsive Model Objectives. When measured by PSI changes, child growth was greatest for those in classes whose teachers demonstrated a high level of teaching ability. (Author/NH)",

Two groups of parents participated in separate but equivalent Parent/Child courses in a classroom setting, 2 hours a week for 10 weeks, and were taught how to teach their children through the use of educational toys. All 31 children participating were pre- and posttested on the Responsive Test, developed to measure change in the intellectual development of children who have participated in a responsive environment. A variety of skills and concepts were tested on 13 subtests of the Responsive Test. Controls allowed for the effects  of maturation and practice. For children in both groups of parents, there were significant differences on 9 of the 13 subtests. Of the other four subtests, two were at the maximum level on the pretest, and two measured factors for which the boys did not provide practice. It was concluded that the children learned a considerable amount over the 10 weeks of involvement in the Parent-Child Course and that a large portion of this learning can be attributed to the course itself.

Major objectives are: (1) to help children develop a healthy self-concept, and (2) to develop children's intellectual ability, specifically, the ability to solve problems. Another objective is to give the child an understanding of his cultural background.

Curriculums and programs for Head  Start and Follow Through classes are described. Parent participation in administrative decision-making and in the classroom is encouraged.

Participants were 25 people engaged in various disciplines (physicians, nurses, social workers, sociologists, statisticians and others) who discussed key issues on the basis of their own knowledge and experience. The two major points made were: (1) that society needs to concentrate less on the reduction of infant mortality as a goal in itself than on assuring that children who survive are whole, healthy individuals, and (2) that no matter how good the medical care system is, mortality rates cannot be lowered below a certain point unless certain changes are made in the social environment. Within this context, many issues and areas  in need of research were identified, particularly in connection with the period when the majority of deaths occur: the last eight weeks before birth and the first four weeks after birth. It was also emphasized that there is already sufficient knowledge to significantly lower the infant mortality rate in the United States if institutional change, including comprehensive care programs for the poor, could be effected.

        "description":"A study designed to test effects of cartoon characters on the behavior of preschool disadvantaged children in an educational setting explored the use of cartoons as complementary additions to work materials. Because the 83 Head Start subjects had not been introduced to the alphabet an experimental set of worksheets was made which used the 26 letters. On many of these worksheets a cat cartoon character acted out some aspect of the meaning of a word associated with a particular alphabet letter. Other worksheets used were traditional. One control and three experimental groups were formed and the following areas of cartoon-effect were measured: emotional actions, learning activity, social activity and residual attitudes. Findings indicate that the cartoon is an intrinsic stimulator  and information transmitter which would probably be more effective in elementary school classes with older children and that the cartoon should not be used for rote learning. It is suggested that the cartoon can fill a new role in the classroom, helping the teacher to reach curriculum objectives and the child to reach higher levels of learning. Appendixes include sample worksheets, pre- and posttests, a teacher questionnaire, data summary sheets, and a history of cartoon development. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"The Hartford Early Childhood Program involves more than 4,500 children from 4 years old to first grade level in over 200 classrooms. Classrooms are designed to offer children an environment that encourages them to learn independently. Ideas have been borrowed from the Montessori approach and the British Infant Schools and fitted to the needs of the Hartford school district's urban students. The program philosophy embodies new approaches that can be used in old school buildings such as formal education beginning at 3 years, mixed-age &quot;family&quot; grouping, interest centers, and emphasis on intrinsic motivation toward personel success. Future plans call for extension of the program to all public school classes in grades K through 2.

The program established has two components: the St. James Head Start Center which has three classrooms and the Day Care Home Program which operates in individual homes in housing projects. Both components provide health services, nutrition, education, social and psychological services plus opportunities for parent involvement according to Head Start goals. The St. James Center uses three models as the basis of classroom operation and instruction: the Human Development Model, the Responsive Environment Model, and the Social Reinforcement Model. Each head teacher chooses the  model she thinks will be most appropriate for her classroom. The Day Care Home Program includes 10 homes in four sites run by mothers carefully screened for the task. Personnel are encouraged to take advantage of the career ladder to advance to positions of greater responsibility within the program. Future plans include establishment of activity homes to provide before- and after-school care for school-age children and provisions for care of sick children.

Families approach the education of children 2 to 5 years as an intercultural preschool experience whose influence extends outward to the multi-ethnic neighborhood. Parents are encouraged to participate, interacting with the staff and each other during formal and informal sessions. The project staff offer a course on working with young children to interested mothers. Positive contributions stemming from this project are that the children involved seem to be developing without racial or class prejudice and the parents are more open-minded in accepting members of other socioeconomic and racial groups as friends.

Twenty-four lower socioeconomic status mothers and their 2-year-olds were placed in the following three groups: (1) language treatment, (2) counseling and day care treatment, and (3) control with no treatment. Hypotheses were tested which concerned language styles and mother-child interaction patterns. Experimental language group children and mothers received treatment (verbal reinforcement, elaboration and extension) for 1 1/2 hours, 2 days a week for 10 weeks. Mothers in the counseling group received counseling on matters  of concern to low income black mothers for 3 hours daily, once a week for 10 weeks. Their children were in day care for that period of time. Pre- and posttests of mothers and children in the two experimental groups were made using a syntax measure and the children were tested on concept development. Controls were posttested only. It was concluded that the structured language program (a) produced a significant change in the syntax style of mothers and the pattern of verbal interaction between mothers and children, and (b) effectively changed the syntax style of the children.

        "description":"As a final report on alienation and achievement among 753 Oglala Sioux secondary school students on the Pine Ridge Reservation, this document attempts to portray the circumstances affecting the Indian child in school. To provide a basis for comparison, the sample also contained 855 white secondary school pupils. General findings which are believed to contribute to the Indian child's severe cultural disruption are that alienation increases as intelligence and achievement decline; that alienation tends to be significantly greater among those who do not continue their education than among those who continue attending school; that as degree of Indian blood increases, intelligence and achievement measures decline; and that as Indian children progress through school, alienation scores  tend to be reduced and IQ increased. It is also noted that teacher role is believed to play a significant part in academic success of the Indian student. It is concluded (1) that factors of political and economic realities in which Indian students exist override immediate local influences and (2) that any thoroughgoing program must deal with the fact that poor performance or failure to complete schooling is very much a function of alienation on the part of the child in a conflicted community where middle-class values clash with residues of the Indian cultural heritage.

The student population was divided into 3 roughly equivalent groups by language category, and group characteristics were examined. Indian students numbering 689 responded to a survey eliciting information and attitudes concerning student characteristics, religious preference, friendship patterns, vocational preferences, attitude toward the Institute, and future plans. Indian students included in the study were from more than 70 different tribes with 70% being members of 15 predominantly Southwestern tribes. Although the 3 groups  were similar in most respects, it was concluded that Indian students at Haskell Institute were a select population in that they already had experienced educational success and were sufficiently motivated to seek post high school training and education. It was felt that these factors were strong enough to neutralize many differences that might be found between Indian youth in general in each of the 3 language categories. The major portion of this document consists of survey instruments utilized and resultant statistical data. (EL)",

A further purpose was to determine the attitudes of students, teachers, administrators, and community members toward the use of the MOE unit in the training of office-practice concepts. Although results did not indicate that achievement was increased by the use of the MOE unit, it was concluded that the lack of pre-test results and the opinions of full-time  students, community members, faculty, and administrators would justify further use and evaluation of the MOE unit as an instructional aid in the teaching of clerical skills to high school students.

        "description":"Michigan is widely recognized as a traditional leader in outdoor recreation and tourism. Its location and resources provide many comparative advantages toward attracting visitors. State spending for outdoor recreation amounted to $95 million over the decade ending in 1960. State and Federal policies and programs are likely to emphasize outdoor recreation and tourism much more than in the past. Of the factors affecting the future of this industry, population of the prime market area may well be the most important. The future population mix will heavily emphasize the demand patterns of the very young and the old. Technological and cultural changes will broaden the range of choice in leisure activities. The greatest shifts in land use are likely to be in areas relatively accessible  to metropolitan population centers. The public sector can most strongly influence emerging patterns of development in 2 major ways: indirectly through public regulation of activities, such as careful zoning; and directly via public development of scenic roads, parks, and regional interpretive complexes. Imaginative programs appear crucial if Michigan is to maintain or expand its share of Upper Great Lakes tourism and outdoor recreation in the face of growing competition.

By coordinating its activities with numerous community organizations, CCAA has been able to provide adult basic education directly to the farm worker. Spanish language radio and television stations have been used extensively to advertise CCAA's educational program. Bilingual  counselors and teacher aides have gone into migrant camps, barrios, and colonias to knock on doors and hold community meetings, explaining the program and signing up potential participants.

Some 124 Indians were interviewed, many of whom were leaders and participants in various Red Power organizations. As noted, the dominant impression to emerge from the research was that Indians have become very aware that they, collectively, can materially transfigure their own lives for the better. They have also become aware that other racial and ethnic groups have culturally expressive institutions. Indians have been lacking detectable political power and have been unable to control education of their own children; consequently , they have gravitated to the brink of cultural  extinction. It is reported that the recent vigilance of the Indian springs from a disconcerting realization that he must now mobilize every vestige of power to provide for this cultural continuity. The document concludes that Red Power and educational renaissance are both requisite to the regeneration of Indian culture. (EL)",

The study described in this report was undertaken in order to examine the social and economic consequences of population decline within the Northeast. It was hypothesized that among rural areas losing population the socioeconomic characteristics of the population would vary inversely with the extent to which out-migration was balanced by an  excessive of births over deaths. Seventy-six rural counties were divided into 4 groups on the basis of their ratios of total population loss to migration loss. The 4 groups were then compared in terms of their average standing with respect to several demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results indicated (1) that there is little, if any, systematic variation among the county groupings with respect to the demographic characteristics of their population with the exception of age, and (2) that the socioeconomic characteristics of the population vary inversely with the extent to which out-migration is balanced by natural increase.

        "description":"In this paper, presented at the 1965 Annual Conference on the Education of Spanish-Speaking Children and Youth, the author discussed the moral issue of social and economic injustice as related to Mexican Americans. He pointed out the inequities of unemployment, poverty, and education which are part of the background of the problems facing the Mexican American child. Participants in the conference were reminded of the fact that other conferences on Mexican Americans had failed because discussions of problems fell on deaf ears or because of failure to initiate or implement the recommendations which were made. In summarizing, the author cited the need for (1) sincere efforts to understand the culturally different child, (2) recognition of his talents and problems, (3) reinforcement  of his self-confidence, (4) appropriate educational and guidance programs, (5) appropriate teacher preparatory schools and in-service workshops, (6) equal social and economic opportunities, and (7) cooperation of all segments of society.

The study, which was limited to the village milieu of Northwest Alaska Eskimo communities, points out that a type of quasi-urban acculturation is brought about by the natives' increased expectations for Western material goods in conjunction with their problems arising from limited possibilities for achieving these expectations and in part from pressures found in shifting their value system. The study is divided into 2 major sections: (1) analysis of life in several small communities representative of the range of acculturative experiences in villages and (2) description and analysis of life in Nome, a large village. The  impinging social forces from the outside and the natives' changing subsistent enconomy are discussed, as are Christianity and alcoholism in the socialization process of the natives. In conclusion, it is noted that the migration is creating the usual problems of employment, racial discrimination, and poor social adjustment which intensifies cultural shock for the natives. (EL)",

It is noted that today's youth are denied opportunities for meaningful physical work experiences in the home, community, and school. Reasons for lack of opportunities include overcrowded residential areas, lack of land areas, schools ignoring their charge to provide learning opportunities, and lack of worthy use of leisure time. It is believed that not enough concrete learning experiences in educational institutions are provided; thus, guidelines are given for implementing school gardens, school farms, orchards, and berry patches. Other related facilities and programs suggested include restoration of a saw mill, gristmill, general store, community church, post office, pioneer museum, or blacksmith  shop. Some special events suggested are apple-butter making, cornhusking bees, maple-syrup making, quilting bees, candle making, soap making, butter making, ice-cream making, and dye making. It is believed that a far-sighted school district will provide for multiple use of farm and garden facilities and related programs to reach a wide variety of participants (including preschool children and the handicapped). Significant values of farm and garden programs are listed, and curriculum development activities are surveyed. (EL)",

The questionnaire sent to 490 graduates (261 from the 8 high-ranking counties; 229 from the 8 low-ranking counties) was designed to cover mental ability, social expectation, individual motivation, financial ability, and propinquity. In addition, an index was used to measure status of a youth among his peers. Some results of the study indicated that (1) more seniors from high-ranking counties planned to continue their  education; (2) the percentage of boys and girls who planned to go to college was about the same; (3) most seniors' fathers were farmers and the mothers were housewives, with more mothers in the high-ranking counties having other occupations; and (4) mothers in both county groups were better educated than fathers.

The commission has been urged to present recruiting literature, sample test material, and examination announcements in Spanish. This study investigated the effects of presenting verbal test material in an English-Spanish format to 307 postal clerk-carrier applicants in San Antonio, Texas. Sixty-two percent of the applicants indicated that they spoke Spanish at home or at work at least 25% of the time. Seventy-seven percent were high school graduates or had an equivalent education. The study indicated that, for persons educated in U.S. high schools, competence in written English is very likely to exceed or at least equal competence in written  Spanish. The conclusions drawn from the investigation were (1) that providing bilingual test material for such groups is of little help and (2) that, in a few individual cases where the educational level is low and the commitment to Spanish is high, there is some improvement over an initially poor score.

The essay \"Indian and Other Tribes\"  presents the Indian viewpoint regarding the integrationist's theory of the melting pot as being applied to the Indian without regard to existing rights of tribes as sovereign communities. \"Patterns of American Prejudice\" is a report on a major study of contemporary anti-Semitism in the United States. The final essay, \"Thoughts on the Dominant American,\" discusses the social science and literature of America being redundantly concerned with the fates and fortunes of the minorities while the social consciousness of the dominant American needs to be reassessed.

The purpose of this paper is to report the findings of this study regarding the influences of age, sex, and minority status in school upon the self-concept of the various Indian groups studied. A comparison was made between Indian and non-Indian groups in an effort to answer questions on the uniqueness of the Indian groups within the larger society. The self-esteem and self-concept data from the study indicate that the great majority of Indian youth see  themselves as fairly competent persons within their own social world but can be expected to show doubts about themselves in the non-Indian world. The study also concluded that the context within which an individual judges himself is critical to attaching meaning to his so-called \"self-esteem\" ratings and that self-concept must be studied more extensively before it is understood.

Also listed are areas which reflect a need for more national coordination: (1) expansion of programs to include nonmigrant unemployed agricultural and seasonal workers; (2) more ways to interest and involve adult migrants in education; (3)  bilingual, bicultural tests and curriculum materials drawn from the migrant life experience; (4) a new formula for computing the number of eligible students to be served by a state; (5) improvement in migrant home life--sanitation, nutrition, etc.; (6) stronger child labor laws to keep children from the fields; (7) more funds for preschool children, from birth to age 3; (8) better interstate coordination, exchange of teachers and techniques; and (9) more consideration for the strong possibility that many of the children may not grow up to be migrants, if for no other reason than the lack of demand for farm labor.

It was noted that the performances of Eskimos on measures of these cognitive abilities approximate and in some instances exceed norms for the United States. It was also noted that, in some cases, Eskimo students have surpassed urban Caucasian students in ability to recall complex structured images. The study pointed to the early explorers of Alaska who recognized the skill and ability of Eskimos to analyze spatial relationships or to recall complex patterns through structured mental images. Studies cited in the document substantiate that these unusual talents  are possessed by the Natives of Alaska. It is believed that these cognitive strengths should enable the Natives to make significant contributions in areas such as map-making, spelling, or mechanics. With advanced training, Native talents could apply in other fields. (EL)",

It was assumed that village teachers often did not send student records which would have provided a basis for placing students in appropriate academic programs. It was believed that, without past achievement records, native students were often placed in lower-achievement-level classes. The group tested in the study consisted of 68 native ninth graders of Eskimo, Aleut, and Athabascan origin. It was thought that many of the rural native students were capable of more advanced academic work, according to their achievement test profile analysis, upon entering the ninth grade. It was concluded that the students achieved  high scores on a relatively less culturally biased abstract reasoning test and that these students had the potential to do well in academic work. It was suggested that teachers should take more care to base their expectations on the capabilities of individual rural native students and not on stereotypes about the group as a whole.

The samples consisted of 39 secondary students enrolled in a tutorial reading clinic and 17 repeating first-grade students from a public school. Eye-movement recordings (three and four, respectively) were administered with standardized reading selections. The five variables considered were fixations per 100 words, regressions per 100 words, duration of fixation, span of recognition, and reading rate. From an analysis of the data, it was determined that changes in eye graphs for fixations, regressions, and rate did occur as a result of training in reading; that consistent patterns of change occurred for  fixations, regressions, and rate; and that the pattern of correlations of eye graph data and standardized test scores was consistent, although the correlations were too low to be considered predictive. The basic deficiencies in this study were the number of eye graphs administered and the lack of standardized test data for comparison. Studies in progress will include data from a minimum of five graphs and both pretest and post-test standardized test results. Tables are included. (Author/DH)",

One group was taught to discriminate between four artificial graphemes by identifying them with different geometric forms. The second group was taught to give the graphemes the letter names \"S,\"\"M,\"\"E,\" and \"A.\" Two control groups were used, one with the related task of learning the names for animal pictures. All four groups were tested, and the mean number of times it took each subject to complete a perfect trial of saying four words made up from the graphemes was recorded. The compared results indicated no significant differences between the performances of the groups and did not support the results of many  correlational studies. When the experiment was repeated 1 year later lumping the control groups, the results were again insignificant. It was concluded that a 1967 study presenting the same four graphemes with left-right reading, phonic blend, and letter-sound training indicated a more meaningful correlation between letter-sound identification and reading ability acquisition; it was suggested that the social-economic status of a child may explain the meaningful relationship found between letter-name knowledge and reading ability acquisition in other studies.

For purposes of this study, a grapheme was defined as the minimum unit of orthography to which a segmental phoneme, a unitary phoneme combination, or a nonphoneme would be associated. An informational processing model for automatic reading was then constructed. A conditional association matrix, with 65 rows for grapheme signals and 45 columns for phoneme designates, was hypothesized as an adequate structure to accommodate all of the English grapheme-phoneme associations. Two phases of the association matrix were described: a dynamic learning phase and a skilled state or processing phase. The acquisition of reading skills was simulated by attempting to write a computer program for  each grade level in a basic reading series. Programs were written for the preprimer and primer of the Lippincott series. These programs achieved 96 percent accuracy in processing the 190 words in the preprimer and 85 percent accuracy in processing the 770 words in the primer. The types of errors are discussed. The associations and rules for processing the grade-1 readers in the series have also been written. The results of the research demonstrate the feasibility of automated reading.

Two advantages of the method are (1) more effective grouping of basic addition facts, and systematic and consistent use of reasoning in their derivation, and (2) use of a special classroom technique to improve the proficiency of a child in the application of basic arithmetic facts. An analysis is presented to show how the organization of various methods for teaching addition came into use, and compares their advantages and disadvantages. (RP)",

Tests developed were a series of 35mm color slides which illustrated laboratory situations involving basic science processes. The slides were synchronized with a tape recording to provide instructions for the children. Each pupil indicated his answer to each question by marking his answer sheet as directed from the tape recording. Six samples of the Basic Science Process Tests (BSPT) were developed. Each BSPT item was validated by a critique jury. Data were collected on 854 pupils in grades 1, 2, and 3, half of whom had studied the 1967 edition of &quot;Science - A Process Approach&quot; for one year. Evidence from this  study indicates that the test format used can be made to function effectively as a group test for primary grade children.

        "description":"Reported is research involving the development and testing of a program designed to encourage individual creative mathematical activity in first grade students. Initially, some characteristics of the creative process and creative thinking were examined and six criteria describing certain aspects of mathematical creativity were identified and validated. An instrument used to measure observable mathematical creativity was designed in order to test the program on mathematical creativity. Two hypotheses were formulated: H1: \"Participation in the program will increase a student's observable mathematical creativity\"; H2: \"Participation in the program will not affect a student's performance on a test of general creative ability\". Part III contains the appendices of this report.  (FL)",

Changes on the part of the students which are clearly specified before instruction and which are the explicit objectives of the instruction are described as intentional. Insightful refers to the student's acceptance of responsibility in self-directing or pacing of the learning task which implies that the student accepts the learning tasks and has the responsibility for pacing his own activities within that learning task. In designing a self-paced teacher education program, the designers found the following four steps to be essential: (1) Instructional materials had to be systematically designed  with explicit behavioral goals and a specific relationship between each of the objectives and the instructional activities; (2) The objectives for the first set of instructional modules were listed on separate cards and sequenced in what appears to be a logical hierarchy; (3) A self-diagnostic test was essential so that each student could identify those tasks that he could do on entering the program; (4) Knowing what he could already do was important to the student because it revealed what he could not do.

An underlying purpose of this module is to emphasize the importance of instructional experiences for students being directed toward intentional, observable behavior change.

Because of the diagnostic data available in the pre-appraisal experience, it is possible to determine which instructional sequence appears to be most appropriate for which student.

Frequently, activities are suggested that correlate with other subjects, such as science, language arts, social studies, mathematics, and physical education. In a few units, ways of evaluation are also suggested. The writers of this publication suggest that whenever possible, cooperative projects and demonstrations should be arranged  with the school food service supervisor to be carried out in the school dining room or school food service preparation center.

After pretesting, students at each grade level at each school were divided by random assignment into experimental and control groups. The experimental groups received instruction based on learning hierarchies which incorporated ideas of Gagne; the control groups received  instruction not related to hierarchies. All children were posttested with instruments used as the pretest. It was found that ability to perform the volume tasks at fourth-grade level may be related to experience in &quot;Science - A Process Approach&quot;. A similar relationship with sixth-grade students was not found. A positive correlation was found between mental age and performance on the Test on Formal Operations.

This may be due to the teacher's lack of understanding of the world of children, of their capacities and capabilities. One way for a prospective teacher to learn and understand a child's view of the world is to have conversations with children. The author has therefore designed a field experience program built around individual interviews with children. Students first read Piaget's \"The Child's Conception of the World.\" They learn why interviews are used, how to ask questions, and what they can find out from the discussions. The prospective teachers who participated in  this program have begun to develop an understanding of the world of children and skills needed to continue to increase their understanding. (BR)",

The teachers' educational experiences were gained through activities in a two-week workshop, then followed by six five-week, three-hour weekly sessions, alternatively scheduled for mathematics and science. During the two-week preparation period teachers studied and practiced inquiry learning  episodes, defined behaviors that pupils could achieve, gained understanding of the psychology of instruction necessary for process and conceptual learning, defined the specific roles of teachers and pupils, and considered the nature of desirable facilities for investigative laboratory learning. Administrators of the six school districts involved in this program arranged for release time for resource teachers. Evaluation of the program indicates that changes in teacher behavior and role in guiding learning was achieved. (BR)",

Some verbal rewards are tasks rewards, other rewards are more personal; and still other verbal rewards are impersonal. Verbal rewards, therefore, have both intellectual and emotional implications. Research literature indicates that &quot;verbal reward&quot; constitutes a significant portion of what the teacher does in the classroom. Relative to the teaching of science, researchers have found that teachers in primary grade classrooms follow typical patterns of reward giving while using the new science programs. They strive to function as sources of information and incentive despite the nature of the curriculum. Teachers give the same ratio of positive evaluations (rewards) to negative evaluations: four  positive evaluations for every negative evaluation to students who are correct and to students who are incorrect. In a study undertaken by the author it was found that SCIS experienced students worked more slowly under reward than under the no reward condition while non-SCIS experience students worked more quickly under reward.

Data were treated by analysis of covariance using as covariables scores on the School and College Ability Test, Sequential Test of Educational Progress in Reading and Science, and a biology pretest developed for the project. Sex was also treated as an independent variable in some analyses. The results provided  no evidence for the superiority of one method over the other, nor was there any evidence of a general improvement in biology instruction.

The training procedures were found effective in training the student tutors to use the 10 specified tutoring techniques; their overall mastery was 89.6 percent.

In each of four teach-reteach sequences, a specific teaching behavior is selected for emphasis in the supervisory conference. The first two sequences are reported here: orienting students to the learning task and reinforcing student responses. Subjects were interns in a master of arts in teaching program. Three teams of two interns and the supervisor comprised the experimental group; five interns, each working individually with the supervisor, the control group. The same five-step conference format was followed by both groups: orientation to the conference,  provision of feedback, selection of a focus, provision of discrimination training, and provision of closure. Performance criteria were developed and used to code microteaching videotapes to obtain change scores between teach and reteach sessions. The hypothesis was tested using the Mann Whitney U statistical test. Colleague-supervised interns performed a significantly greater number of specific teaching behaviors in the first sequence. In the second they performed significantly better on three of eight verbal and three of ten nonverbal reinforcing behaviors.

This concept is called &quot;teacher specificity.&quot; Single linear regression analysis and a 3-equation system with simultaneous estimation were applied to data from the EOS sixth grade questionnaire, teacher questionnaire, and principal questionnaire to develop a correlation between school resources and variations in students' raw test scores for two populations--white students and black students. The difference in correlation coefficients for the two populations is the basis for the idea that these resources have different value &quot;resourceness&quot; for  whites and blacks. Extension of this idea suggests that teacher evaluation might be based on the specific situation rather than a general set of standards. Greater local control, specifically by school principals, would be a method of implementing this type of evaluation.

There are three major incompetencies of theory: failure of scope, the vice of abstraction, and radical plurality. A renascence of the field of curriculum will occur only if curriculum energies are diverted from theoretic pursuits to three other modes of operation: the practical, the quasi-practical, and the eclectic. The practical mode differs from the theoretic in many aspects: Its end or outcome is a decision, a selection and guide to possible action. Its subject matter is always something taken as  concrete and particular and treated as indefinitely susceptible to circumstance and highly liable to unexpected change. Its problems arise from states of affairs in relation to ourselves. Its method, \"deliberation,\" is not linear but complex, fluid, transactional aimed at identification of the desirable and at either attainment of the desired or alteration of desires. The quasi-practical is an extension of the practical methods and purposes to subject matters of increasing internal variety. The eclectic recognizes the usefulness of theory to curriculum decision, takes account of certain weaknesses of theory as ground for decision, and provides some degree of repair of these weaknesses.

Three indices were developed for analyzing teacher migration and attrition (dependent variables) at the statewide level and in the Detroit metropolitan region. Most of the 14 independent variables were characteristics of local school districts. A variety of multivariate techniques were employed in analyzing data. Predictors found to be of explanatory and predictive  importance were used as the basis for aggregating transition matrices showing actual migration and attrition flows. Results showed extensive turnover losses attributable to migration and attrition. Teacher movement was heaviest within rather than between the metropolitan and state cells. Economic correlates assume an important role in supply with demographic factors of limited value.

Rather than being assigned to individual teachers in a laboratory school, students are organized into cells for exposure to selected professionally oriented experiences in different types of schools. Each cell consists of about 20 students, a faculty member from the area of secondary education who serves as coordinator, five secondary school teachers from the laboratory school and teachers from other cooperating schools. The program is divided into cycles which include preparation, field experience, and follow-up sessions. Evaluation indicates that program participants profited considerably in development of their perceptions  about students, teachers, classrooms, methods, and themselves and were able to apply these perceptions in the student teaching which followed. A followup study for further evaluation has been designed. Significant aspects of the program are being incorporated into the regular secondary school teacher preparation program.

The Office of Overseas Schools provides facilitating funding; participating schools abroad give on-site assistance; the University provides financial, personnel, and facility resources and is the administering, planning, and coordinating agent. Four experimental components comprise the program: (1) provision of multi-cultural environment for affective learning; (2) conduct of formal instruction to  improve professional competencies; (3) inservice and specialized experience for instructional, curricular, and administrative improvements; (4) conduct of research and experimentation to provide information and practicum experiences. The learning experiences require reciprocal activities and interinvolvement of target populations. The program enhances teacher training and serves as a laboratory and model for further development of innovative programs, cooperation in teacher preparation, and expansion of the behaviors which professional preparation in the field of education affects.

Based on the \"summaries approach\" to innovativeness (an approach the author views as indispensible to the development of empirical studies with a radically different focus than those now available), the outline is designed to enable the systematic comparison of existing theories and findings and to indicate more clearly the areas in which intensive research is needed. In presenting and illustrating the proposed research strategy, the author (1) offers a general context for  innovation by outlining basic components of the social organization and its environment; (2) defines organizational innovation (particularly as it is distinct from other change phenomena); (3) distinguishes stages and dimensions of the process and other descriptive characteristics; (4) examines selected attributes of the contextual components as potential universal determinants of innovativeness (in this case, innovative frequency) and the empirical evidence related to each; and (5) envisages future developments in the field.

To take place before student teaching, it provides for 2 days per week to be spent at one of 12 local cooperating elementary schools, studying teaching methods in specific academic areas in the school setting under a Temple University professor and then practicing these methods in the classroom. Students are admitted to the program on a voluntary basis, with a choice being offered between the conventional campus-based courses or the EPICT school-centered courses. Advantages of the program in the eyes of the involved Temple faculty are that it is more realistic, provides a source of immediate feedback for the  instructor, permits opportunity to work firsthand with children, and is a natural setting for investigation and research. Evaluation of the program by students, faculty members, and school principals later using EPICT students as student teachers indicates that it has been successful in helping education students adjust to urban teaching.

Each of four teachers (science, math, social studies, language arts) were observed with each section during 10 complete class sessions, five during the first and five during the last month of the semester. Data was entered onto a 10 x 10 matrix and interpretive techniques suggested by Flanders and by Soar were tested against results of the pupil affect as measured by a questionnaire administered at the end of the semester. Significant differences between teachers were obtained on Flanders'  revised i/d ratio, on Soar's flexibility count, on the 7-7 (extended teacher criticism) and the 7-9 (teacher criticism followed by student initiation) cell frequencies, and on a number of other analytic combinations. The i/d ratio did not correlate with pupil affect as would be predicted--the highest i/d classroom did not have the most favorable affect nor the lowest the poorest affect. The flexibility count was most likely affected by achievement level of classroom in its relation to the emotional climate. Low achievers preferred low flexible interactions; high achievers seemed less affected by teacher flexibility. Combined 7-7 and 7-9 counts seems to be correlated with affect. (JS)",

It was hypothesized that (1) it should be possible to select the best predictors of acceptance of innovations from among the set of attribute variables and (2) attributes will tend to cluster and allow for categorization under specific factor headings. Subjects were 337 teachers (K-13) in five large urban systems. Information concerning perceived attitudes toward 18 different innovations (related to the teaching-learning process and school organization) were collected using a five-point Likert-type rating scale consisting of 16 attribute items representing the independent variables and two dependent  variables (acceptance and experience). Principal component analysis and a multiple regression program were utilized to derive the best predictors. Hypothesis 1 was accepted; Hypothesis 2 was generally supported. Conclusions: Attributes accruing to innovations are perhaps as relevant to implementation of innovations as are external factors-how a teacher perceives a new idea or thing being as important as the thing or idea itself. Innovation appears initially to be a mental process followed by a physical act of implementation. Implications are noted for change theory, for practice, and for research. (JS)",

After each class, the GTA viewed the tape, selected short segments illustrating classroom events of interest to him, and met regularly with five other GTA's and a training leader (acting as a resource person) to view and discuss the instructional problems in the selected videotape segments. Two other feedback methods were available to the GTA:  Post Class Questionnaires from students and videotaped Student Debriefings during which four or five of his students discussed class videotapes with a member of the training staff. GTA's generally endorsed the program ranking skill improvement above information acquisition or attitude change. Four key principles characterize the procedures ultimately developed: (1) Exercise the classroom system as a whole; (2) Structure a learning environment in which participants can generate their own goals and determine their own conditions of practice; (3) Maximize objective feedback; (4) Provide the opportunity to analyze feedback in a nonthreatening group setting.

Informal evaluation through student opinionaires indicates that the program eliminates the common complaint of great disparity between educational theory and classroom practice. (RT)",

Background knowledge concerning the family, the child, and the community gives the student teachers an understanding of the sources of problems encountered in inner-city classrooms. Resource people from the community and public schools bring expertise in urban sociology; poverty; the culture of black, Indian, and Mexican Americans; communication and how it is affected by cultural differences; classroom techniques relevant to the inner-city classroom--creative drama, role-playing and the use of multi-ethnic materials. Special attention is given to the techniques of teaching the basic skills and classroom management. Integral parts of the program are: (1)  the careful screening of student candidates and cooperating teacher, (2) the joint school-university appointment of inner-city classroom teachers to coordinate the program and supervise the students, and (3) the development of an advisory committee, made up of representatives from both institutions, to assist in planning, evaluating, and recommending improvements in the program. Among the values have been that the number of students per quarter has increased from an average of 17 in 1964 to an average of 60 in 1969, that approximately two thirds of the student participants have chosen to remain as inner-city teachers, and that 11 groups involved have offered positive and supportive cooperation.

Three groups of elementary education majors were involved in the experiment, the immediate objective of which was to test the effectiveness of two different forms of the Classroom Simulation Test--a test based on motion picture sequences of classroom problems and students' responses to these. The control group interviews were conducted without any supporting test data. In both experimental groups a form of the Classroom Simulation Test (objective form in one group, projective form in the other) was  used along with two other psychological tests (Edwards Personal Preference Schedule and the 16 Personality Factors test). The effectiveness of the interviews in promoting behavioral change was determined by judges' ratings of video tape recordings of each student's subsequent classroom performance. Results support earlier findings as to the effectiveness of the testing-interviewing technique and indicate: (1) There is a distinct advantage to using supporting test data in the interviews as contrasted with interviewing without the use of test data. (2) It may not matter which form of the Classroom Simulation Test (objective or projective) is used. (3) Learning effects are not limited to a single instructor personality. (JES)",

These behaviors include the ability to understand and write phonetic transcriptions of dialect speech, to prepare a list of nonstandard features found in these dialects, to prepare an individual curriculum for each child based on his type of nonstandard speech, and to select and organize commercially available materials on specific features of usage for the needs  of individual students. Final results on whether the teacher trained with these materials can achieve the desired behaviors are expected in summer 1970.

Nonverbal language, a reflection of both cultural and individual differences, includes not only the teacher's facial expressions, postures, gestures, etc., but also the way in which he manages the learning environment--desk arrangement, movement and position in the classroom, allocation of time, and tactics for controlling student behavior. Various classroom observation techniques have been developed to analyze teacher behaviors on a continuum ranging from encouraging to inhibiting communication and to enable teachers to understand and improve their nonverbal behavior  and influence. The most important sources of improvement lie, however, in the teacher's continuing openness to, and awareness of, the occurrence and significance of nonverbal events and expressions, i.e., in his \"ability and willingness to understand how he has been understood.\" (Included with this monograph are a variety of outlines and anecdotal illustrations and a 17-item bibliography.)

It favors the concept of career ladders for paraprofessionals which could possibly lead to a professional career, but rejects the idea of merit-pay for teachers. The author states that the American Federation of Teachers should take a positive role in developing new concepts of teacher roles and new teacher evaluation criteria. It can do this by establishing a long-range program of basic concepts for collective bargaining, working  with state education departments in the field of teacher certification, and establishing its own programs of inservice teacher education. This can be done best on a local level.

Results showed that the control group's test scores remained the same or decreased slightly, while the experimental group's scores increased five to 20 percentile points. The greatest increase was shown by secondary school teachers of academic subjects. It may possibly be inferred that the T-Group training caused the increase in scores, but further research must be done to determine whether this training causes any actual changes in the teacher's  classroom behavior. One approach would be pre- and posttesting of student attitudes to the teacher undergoing T-Group sensitivity training. (Four pages of teacher comments on the T-Group experience are appended.) (RT)",

        "description":"The objective of this study was to show how classroom observation systems measuring different dimensions of student behavior might be used simultaneously to record and analyze classroom process variables used by teachers. The subjects of the study were 71 student teachers, and the four observational systems were the Reciprocal Category System, the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior, the Teacher Practices Observation Record, and the Taxonomy of Imagery Provocation. The findings from the four sets of data studied showed that those specific elements of verbal and cognitive behavior which have been identified exist in a state of dynamic interaction. These variables are usually lifted out of their dynamic context and treated as static entities, but the multidimensional approaches  can significantly broaden observational perception.

The 605 participants include teachers, librarians, administrators, and central office personnel. Nine aspects of the four training sessions are discussed with respect to the three major headings of \"organization,\"\"training procedure,\" and \"observer competence.\" Under the category of organization, training time, group size, and training sequence are considered. A training time of two days is developed, while a comparison of results by group size indicates that large groups are as effective as small groups. Training procedural concerns include development of a  manual, revised twice; content, which shifts in emphasis from concepts and theory to skills and calculations; and trainer use. Observer competence elements include types of instruments--a concept test and a skill test--and the improvement made in these two instruments. The paper concludes that it has been found possible to train large groups of observers in two days to a responsible level of accuracy in the use of the Reciprocal Category System for classroom observation for purposes of classroom self-analysis.

Standards for resources and facilities tend to be based primarily on the experience and judgment of the committee. Three proposals for research are (1) experimental studies of limited but related problems which would ultimately provide data for broader theorizing; (2) an information bank recording a student's biographical data, in-training experience and evaluation by superiors, and follow-up data on success or failure in teaching (if operated by a central agency such as AACTE and with enough  institutions participating, this could provide a valuable means of testing hypotheses); (3) a crash program in the form of a large-scale questionnaire patterned after the Equal Opportunities Survey and using two sources--program characteristics from every sizable training institution, and data from first- and second-year teachers on their training and teaching success. This would give evidence of the validity of the proposed standards and also suggest research studies and program innovation. (MBM)",

        "description":"Patterns of teacher and student verbal behavior within a framework of reinforcement theory were analyzed through the use of a modified form of the Observation Schedule and Record 4V (OScAR). The study examined the extent to which the rewarding teacher's classroom discourse served as a model for the verbal style of a student among his peers. Data were initially collected from 30 groups; 10 preschool, 10 kindergarten, and 10 first grade classrooms. From each of these levels, six classes showing the highest frequency of teacher reinforcing verbal behavior were selected, and designated as the \"rewarding teacher\" group. Four pupils (two boys, two girls) were chosen at random from each class to form the final sample (N=72). The verbal statements of these pupils were scored using five  scales of imitative behavior developed from the OScAR protocols. The data were analyzed using a 2 x 3 factoral design (sex x grade levels). Female pupils imitated significantly more than males on four of the five verbal categories. In three of the analyses grade level differences were located, and for only one analysis was there a significant interaction. Three findings are of importance in demonstrating the potential of the OScAR technique for measuring constructs such as imitation and for measuring pupil as well as teacher behavior.

Students schedule lectures or discussions by request, and behavioral objectives have been written to embrace all of the teaching concepts and skills required for initial certification. These objectives have been subsumed under the categories of \"design\" and \"interaction.\" Design skills include writing and using behavioral objectives, task analysis, and designing instructional units; interaction skills include individual counseling, interaction analysis, and effective use of questions. The primary vehicle for practicing these skills is the student team teaching experience. Evaluation of the program has been accomplished by soliciting reactions from  I-STEP participants and cooperating teachers and also from preservice and public school students who were taught by I-STEP student teacher teams. Response to the program was mostly favorable, and evaluation of the student teachers indicates that team teaching is as good as or better than solo teaching in terms of experience for the student teachers and effectiveness for the students.

        "description":"A study of the relationship between teacher knowledge and teaching style was made in an eastern metropolitan area, with 53 first-year intern teachers in secondary schools whose answers in the Common Examination of the National Teacher Examination were available for analysis. Each teacher was visited in the classroom on four occasions by two observers, one trained in the Flanders system of Interaction Analysis and the other in the OScAR 4V system. The resulting observations and the 345 multiple-choice examination items were analyzed and evaluated, and the results are set out in four tables. Although the findings are tentative, they indicate a correlation between lecturing behavior and performance in the NTE examination, with science-oriented teachers lecturing more and listening  less, while those with high scores in literature and the history and philosophy of education and teaching practices favor a dialog approach. The study suggests a close connection between the teacher's knowledge of teaching principles and practices and teaching style and, if based on larger numbers, could probably have provided additional data on the dynamics and etiology of teaching styles.

The second area is an understanding of the various levels of meaning in a work, from the simplest level of plot, to the devices and techniques employed to express tone, symbolic meaning and theme. Finally, a familiarity with form and genre--specifically, an appreciation of how the artist selects and structures the events  and ideas he wishes to convey--is essential for increasing the students' analytical literary expertise.

Results indicated that (1) effective writers had parents with more formal education and lived in homes of higher socioeconomic status that ineffective writers; (2) effective writers were more  likely to be female, younger, college-oriented, widely-read, and willing to write about their personalities and self-concepts than were ineffective writers; (3) effective writers engaged in music activities and favored academic courses while ineffective writers preferred vocational courses and liked English class least of all; (4) effective writers owned more books, wrote more for personal pleasure, and disliked grammar study more than ineffective writers; (5) writing effectiveness correlated with scholastic aptitude and academic status.

The phonological level of consistent sound-to-letter relationships can be further examined in terms of the components of position, stress, and environmental factors; and the morphological level can be subdivided into components of compounding, affixation, and word families. These new insights into the nature of American-English orthography, provided by statistical analysis, modern computer  technology, and field work in linguistics, should make a profound difference in a linguistically oriented spelling program, both in what is learned and in how that learning is accomplished.

A study of the precision and demands of the best modern novelists (Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, Faulkner, and Hemingway) can broaden the literary response of students overexposed to the classical styles of the early 17th and 18th centuries (Browne and Johnson) or to the romantic styles that appeared in the later 18th and 19th centuries. Comparing the purpose, form, and communication success of the simple language of Robert Boyle and the Royal Society to the prose of later scientists, sociologists, and critics can illustrate the ways that  style may interfere with the conveyance of ideas. In teaching writing, the heavily Latinate context of most modern grammars needs to be opposed in favor of clarity, good construction, and effective communication of the author's ideas. (LH)",

Thomas W.

Concerned with illuminating pain, human imperfection, and man's failure to measure up to his own or the world's concept of perfection, comedy provides &quot;an escape, not from truth but from despair.&quot; If tragedy says that some ideals are worth dying for, comedy asserts with equal seriousness that the value of life lies in the living of it. The comic vision, however, as utilized in the tragedy and comedy of Shakespeare, takes on a unique function, serving to heighten rather than relieve tension. Such is the effect in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; of the death of Mercutio (the comic man) which prefigures the pain and destruction to come. The diminution of Antony in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; renders him implicitly comic, at the  same time creating a tension between what the character is and what he becomes once his tragic nature begins to dominate. Finally, and most complex, is the use of an ominous and ugly sexuality to create the tone in &quot;Measure for Measure,&quot; which ends in an uneasiness just beneath the surface. The use of the comic spirit is one way to help students discover relevance in Shakespeare, for today's age often seems to turn tragedy into comedy. (MF)",

Basically, such curriculum structuring utilizes three approaches--the joint study of two or more subjects (often literature and history), the use of a broad thematic approach, and the treatment of social problems through diverse disciplines. The students are offered greater individual attention and a lessening of the pressure and confinement often found in the traditional English curriculum. An evaluation of these combined classes indicates that they have the advantage of greater opportunity for experimentation, stimulation of students, mastery of skills and work habits, student cooperation,  and self-discipline. Disadvantages include an increased workload and more required knowledge for the teacher, possible neglect of one of the subject areas, and potential failure of the program due to insufficient classroom resources.

As he intervenes in their education, the English teacher should avoid attempting to protect language purity or to hammer out an academic understanding of the disciplines of language, literature, and composition. Instead, he ought to give students an understanding and control of those linguistic structures they cannot absorb elsewhere. Because students cannot master logic and writing simply by existing, the English teacher's office is to teach the written language. He  should understand and appropriate the recent discoveries in the differences between oral and written language and in the systems and psychology of logic. He should encourage his students to be judged by their peers, and he should provide written lessons in inductive logic for elementary children and in deductive logic for adolescents. (JB)",

Contemporary novels and drama have imaginatively combined characteristic Australian themes and myths with European artistic traditions, while poetry has shown a concern with universal qualities, producing an art without parochial boundaries. Because of these reasons and Australian literature's reflection of national life and problems, the teaching of both Australian and English literatures in Australian secondary schools would result in a study of modern literature which is relevant and stimulating for the Australian student. The work of the secondary school literature teacher is of crucial importance, for if a student  is given a good foundation in literature at this level, he is likely to return to literature in adult life.

The third section takes up the particular position of the author as model-maker--his creative capacity, his linguistic resources, and the limiting and defining characteristics of his art. (LH)",

Objective data for evaluation may be obtained through several approaches: (1) key word in context, in which the frequency of a word is accepted as representative of the importance of a concept; (2) analogue, in which texts are checked for the presence or absence of key concepts; and (3) paradigm, in which a researcher projects an ideal methods text as a bench mark against which others may be compared. Another system providing a rough instrument for judging the strengths and limitations of textbooks is the Hare system. Using this letter system, a list of 31 books published between 1958 and 1968 was sent to 100 college English methods  instructors who were asked to rank the books from 1 (highest) to 4. Sixty-one instructors responded. The results of this survey correlated well with earlier data obtained through the use of the other three evaluation systems, showing that Hook's text is best for a general overview of English teaching; Loban, Ryan, and Squire for in-service teachers; Bernstein for highest student interest; Guth for scholarship; and Burton and Simmons for application.

Data indicated that (1) since the greatest change in mean scores between adjacent grades occurred between grades 9 and 10, grade 10 may be the optimum time to teach these  abilities, (2) females seem to acquire these critical abilities earlier than do males, and (3) student scores on verbal argument correlated only low to moderate with their scores on intelligence and reading tests.

        "description":"After completing a freshman course that provides instruction in basic skills and acquaints them with five members of the English staff, students at Orono High School, Maine, can select according to their interests from among 37 courses in diverse areas: folklore, film study, mythology, modern grammar, English literature, expository writing, and seminars in American literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, and the epic. Classified under one of five \"phases\" of difficulty, the courses range from those designed for students who have much difficulty with basic language skills to those for students who have excellent control of basic skills and are looking for stimulating learning experiences. Some courses are multiphased. During the program's brief existence, reaction among students  has been encouraging. Obvious advantages of the program are its built-in flexibility, active student participation in curriculum development, and increased student and teacher interest in the subject matter. (Appendices provide individual descriptions of the 37 courses taught in the program, and a master list of courses indicating phase levels for each.) (LH)",

Research was carried out in two first-grade classrooms located in a predominately Hawaiian working-class suburb of Honolulu. Children were found to be more likely to volunteer narratives in recorded conversations with a familiar adult when they were not answering questions. Since individually directed questions were generally interpreted as negative attention, the typical forms of classroom communication apparently are not the most productive ones. The second part of the study, using the same subjects, evaluated whether the use of nonstandard speech by  first-grade children interfered with their learning to read. Evidence implied that improvement in reading sentences written by the child correlated with an index of the use of standard speech and that the use of nonstandard verbs correlated negatively with the correct identification of pictures used in \"reading readiness\" tests.

Especially in public prose--in which the meaning is the crux of the article or speech--concise, vigorous English demands a minimum of adjectives, a maximum use of the active voice, nouns carefully chosen, a logical argument with no labored or obscure points, and no florid rhetoric. Too often, educated students criticize the sensationalism of newspapers while they themselves show a propensity for writing obscurely and pretentiously. Many writers, however, such as Bertrand Russell and Winston Churchill demonstrate that complex ideas can be communicated effectively in simple English with no ostentation. Although mass culture and mass education have become ruthless levellers of prose quality in  public communication, teachers should foster each individual's ability to write competently on a complex subject while discouraging the influence of passing literary fashions.

The concepts begin with a recognition of the social purposes of language (e.g., Teachers recognize the assumption that language is human behavior.) and continue through recognition of the system that is called the English language and the description of that system, which is grammar (e.g., Students learn to analyze and create sentences of varied style and dense texture resulting from transformations and other stylistic treatments of grammatical structure.). Because the learning of the parts of the  system develops the need to perform language operations, behavioral objectives are coordinated with each learning concept. (Author/LH)",

Tape recorded data were collected for 12 years from 211 children in Oakland, California. Data collected during the first three grades were used to define eight \"language style groups\" (research groups) and statistics recorded during grades 10-12 were used to assess and predict language facility and growth. To create the research groups, three test or rating variables (e.g., intelligence test and verbal performance scores) and 15 language variables (e.g., \"average length of communication unit\") were utilized.  The basic hypothesis--children will not change with age their relative positions to each other in language behavior--was supported with respect to speech conventionality but not supported with respect to problems of mazes (groups of words not resulting in meaningful communication). It was supported with respect to fluency, dependent clauses, and elaboration index for students who began as poor users of oral English. These results have several implications for curriculum development, especially in the teaching of reading. (LH)",

The Institute is a private, predominantly Negro, nonsectarian, co-educational, liberal arts college. A sample of these students were retested in their sophomore, junior, and senior years. Because of the relatively small number of gains, there did not appear to be an adequate basis for concluding that college years had a significant impact upon the intelligence quotient of these students. Findings were inconclusive as two prime variables, test  practices and socioeconomic influences, were not accounted for. The findings are also held to be unexplainable without further investigation. Suggestions for further study include the effects of self-concept, frustration, paternalistic college environment, home and religious influences, and segregation upon test performance.

In view of the predicted oversupply of teachers, the school system must try to select teachers who will function best in the classroom, be able to see his role as a teacher instead of as a functionary, and give a longer period of service to teaching. The involvement of all relevant parties in the program is essential for success. A commitment to the human-centered aspect of teaching is crucial if the teacher is to reach the child. The focus of teaching must be directed to goals which are clearly related to the function of teaching. Feedback to teachers concerning the  results of programs, the new procedures, the community concerns, and other matters relating to the school in a disadvantaged area is critical if programs are to receive the support of the teaching staff.

Although individualized treatment was used, students were typically organized into groups--i.e., remedial, corrective, accelerative--where common needs existed. Program benefits are typically  indicated by an increase in student group average score on a standardized reading test following the course of instruction. At least one program--SGCP--attempted to modify the self image of its students.

The application of psychological and other social scientific techniques to investigate these matters and the use of the information to properly program compensatory education for the poor are being attempted by the Education Improvement Program in Durham, North Carolina. Three neighborhoods of the larger community of about 100,000 have been selected by the poverty authority as areas of greatest economic and social deprivation, two areas predominantly of Negro residents and one of mostly Caucasian. In these neighborhoods the poverty  program has begun various social and economic interventions including day care centers for children. The plan has been to work primarily with samples of children in the three areas using classroom operations, but the program includes a social work component for gathering data about the home, liaison with parents about the school program, and referral of the family to social service resources as indicated. The goal of the program is to apply learning theory and sociological information to the problem of teaching the children to learn those social and cognitive skills necessary to educational achievement and to value such attainment.

        "description":"This job corps center program is designed for male school drop outs from low socioeconomic backgrounds and ages 16 through 21 years, whose entrance test scores reveal marked deficiencies in reading. Three thousand of the dropouts were enrolled in a foundation reading program designed to advance skills sufficiently for the students to take advanced vocational classes. The reading program had the following impact during 1967-68. The 1967 enrollee spent 3.9 months in the program, gaining one to two months in vocabulary development and three and one-half to four months in reading comprehension for each month spent in the program. The 1968 enrollee gained five to seven months in vocabulary development and five to 12 months in reading comprehension for each month he studied in the  program. The discrepancy in results may be due to either the superiority of the 1968 program or biased data due to incomplete results for 1968. The key elements in the success of the program appear to be the diagnosis of reading deficiencies, the individualization of instruction, the multi-media approach, the observed high motivational level of students, and the teamwork of skillful staff members.

Feedback from end to means regulates learning a given activity. The task or goal structure provided by the environment may play its most important role early in life and gradually decline in importance. When the goal structure of the environment (its means-end relationships) is out of kilter, many of the intellectual phenomena labeled cultural deprivation result. Although people may fail to realize goals, the environment may fail to provide a growth-promoting sequence of them. The goals set for the child by his caretakers and the relation of these to the child's available means is a critical factor in determining the  rate of cognitive growth in the early formative years. The problem of maintaining compensatory educational gains may thus be the absence of an adequate goal structure; no amount of past \"catching up\" is going to affect the course of present or future learning. Further, school learning is characteristically separate from any immediate goal, thus provoking the issue of \"relevance.\" (JM)",

        "description":"The investigation in this study of inner-city elementary schools identified two main causes for successful learning environments. The strongest influence was thought to be the principal. An analysis of \"problem oriented schools\" showed that successful principals were prone to act independently of bureaucratic directives, and that they heeded teacher advice and attended to their needs; while the unsuccessful principals were more rigid and hierarchy oriented. The way that schools grouped students for academic work also appeared to be a factor. Schools which had grades K-6 had fewer discipline problems than those with K-8. This finding was attributed to the difficulty of disciplining junior high students and the influence of these more defiant seventh and eighth graders on younger  students. Furthermore, teachers favored the self-contained classroom over the departmental system, since having one group of students enhanced both the teacher's disciplinary success and the warmth and mutual respect between teacher and student. Recommendations made in this study were: the hiring of principals with administrative skills necessary for running inner-city schools; elimination or minimization of formal written and oral qualifying examinations and of irrelevant credential requirements for picking administrators; and, pre-service and in-service training programs for administrators.

The initial sections consider what general assumptions must be met by any satisfactory explanation of the distribution of disorders. Mathematical models are constructed which embody the most prevalent assumptions as to the determinants of community riot-proneness, and their predictions are compared with empirical data. The specific assumptions considered are: (a) all cities have an identical probability of experiencing a disorder; (b) communities are heterogeneous in their underlying riot-proneness; (c) a process of reinforcement characterizes the occurrence of disorders; and, (d) contagion among communities contributes to the distribution of  racial disturbances. Only the heterogeneity assumption is supported by the data. The concluding sections consider the explanatory abilities of several additional theories, each of which argues the importance of particular community characteristics.

It is also proposed that these deleterious effects follow directly from their presence in a class where over a certain proportion of the student body is black. Social and psychological mechanisms contributory to the deleterious effects are explored. Socio-economic status along with inter-school  mobility are also identified as two additional important variables. Tables giving test scores and results are included. (KG)",

Toward the end of administrative change and innovation, a research and development officer is needed, whose authority can cross-cut existing channels of authority. School should be seen as a social system, as the high school especially is a crucial element in regulating the life chances of inner-city children. Two different teacher models that could be well adapted to the slum school are (1) the teacher-counselor who would be in charge of 10 to 15 students and act both as teacher and counselor, and (2) the teacher-manager. The latter model would act as coordinator between the classroom and the social agencies and family contacts. The teacher would have a staff of teaching  aides and volunteers and the assistance of school-community agents. A continuous development curriculum (in which the student is evaluated every six to eight weeks until he is able to pass or repeat in variant form a given set of materials), three hours of individual attention per student each week, mutual support associations for teachers, mobilization of legal resources, public school responsibility for inservice training, cultural enrichment programs, and family participation through community contacts are recommended.

Of about eight million children whose families cannot afford the cost of a school meal, three million receive a lunch free or at reduced cost; of the five million denied reasonable access, three million could be served immediately because they attend schools where the program now is operated. The remaining two million attend schools where local service is not available now. Although Congress, both in the National School Lunch Act of 1946 and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, recognized the moral need for action, its prime concern has been how the money has been spent, rather than whether funds are meeting the need.  Under Section 25 of the Agricultural Appropriations Act of 1968, sponsored by Representative Carl Perkins, an additional $45,000,000 was allocated. But most states use these funds to hold down the prices of regular school lunches, thus benefiting the middle-class youngsters at the expense of the poor. (JM)",

        "description":"This report presents the results of a study from July 1965 to July 1969 on the effects of year-long prekindergarten programs for disadvantaged children involving eight school districts in New York State and approximately 1,800 children. The study focused on factors which the schools considered important and major objectives of their programs. These were intelligence, language, self-concept, and physical development. The study was a true experimental design with two replications. The basic data were collected by individualized tests and measurements (pretest and posttest) for the prekindergarten year for three waves of children. Posttesting was completed in the follow-up years. Reports and ratings by teams of observers, as well as teachers and program directors, were made in each  of the three years. Each child's parent was interviewed. The cognitive programs were able to close some of the gap between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged children. However, the difference that remained exceeded the difference overcome. Further, the results were achieved only by the cognitive-oriented programs, and not by the nursery-oriented or early childhood-oriented programs. (JM)",

The study focuses on the implications of ongoing research by the Institute for Developmental Studies (IDS) for the further understanding of the independent behavior of children in and out of the classroom, and also on the effectiveness of the IDS classroom procedures. In the evaluation procedure, behavioral rather than standardized test criteria were used, both in the classroom and in a &quot;transfer&quot; situation; classroom observation followed by rating of third-grade children from the demonstration program on &quot;systematically developed, reliable, behavioral checklists&quot; was used. The findings of the study  indicated that the expectations of reliability and usability of the classroom behavior checklist were realized. However, it was found that independence of behavior in children--at least in the age group of the subjects tested--does not &quot;carry over&quot; into situations outside the classroom. Further, the nature of the task, situation, and the requirement placed before the child were found to seem to be of key significance.

Interlocking screening tests suitable for administration by the Head Start physician and teacher, have been developed by selecting objective items which predict academic achievement and relate to indices of neurological involvement. Norms are provided for four and one-half to seven and one-half year old children in both the disadvantaged and general populations.
