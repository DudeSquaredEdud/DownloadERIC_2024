        "description":"This annotated bibliography aims at bringing together most of the English-language materials on adult education in Continental Europe published during the 25 years since the end of the Second World War. In accord with the variety of concepts and differences of opinion on definitions of what does or does not constitute adult education, which abound among European adult educators in the countries covered, and wishing to make the bibliography as broad and useful to as wide a field as possible, the broadest possible concept of adult education verging on education of adults was used in selecting items for inclusion in the bibliography. Subjects include vocational education for adults, training in business and industry, adult secondary and university level credit study, activities of  museums, art galleries and libraries, and liberal adult education. Most of the material covered by this bibliography is mainly descriptive, including many observations and impressions of English and North American adult educators visiting European countries. The bibliography is organized by country, with a section on Europe and a section on Scandinavia. A total of 25 countries is covered. A list of periodicals systematically searched for materials is included. A total of 857 annotations are entered in this bibliography. An additional 102 sources available in Joint Publication Research Service Periodicals in microfilm only are included. (Author/CK)",

Recommendations include: (1) The Administration should develop a mechanism at the federal level to coordinate and possibly consolidate all existing programs that have as a major thrust the post-secondary continuing education of adult citizens; (2) The State governments should develop state-wide administrative agreements through the utilization of educational resources to implement effective and efficient programs in continuing education in cooperation with federal agencies; (3) Steps should be taken to expand the federal and state roles in  the administration of post-secondary programs for adults under Title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Appended to this Report is a report to the Council of activities conducted under Title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965. It is noted that in the face of severe budget restraints and rigorous re-examination of educational priorities, the Council finds that continuing education and community service needs of the nation have not suffered irreparable damage.

The method outlined here depends upon two propositions: (1) Past behavior is the best guide to future performance; and (2) The interviewer is more likely to conduct a search effectively if he has clearly fixed in his mind what it is he is seeking. This search process is divided into four parts: (1) First considerations, which include considering the job and the qualities and qualifications necessary to carry it out; (2) Preparing to interview the candidate, which entails, among other factors, considering the application in the light of the formal qualifications and age required, examining it to make sure there are no unexplained gaps in dates, and arranging to  reduce or eliminate interruptions; (3) The interview, which aims at ascertaining the candidate's background and finding out how much he knows about the subjects in which he claims to be interested; and (4) Summing up the candidate, which involves three steps: considering the evidence from the past, adding one's own impressions, and making up one's mind.

Approximately 770 participants were at the five  conferences: 200 each in Boston and Kansas City, 150 in Detroit, 140 in Atlanta, and 80 in Boise. Industry representation ranged from two-fifths to four-fifths of the conferees in all the cities except Detroit, where it constituted about one-third of the group. Men constituted the majority of participants in three cities. These conferences were set up as demonstration projects. (CK)",

Curves have been derived that provide estimates of how job performance can be expected to vary as a function of an incombent's aptitude level and amount of job experience. As measured by Job Sample Tests, the performance of men at all levels of aptitude increases with job experience out to approximately five years on the job. During this time, separation between different aptitude groups is generally maintained. Beyond five years, performance of the different groups tends to converge. Scatter plots of these data are used to identify an  empirically based, operational definition of job proficiency. (Author)",

The next section, The Institution and Its Renewal Process, lists the factors required for success by members of an Agricultural Extension Staff in their role as change agents. The Third section, Linking the Institution to Its Publics through Need  Analysis and Leader Involvement, emphasizes that change agents must become intimately acquainted with social system of the area within which educational programs are to be effected. The fourth section, Program Design and Implementation, describes the major challenge confronting change agents as that of translating needs of target publics into a meaningful program design and developing effective strategies for its implementation. A major challenge confronting the educational institution is that of determining the impact of its planned programing efforts in effecting desired behavioral changes in its publics; this challenge is described in Section 5, Program Evaluation and Accountability.

Chapter III emphasizes that the college will use facilities already available and spread throughout the Twin Cities metropolitan area,  including libraries, museums, and churches. Chapter IV describes the major portion of the MMSC faculty as persons from the metropolitan community with full-time responsibilities unconnected with the college, whose key quality must be a commitment to teaching the kinds of students who will enroll in the college. Chapter V emphasizes that the education offered will be competence-based, i.e., degrees will be awarded to students who demonstrate competencies in five areas: basic learning skills, personal growth, civic skills, vocational skills, and cultural-recreational skills. Chapter VI outlines the pilot program, and Chapter VII discusses college administration and governance. (CK)",

It is divided into six chapters. Chapter I describes the seminar design, pointing out that it was structured to fulfill the major purposes of the Seminar, one of which was to help each participating country initiate demonstration projects designed to introduce population and family planning information into adult literacy programs. Chapter II defines literacy as the essential knowledte and skills which enable a person to engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning in his group and community. Chapter III demonstrates that as the level of the wife's education went up so did the use of family  planning. In Chapter IV, an explanation is given for the way in which decisions were reached about the production and use of materials and approaches in teacher training. Chapter V reports on the status of literacy and family planning programs conducted in the various countries participating in the seminar. Chapter VI summarizes and evaluates the seminar. It is concluded that, measured in terms of its stated main objective, the seminar was a success. Appendices A through F contain data on various projects. (CK)",

Complementary objectives are: (1) Educate 200,000 adults through literacy/family planning programs by 1976; (2) Develop appropriate instructional materials; (3) Add and emphasize family life education in the following areas: earning a living, budgeting, family welfare, maternal and child health, and nutrition; (4) Organize and implement a pilot project for 40 classes in two provinces; and (5) Train teachers, supervisors and administrators to work in the program. A field survey of the target population's living conditions, health, and other factors was conducted. Next, a set of educational materials was developed and pre-tested on a group of  illiterates in the Bangkok area. Several approaches designed to keep the student interested in literacy through content relevant to his needs were used in developing the materials. Family life planning is incorporated into the Thai materials as one part of four subject areas which closely affect the family--agriculture, health and family planning, home economics, and civics. Appendices A through E contain useful details on these projects. (CK)",

Section I, A Program Comes into Being, describes the thrust of the overall program, which is to tackle the problems of resistance to family planning arising from tradition, religion, and superstitution, and to develop non-formal functional education programs directed toward out-of-school young adults with the lowest literacy levels. Section II, Program Focus, is described as incorporating family planning materials and instruction into ongoing functional education programs for adults and out-of-school youth in  the process of assisting individuals to acquire attitudes, concepts and skills essential to problem solving. Section III, The Strategy of Program Development, involves four aspects: country programs, regional support programs, worldwide support programs, and program targets and phasing. (Author/CK)",

For the purposes of this conference, continuing education was defined to include postgraduate education, staff development, inservice training, and adult education. For these purposes, mental health was defined to include health promotion and illness prevention and treatment and the business of families, communities, States and nation, even while the ultimate focus is upon individuals. Broad objectives of the conference included: (1) to identify continuing education needs; (2) to suggest priorities, or methods, which administrators could use to arrive at appropriate objectives for their organizations; and (3)  to provide mental health administrators and educators greater familiarity with continuing education expertise which is available. The following major points of emphasis characterized the conference: (1) diversity of resources and concerns for continuing education in mental health, (2) unusually broad definitions of continuing education and mental health, and (3) involvement of the adult learner in the process of assessing needs. Highlights of the conference evaluation indicate that there were individual extremes of praise and dissatisfaction, and that considerable participant learning occurred. (Author/CK)",

A total of 82 participants from 15 Mid-Eastern and African countries attended. The purpose of the workshop was to assist each country to prepare a work plan for information and education activities related to population programs. A major feature of the workshop was the development and use of two simulation exercises. The first exercise describes a country called &quot;Arcadia,&quot; which had no population policy and no real interest in developing a population program. With the help of resource advisors, country teams were systematically lead through the educational problem: setting clear objectives and deciding program strategy for achieving objectives. The  second exercise described a country called &quot;Valhalla,&quot; which had a stated policy to reduce population growth rates and a large number of established clinics, largely unused. Again, conference participants worked at solving the problem of information dissemination and changing attitudes. After the completion of the two simulation exercises, country work plans were developed with the help of a questionnaire completed by the delegates prior to their arrival in Teheran. (Author/CK)",

The replies of 74 organizations in 52 countries, with a total of 100 projects and 133 courses, are included in this report. The seven categories into which the replies are categorized are: organization, programs (courses), methods and teaching aids, materials, participants, drop-outs, and instructors. The replies are discussed and presented in statistical tables and graphs. Examples of instructional materials used in some of the projects are included. Conclusions reached include (1) greater interest by the governments would aid considerably in solving  project problems; (2) the literacy level attained in most projects is too low to prevent relapse into illiteracy; (3) large classes are more effective than small ones and also decrease the number of instructors needed; (4) a gradual transition from traditional to functional literacy programs is desirable, with training of instructors and seminars for project planners a concomitant necessity; (5) the high rate of drop-out shows a need to study prospective participants; and (6) systematic studies and experiments should be undertaken in various cultures.

        "description":"A pilot study was conducted to examine selected noncognitive attributes to determine (1) if there were significant differences between norm groups for the attribute measures and the sample population, (2) if there were changes in these attributes as a result of participation in basic education instruction, (3) the association between the noncognitive attributes and independent variables, and (4) whether pretest and posttest scores on the noncognitive attribute measures could classify subjects as being participants and nonparticipants in the selected adult basic education programs. In 10 selected communities in North Carolina, a total of 486 disadvantaged adults were pretested and 381 were posttested. The data from 343 (279 participants and 64 nonparticipants) were used in this  study. The test battery consisted of Rotter's I-E Scale, Haller's Work Beliefs Checklist, Rundquist and Sletto Minnesota Survey of Opinions (three scales), Moon and McCann's Scale and McClosky and Schaar's Scale, and Fitts' Tennessee Self-Concept Scale. The data were treated by one-way analysis of variance, least squares regression technique, and multivariate discriminate analysis. Results show: (1) no significant differences were detected between participants and nonparticipants in adult basic education; (2) independent variables associated with dependent variables were participation, sex, reported monthly income, and social participation scores; (3) the noncognitive measures were not effective in distinguishing participants.

        "description":"Six papers serve to provide an in-depth look at a psychology graduate program in which the clinical faculty and some graduate students and their wives assisted in the initial training of public school staff and students. The focus was on interracial conflicts. The first paper discusses the general goals for the graduate students, the school staff and student trainees, as well as week-end practicum participants. The overall design of the program is intended to provide graduate students with training in what can be called \"community psychology,\" i.e., the establishment of educational roles with communities in an effort to reach more people in more fundamental ways. Three papers explore the impact on the various persons involved. Both positive and negative evaluations are included.  The implications of the Interracial Sensitivity Program for graduate training in clinical psychology are elaborated. Powerful practitioner tools, relevant to contemporary social crises, are seen as a major outcome of such a program. A final paper concerns the interface between black youth and sensitivity groups, and suggests the need for a modified and more suitable technology. (TL)",

The first used a behavioral assessment technique (the Group Assessment of Interpersonal Traits [GAIT]) to measure the qualities of understanding, openness and accepting-warmth in college students. Subsequently, these students served as group leaders with chronic patients in a state mental hospital. Results indicate: (1) that the behavioral assessment technique is reliable; and (2) that there are significant relationships between these therapeutic qualities as measured and independent measures of patient ward improvement. The 2nd study used a control group design to examine the impact, on student attitudes, of their participation as companions or group  leaders in state mental hospitals. The results show that, while the groups were initially quite similar on the attitude measures, following participation only the experimental group significantly increased in favorable attitudes toward mental patients.

Those selected: (1) consider the juxtaposition of housing and other land uses; (2) relate density to desired patterns of social interaction; and (3) by clustering dwellings around a common open space, aim at creating a sense of place or spatial identity to contribute to residents' feelings of satisfaction. The data from the study are presented to investigate the relationship of these objectives to the reactions of residents living in neighborhoods of varying densities. In general, residents of higher density neighborhoods did not know their neighbors  better and were less satisfied with their neighborhood than those residing in areas of lower density.

It is argued that research must focus on improved descriptions of the abilities which constitute the essence of intelligence in the most active years of adulthood and it is suggested that some of these abilities will indicate a form of independent, creative thinking that is not well-assessed by existing tests designed for  youth.

Heavy involvement of youth in planning and conducting the programs was deemed essential. Described are the University of Idaho's crisis intervention telephone answering service, John Hopkins community  center's use of information dissemination, counseling and creative therapy, the Ann Arbor University of Michigan's extraordinary array of services for drug users, and the activities of a Brotherhood of black students in New York City.

        "description":"To determine children's knowledge of the less frequent grammatical usages of words that may occur in more than one part of speech, lists of such words were developed. The grammatical functions of 1220 common words from two word counts were examined; about 50% were found to be grammatically ambiguous. Data were collected from about 1500 children in grades 3, 6, and 9 to learn in what parts of speech 240 grammatically ambiguous words would be used when the children wrote sentences illustrating their uses. About 55% of these words were used \"infrequently\" in one or more of their possible parts of speech. An intensive study was made of the comprehension, by 2000 third, sixth, and ninth graders, of 63 words with infrequently used grammatical functions. Findings showed that for about  90% of these words, children had significantly more difficulty in comprehending the infrequent grammatical functions than the more usual grammatical ones. It was concluded that acquisition of lexicogrammatical information about grammatically ambiguous words is a slow process, far from complete at grade 9. Development of this knowledge is moderately well correlated with general vocabulary knowledge. It is recommended that English curriculums pay greater attention to the explicit teaching of the less frequent grammatical functions of ambiguous words. (Author/JMC)",

The first day's study begins with the writing of alternatives to Neil Armstrong's \"Great leap for mankind\" speech. This is followed by a study of the wording of the plaque left on the moon by the crew of Apollo 11 and culminated in role playing by students of the first American landing on Mars. In following lessons, students study the role of persona and audience  in written composition, write their own reactions to space travel, and do exercises dealing with appropriateness in language usage.

For this study, the freshman class of music majors (60) at Northeast Louisiana State College was randomly divided into a control and an experimental group. The control group received instruction in the aural skills in the traditional manner for 2 class hours each week, while the experimental group received an equivalent amount of training but with the Trythall method of instruction. Reliability of the data-gathering instrument was confirmed by administering  test items to students at two other colleges. Test results favored the Trythall experimental group, which showed significant gains in written skills (e.g., melodic and harmonic dictation) but not in sight singing.

Musical excerpts representing a balance among Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern-Contemporary stylistic periods, which ranged in length from 6 to 30 seconds, were copied and \"mutilated\" to produce a pool of 243 possible test items. To compose mutilated versions, only one of the elements--rhythm, melody, or harmony--was changed, while a distortion was devised that was inherently weak by being erratic, inconsistent, illogical or mixed up. Items were recorded and  evaluated on a five-point scale of difficulty for elementary pupils. Based on three out of four earlier experimental tests, two forms of the fifth test--composed of two parts--were administered (1 week apart) to the same 448 elementary school children. Evaluation of the test and recommendations for improving it were then made.

There is, however, often a discrepancy between the intended academic environment (as expressed by the institution in a variety of ways), and that perceived by the students. In order to explore this discrepancy, which may exist between the intended and the perceived institutional press, it is important to have an accurate measure of the environment. Most existing instruments do not use student perceptions to assess the school's environment but rely on other data sources. Accordingly, the Perceived Environment Profile (PEP) was developed for this purpose, based on Pace's College and University Environment Scales (CUES). PEP is a 55-item scale containing statements about high schools which are categorized into five sub-scales:  Practicality, Community, Awareness, Propriety, and Scholarship. A pilot study, conducted to ascertain the most discriminating items, yielded 11 items for each sub-scale. Reliability estimates using the Kuder-Richardson Formula 21 yielded an average coefficient of +.86. PEP requires 20-30 minutes to administer and the Flesch regression formula indicates that it is of low level reading difficulty. It is concluded that in this study PEP demonstrated its potential value as a valid instrument to measure characteristics or the environmental press of the secondary school. (PR)",

In this context, the following problem areas for linkage agents are discussed: weaknesses in the current theoretical models for change, barriers to change, the need to improve school and classroom environments, the fact that educational innovations require new patterns of behavior in a new social context, feedback mechanisms, the need for support systems, training procedures for linkage agents, and the lack of reward and the rootlessness of research  utilization agents. Notwithstanding the latter, educators who have the ability and the desire to act as linkage agents will find themselves directly involved in the most pressing problems of the 1970's.

Recently, however, a theoretical model based on the premise that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior was formulated. This model was used in a longitudinal study with a sample of 1037 males and 897 females at a southeastern university. Nontest variables were 389 biographical items drawn from a pool of over 2000 items and assembled into a questionnaire. Subgroups were formed on the basis of scores on biographical factors, thus clustering similar profiles, rather than on the item responses. A cross validation study was carried out with a 118-item biographical questionnaire. Two  types of educational criteria were used: (1) grade point average and (2) number in a subgroup who were in an arts-science curriculum, number with one or more dean's list, number with one or more probation or dismissal, or number of dropouts. Relationships between these criteria and subgroup membership were univariately and multivariately analyzed. Subgroup structure was stable over a two-year period. The relationship between group membership and selected educational criteria was confirmed, showing that knowledge of a person's past behavior can permit meaningful prediction of educational progress. The female and male biographical factors, subgroup differences on biographical factors and selected criteria and group means are included. (CK)",

This study tested this hypothesis by selecting two groups of college students of markedly different backgrounds and with large differences in analogy test scores.

Since a fundamental prerequisite for program evaluation is a statement of the objectives of the educational system, a set of system goals is proposed. These goals would provide a framework of criteria for analyzing educational programs and for determining policies and procedures. An evaluation data base is then suggested as a means of handling the accumulation, storage, processing, and analysis of the vast amount of information necessary to the evaluation process. The development and capabilities of such an evaluation data system are outlined. The Planning, Research and Evaluation Division is considered as basic to the implementation  of the evaluation strategy. The division's proposed functions would include the establishment of definitions, measures, criteria, and planning goals for programs in relation to system objectives; the maintenance of a record of all special and experimental programs and the evaluation of the same; the development of a student, staff, program, and school data system for use in both short and long term evaluation; and finally, the direction of research studies focused on the improvement of the entire evaluation process.

Variables from personality and intellective areas were employed in conjunction with biographical data. The independent study course, the Audio-Tutorial System, consists of independently scheduled, but structured, laboratory and learning sessions, audio tape tutorial presentations, an emphasis on personal student-instructor contact, and periodic oral and written quizzes, all conducted within the large class setting. A sample of 315 students were enrolled in this course, while 315 were enrolled in the traditionally organized course.  Results indicated that for the high achievement subgroup, mathematics reasoning skills and science achievement were significantly related to success in the audio-tutorial course. In the traditional course, verbal aptitude, mathematical computation skills, and restraint were significantly related to success. Variables were identified which may facilitate the prediction of individual success in specific situations, the placement of students in alternative learning systems, and the provision of remedial counseling and instruction. Further research is suggested. (PR)",

It is argued that the Report of the Phi Delta Kappa Study Committee on Evaluation does not adequately treat this concept, nor does it adequately consider some implications of the concept for the methodology of evaluation. The centrality of explanation to evaluation should be emphasized. This perspective highlights existing evaluation methodology (context, input, process, and product) in terms of appropriateness to decisions to be served (explanations to be made) in the evaluation process. This approach identifies gaps in current methodology and provides clues as to how to close those gaps. (Author/DG)",

The Design Board Program teaches the child a systematic method for analyzing complex two-dimensional graphic patterns. It is based on the theory that accurate replication of geometric designs depends on the child's ability to view a design as though it was a construction of individual elements arranged on a matrix of vertical and horizontal coordinates. Ten children participated in the experiment, 5 of whom received training during the course of the year. Each child, in turn, attended daily training sessions, lasting 15-20 minutes, for an average of about 20 sessions. The five performance subtests of the Wechsler  Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence were individually administered to all the children at six-week intervals. The results, when the trained and non-trained children were compared, seem to support the hypotheses that the Design Board training program has an immediate, positive effect upon the skills involved in copying designs, and that the effect is generalized to other psychomotor tasks.

Piaget's and Kohlberg's conceptions of moral judgment are presented along with one method of estimating a subject's level of development. The concept of a latent trait is developed. Its relationship to a stage sequence, through stating the probability of being in each stage, is illustrated in a non-technical manner. Using nine situations or stories pointing up a moral dilemma, the stage boundaries within stories, the discriminating powers of the stories, and the latent trait value parameters are derived using maximum likelihood procedures. The calculation of discriminating power requires the derivation of a new form of polychric  correlation coefficient. Various studies reported in the literature concerning differences in moral judgment among ages, sexes, socioeconomic classes and culture are replicated and the procedures developed here applied to the data. Finally, the tests of the assumptions required by the model, the results of the above replications, and the generalizability of the method of analysis are discussed in some detail. (Author/DG)",

Studies have found 3 major factors (Evaluation, Activity, and Potency) in analyzing reactions of diverse subjects to different concepts on rating scales. Although, used together, these factors allow greater discrimination than a unidimensional or bidimensional approach, there are difficulties in visualizing the relationships in three-dimensional data analyses. Methods for the preparation of instruments which allow balanced presentation and/or samplings of concepts, scales, origin and width of end  points, are explained. These instruments, analyses, and the display technique facilitate quick and easy interpretation and presentation of semantic differential data. Several studies conducted during the past two years are used to illustrate both the approach and the type of displays resulting from various subject groups, scales, and concepts.

        "author":["Chen, Martin K."],
        "description":"Generally, ratings have notoriously low inter-rater reliabilities. Because of differences in orientation, background, and expectations, ratings are seldom made from the same point of reference; thus, many types of error mask the true rating variance. Guilford's technique identified most types of constant error by analysis of variance and then eliminated by an adjustment technique. This, however, does not remove all possible errors; it only \"cleans up\" the ratings to the extent these known errors no longer contribute to the error variance. The technique, moreover, is not applicable where not all raters have ratings for all ratees on all traits. It is proposed that if the number of missing values is relatively small, one of several methods be used to estimate the missing data  before an analysis of variance is performed. Depending on the validity of the statistical assumptions made in the estimation, these methods are capable of producing reasonable estimates for the missing data. Three possible methods are illustrated with data taken from Guilford's work. The accuracy of the methods is compared before performing the analysis of variance and making the required adjustments. Further, the inter-rater reliabilities of the adjusted data and of the unadjusted data are estimated, using the Spearman-Brown formula by analysis of variance. A comparison of the two reliability coefficients reflects the degree to which the adjustment has been useful. (Author)",

Experimental procedures, hypotheses, and findings are discussed as they relate to these variables. Three major conclusions drawn from the results of the study include: (1) individual integrative complexity is strongly predictive of performance on the tasks of making time estimates of occurrence of remote future events, and changing those estimates in light of controlled information  feedback; (2) individual integrative complexity is consistently predictive of convergence; and (3) differential time delay of information feedback has a significant effect on the performance of individuals involved in the Delphi process. The assumption that the phenomenon of convergence in the direction of a &quot;correct solution&quot; is a product of objectivity relatively free from the interference of certain psychological variables is considered unfounded. It is also contended that non-objective factors are as reflective of outcomes in a Delphi exercise as they are in direct confrontation group outcomes.

An instrument was constructed in the semantic differential format. Teachers were asked to respond anonymously on adjective scales to eleven example classroom procedures designed as applications of the assumptions of individualized reading instruction. Reliability of the instrument was high (.925); content validity was demonstrated for the examples and adjectives used in the instrument. Two studies validated the instrument experimentally. In one, teachers' attitude inventory scores were compared by a t-test in two types of schools: ones in which the WDRSD had been adopted; and ones in which no known emphasis  was placed on individualization. Mean inventory scores were significantly higher (p&lt;.05) in the schools where individualization was systematically provided for than in the other schools. In another study the change in teachers' attitudes was studied after a school had adopted the WDRSD. Teachers' inventory scores in the fall prior to inservice training were compared by a t-test for matched pairs to those obtained in the spring after one year's use of the system. The spring scores were significantly higher (p&lt;.001) than those obtained before use of the WDRSD. A copy of the instrument is appended.

Multivariate analyses of variance were carried out using the study behavior dimensions as the independent and the performance factor scores as the dependent variables. High achievement was found to be related, independently of mode of assessment, to two kinds of study strategy, reproductive and transformational, and  the appropriateness of each depended on the student's value-motivational orientation to his course work.

Post hoc analysis of ninety test protocols had indicated that the original thirty-five card test could be shortened to improve the test's reliability. This analysis also showed that males were responding to certain cards differently from females. Consequently, two versions of the test were made for field testing. The one for males consisted of twenty cards, for females sixteen cards. There was an overlap of twelve cards common to both versions. One hundred students in two urban, middle-class high schools were tested with the modified versions. Reliability coefficients were .74 for males and .81 for females, compared to coefficients varying from .51 to .70 for the original test. The  implications of the study are that several versions of the test should be constructed for other population segments, providing a more reliable diagnostic educational instrument. (Author)",

These movements deserve greatly increased historical research. Many current innovations in education have been tried in the past and found wanting. Study of the pioneer educational researches reveals the discovery of educational principles still accepted and those which have been modified as a result of more recent research. The Progressive Education Movement has been subjected to much historical research. Similiar study of the educational research and of the testing movements might reveal comparable effects on instructional objectives, methods, and materials. Much of the history of educational research and measurements has dealt with  the efforts of various persons -- G. Stanley Hall, Dr. J. M. Rice, E. L. Thorndike, and so on. There has been little concern for conditions producing, and influenced by, these movements. How much is to be credited to awareness of individual differences and abandonment of formal discipline? To what extent was the Committee of Ten appointed in 1892 by the NEA s stimulus to educational research? What effect did the scientific management movement have on educational testing and research? (It affected J. M. Rice and Leonard Ayres.) How has the development of statistical methods influenced the quality of educational research? (Author)",

The Precision-Power-Gradient theory is suggested as a means of structuring an introductory graduate course in statistics. Twelve RSTs are considered, ranging from normative comparisons (at the simplest level), through parametric/non-parametric statistics, analysis of variance and covariance, correlations, factor analysis, to canonical correlation analysis, and, briefly, other advanced techniques. Equally  important is a working knowledge of the computer, which enables the RSTs to be used with greater facility and accuracy. Computer orientation should include a basic knowledge of FORTRAN programming, nature and availability of computer-based statistical libraries, the ability to utilize such libraries, with a general understanding of computer output.

The Cornell Learning and Study Skills Inventory (CLASSIC) was developed to assess these factors, to serve as a means for corrective action in the area, and also to enable individuals to make a self assessment of these factors determined to be critical to learning effectiveness. Each of the seven part scores on CLASSIC covers one of the factors: (1) Goal Orientation, (2) Activity Structure, (3) Scholarly Skills, (4) Lecture Mastery, (5) Textbook Mastery, (6) Examination Mastery, and (7) Self Mastery. A Reading Validity Index is a rather unique aspect of  CLASSIC. Eleven pairs of items are designed in such a manner that one item in each of eleven pairs of items is a reversal or partial reversal of the other; so that if the subject marks one item in a certain manner, he must mark the second item in the pair in a reverse manner to have self-agreement. Where there is an absence of self-agreement, the Inventory scores are not considered to be valid. Forms for both secondary and college students are available from Psychologists and Educators Press, Jacksonville, Illinois. Reliability for both forms is in high 80s and low 90s for the 120 items on the inventory. (Author/PR)",

A generalization of the Johnson-Neyman tests of significance (originally developed for two groups and two covariables, but frequently ignored by many critics of analysis of covariance) to cover any number of groups and covariables is presented. The procedure is viewed as a powerful tool for measuring the relationship between learner  characteristics and teaching strategies when the regression slopes are not homogeneous. Aided by computer technology, it is proposed as a relatively easy method for classification of students by their individual needs as well as by the characteristics of teaching methods. (CK)",

The four methods of missing data estimation were: means substitution, simple regression, stepwise regression, and multiple regression. In order to extract all possible variance, the Principal Components Analysis was employed without rotation. Factor scores from complete data and each of the estimated data solutions were obtained. Goodness-of-Fit was judged on the basis of cross-correlations of each estimated data solution with the solution derived from complete data. The study showed  that all four methods of estimation compared fairly well with the criterion. The average correlations improved from the method using least concomitant information (means substitution) to that employing most (multiple regression).

In spite of an ever-increasing financial outlay at all governmental levels, schools are falling short of expectations of those who must use the products of public education. The answer to, \"Why can't the schools improve the product?\" will not be found through use of industrial concepts, but by a better understanding of the learning process. The effectiveness of Skinner's learning psychology as applied in the Auto-Paced Teaching Process (APT) as compared to conventional instruction is tested. The sample included 132 college science students: 44 in APT group; 88 in the conventionally taught control group. Subjects were randomly assigned to groups.  Treatment variable tested was the effect of Skinner's contingencies of reinforcement employed in instruction of the APT group. Criterion tests included achievement tests, Purdue Attitude, STEP-Listening, Welch Science Process Inventory, and Science Unit Rating Scale. ANOVA of achievement test scores show APT significantly higher at .025 level in 2 of the 3 science topics studied. Covariate analysis of attitude scores significantly favor APT students at .001 level. APT students took 28% less time to complete assigned tasks. Results indicate that application of clinically tested learning theories to classroom instruction will produce greater teaching efficiency. (Author/PR)",

In an earlier study item sampling was demonstrated to be equivalent to student sampling in terms of correlations of item means and standard deviations. It was also found that standard deviations of item-sampled responses were systematically smaller than for student sampling. When the results of that earlier study and the present one were  compared, factor structures of student attitudes were found to be similar if not equivalent. Factors from item sampling had several common items on similar factors gained from student sampling. Item-sampled factors contained many items from the same a priori environments of the original item pool. The congruence of the items in the item-sampled factors was judged to be high, with some notable exceptions which could be attributed to the less than perfect intercorrelation matrix. An example of a typical item sample, consisting of six questions taken from the full 150-item CES is attached. (Author/TA)",

A criterion measure was obtained by cumulating the measurements obtained on the thirty-three pupils every thirty seconds for thirty minutes over a period of twenty days. Various observational designs were created by manipulating the following four variables: (1) the length of the observation period; (2) the time interval between recording observations during the observation period; (3) the number of days (replications) of observing; and (4) the number of pupils observed each day. Through this procedure it was possible to  build observational designs and compare results using each design with the criterion measure, thus determining the efficiency of the several sampling plans. Comprehensive tables are included showing Scott coefficients of agreement with the criterion of the various designs. (Author/LR)",

        "description":"The performance of 131 urban sixth-grade students on the Uses Test of creativity was studied in four environments to determine the effects of testing condition variables and to find optimal testing procedures. Testing condition variables included the giving of grades vs. no grades and individual vs. group administration of the task. The four test environments included combinations of the above alternatives, all with the subjects doing independent written work. Both group testing and the giving of grades were associated with higher scores, and the Group-Grades combination was especially favorable. Of the two variables, grading had the stronger influence. Subjects given grades, when compared to those not given grades, had higher scores for total number of uses, unique uses,  non-unique uses, and total time spent. Subjects tested in groups generated more non-unique uses and spent more time than those tested individually; differences on the other two measures were not significant. Interactions, where present, favored the Group-Grades testing condition. The Group-Grades condition also appears to have advantages over test environments used in previous studies. However, validation of the Uses Test in the Group-Grades environment has yet to be tried. Under the time-free conditions of the present study, time spent on the Uses Test correlated highly with all three performance scores; creativity scores also were independent of IQ. It is suggested that voluntary concentration time may be a key variable differentiating creative and uncreative students on a measure which  is independent of IQ. (Author)",

Similarly, classroom teachers are interested in symmetry if they wish to grade on a &quot;curve.&quot; Previously, the sign test, the Wilcoxon test and the t-test have been used to test a hypothesis concerning the symmetry of a distribution of scores about a location parameter. Another test, which is more powerful than either the sign test (S) or the Wilcoxon test (W), and as powerful as the t-test, when the assumptions under the t are met, is the absolute normal scores test (K). The test utilizes the expected order statistics for a sample of absolute values from the standardized normal distribution. The procedure for utilizing the absolute normal scores test is carefully outlined. Two  hypothetical examples are presented and analyzed by each of the three tests, S, W, and K. The power of the three nonparametric tests when used with various types of frequency distributions is discussed. (CK)",

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to develop and validate a self-report, group-administered, non-verbal inventory to measure Self Perception In School (SPS) among primary grade children. Inventory items were based on Sarbin's Role Theory. Since role may be studied in terms of the actions expected of an occupant of that position, the role of student was defined as those behaviors teachers expect of students. From this universe, a set of items was devised. Three pilot studies were conducted. The final version of the inventory uses 19 cartoon-like drawings in transparency form (dichotomous presentation and responses) to probe an equal number of behaviors. In the major study, the Self Perception in School (SPS) inventory was administered to a sample of 656 first, second, and third  graders in two schools of a white middle-class suburban system. It was concluded that: (1) the SPS inventory is a reliable, valid, inexpensive, non-verbal measure of the construct at the primary level; (2) the structure of the &quot;self&quot; is not unidimensional; (3) the SPS is significantly related, at the primary level, to teachers' ratings of children's behavior and to reading and arithmetic achievement; (4) girls have a more positive self perception in school than boys at the primary level; and (5) while the mean SPS of girls is relatively similar across grades, the mean SPS of boys consistently decreases from grade one through grade three. Means, standard deviations, and reliabilities are listed. See TM 000 409 for a report on correlates of the SPS. (Author/DG)",

The following are considered: the effect of heterogeneous and homogeneous grouping practices on academic achievement and affective development; the tendency of ability grouping to produce separation of students along ethnic and socioeconomic dimensions; and the relationship between these dimensions and achievement on tests used to classify children. It is concluded that grouping practices based on standardized tests not only tend to restrict the quality of the instructional experiences of children with respect to academic and social learning, but also, as a result of ethnic and socioeconomic separation, tend to restrict the overall range of  experiences and learning opportunities available in the classroom.

Seventy percent of the parents said that their children are more interested in school and are receiving a better education today. Although the children say that they enjoy school, some of them feel that in arithmetic and reading skills they do not compare with the other students. Teachers concur with the students that reading and arithmetic are areas of difficulty. The need for special programs is a subject of contention among teachers. Students like to ride the bus, but are somewhat uncertain as to whether they want to next year. Fair treatment by students and  teachers was not an issue, but &quot;different treatment&quot; was. More research into the meaning of &quot;different treatment&quot; is needed. Though home-school cooperation exists, both teachers and parents desire more opportunities to communicate. More teacher home visits are looked forward to. A program of integration from kindergarten through twelfth grade, which will improve the quality of education during this continuing period of transition, is being planned. (Author/JM)",

In particular, the students studied were involved in a special busing program called Operation Hospitality, which was carried out by the Chicago Catholic School Board. Through this program, black grade school students from inner city parochial schools are bused to all-white schools, mostly in the suburbs. Although the program has been under way since 1967, it was decided to try to make attitudinal comparisons between bused and non-bused black students and white classmates and non-classmates to see if there is any reasonable evidence of change. In addition, the performance of students, in terms of grades and achievement tests, is considered. Data for  description of students' attitudes were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire, which included a 20 word-pair semantic differential and a &quot;draw-a-picture&quot; of a person. The report concludes that there is a positive change in the whites' view of blacks; also, the blacks' view of whites is changed in the same direction. Thus, each group improved its image of the other in ways that increase acceptability. Both groups became slightly more interesting to the other. In terms of scholastic performance, there is no significant difference in either grades or performance on tests between the bused or non-bused blacks. (Author/JW)",

In addition to comparing the effect of desegregation, the investigators are interested in identifying the variables related to positive or negative self concepts. The report concludes that there is a self concept gap between Negro and white students, with Negro students having significantly higher scores than white students on the self concept scale. Those Negro students achieving the higher self concept scores are those in segregated or predominantly black schools.

In the first year of the program, 186 Head Start graduates were bused from low income residential areas to four elementary schools located on the periphery of the city. The receiving schools varied in socioeconomic status of pupils from middle class to working class. The 1969-70 school year completed the second year of Wichita's Follow Through Project. Students were evaluated by questionnaires given to teachers; in addition, to measure pupil adjustment and achievement, tests such as the Cognitive Abilities Test, the California Test of Personality, and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities were given. Parent participation was encouraged. The results of the  Cognitive Abilities Test indicate that though Follow Through students scored higher than Head Start students at pretest, by post test there were no significant differences; both groups, however, made significant gains. In the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the experimental Follow Through students, after two years, scored significantly higher than control groups. It is held that the program had some good results. (Author/JW)",

A brief review of pertinent background factors and related research literature is presented, followed by an explanation of the study itself. Subjects were one hundred and sixty black and white students in the Tacoma, Washington, public schools, who ranged from primary to junior high school levels. Of the 96 four-group comparisons of variables, 32 at each level, only four showed significant differences. Three of the four were racial effects, Caucasians scoring higher than Negroes in primary mathematics, intermediate language arts, and intermediate composite. No school effects were indicated at any level. The sole interaction effect indicated that Caucasians  in nonsegregated schools scored higher than Caucasians in de facto segregated schools on the primary composite. Results of the study suggest that neither pupil race nor racial composition of school per se, considered alone or interactively, seemed to have a substantial effect on academic performance when other relevant variables were controlled.

The results indicate that parents and students in Riverside reacted very positively to three years of integrated education. Anglo parents felt that their children were not having more difficulty in learning. Parents of all three groups (Negro, Mexican-American, and Anglo) reported favorable perceptions of busing, the quality of education, social acceptance, and home-school relationships. In the Redlands, the Negro and Mexican-American parents believed that integrated education represents a better education; they also felt welcome in the schools. The parents have rated the quality of desegregated education as high,  although some parents do believe that there are more discipline problems. According to the parents, the children reacted positively to their school experiences, and teachers were quite friendly and helpful to the students. (Editor/JW)",

Although busing has decreased segregation, it has sometimes created problems of its own. Transportation administrators, interviewed in Riverside, Sacramento, Berkeley, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Sausalito, California during the Spring of 1969, indicated several steps a school district can take to facilitate the establishment of a busing program. In this paper, the recommendations made in these interviews are summarized. In the discussion on establishing routes and schedules, such topics as scheduling after school transportation and computerized routing are included. Also, acquiring buses and student  discipline procedures are discussed. It is suggested that consultants' advice be sought before busing is established, and that the chief administrator be carefully chosen. (Authors/JW)",

School enrollments by race for 1970 were furnished for 90 percent of the districts by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare along with compliance status reports. The 1960 U.S. Census and other statistical publications were used. Some results are as follows. Only two of Mississippi's 150 school districts are not desegregated: these are all-black districts. Ninety-three percent of all public school pupils are attending desegregated schools. Eighty-nine percent of Negro pupils and 98 percent of white pupils are in racially integrated situations. While faculty  integration is nearly complete, hiring practices favor the white teachers, and black administrators are being phased out. In almost every instance the ratio of white teachers to black is higher than the ratio of the student body: differences up to 40 percent have been found. While in 1964 there were only three non-sectarian private schools in operation, today there are 236 in operation. One hundred and sixty-three segregation academies are operating in 64 counties with an enrollment of 54,037. (Author/JM)",

Within public systems are found such strategies as direct pressure, utilizing broad Federal and State programs, enlisting under university auspices, accenting innovation, finding new resources, and bargaining. Seventeen projects representing efforts to transform a regular public school program into one in which greater control is exercised by the parents,  residents and/or students of the school community are described.

In time, much of the early optimism of community planners was dampened. The Board of Education's procrastination and its unwillingness to develop guidelines prior to the initiation of the projects helped to sow the seeds of discontent that eventually paved the way for the most volatile teacher strike in the history of New York City. In addition, the frustration and delay encountered by the community people set the stage for total rejection of the &quot;system&quot; by the communities involved. The events and developments in this complex may well serve as guidelines for future community organization, pointing the way for other  communities seeking a way out of the educational decay which has crippled the public school system.

The educational components are based on more than 150,000 observations of children by learning specialists and parents. These tested educational methods are designed to assure that children will build personal self-confidence, that parents will learn how to guide children to maximize their potential, and that family ties will be strengthened through meaningful learn-play experiences involving all members of the family. Comprehensive child-development programs are based on an expansion of UEC's Discovery Program, which has proven successful with more than  3,000 preschool children in five Northeastern states, and a model system designed for four Pennsylvania counties under contract with the Pennsylvania State's Department of Public Welfare. More than 1,800 clearly stated learning objectives and more than 3,600 learning task activities enable parents and learning staff to assess a child's skills and concepts and provide him with individualized learning assitance.

It seeks, within the large urban school, to set up a flexible and intimate learning environment, to provide greater continuity between grade levels, and to enrich the curriculum so that children have a chance to relate to more things and people. The teacher's role is seen as supporting and extending these experiences. A &quot;corridor&quot; can be effectively considered a unit apart from the school and so a &quot;small school&quot; within a big school. Classrooms, from pre-school through second, opening from such a corridor are the program's unit. By opening the doors, enriching equipment in classroom and corridor, and encouraging movement through the  corridor between the classrooms and movement into the corridor, a continuity program, one grade from another even from pre-school, could be established--thus meshing with the actual progress of the child. The program proposes to continue the enriched environment and individualized teacher-child relationship of Head Start, and to show that Head Start gains can be maintained. The program also seeks to create a model for student teachers of individual and small group teaching in the midst of multiple activities. (Author/JM)",

Funds from the Education Professions Development Act and from private foundations have been used to support small projects initiated by the school. About 200 underachieving boys, were selected from the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades of Philadelphia public and parochial schools. During the first two years of PAS, boys remained for a 14-week term; currently the students attend for an entire school year. The PAS program also includes curriculum development, intern training, and staff development activities. During 1970-71, PAS is helping to prepare a core staff group for the  opening of a new middle school in September of 1971. In its external staff development program, PAS works closely with groups of teachers and administrators in six Philadelphia public schools, helping each to plan and operate semi-autonomous units called &quot;minischools.&quot; PAS conducts an intensive summer program for these groups and several PAS staff members are assigned full-time to help the minischools during the school year.

Instruments presumed to measure &quot;anxiety,&quot;&quot;perception of others' attitude toward self,&quot;&quot;self-attitude,&quot;&quot;adjustment,&quot; and &quot;racial attitudes&quot; for this longitudinal study were used in obtaining scores from the same children in the first and third grades. A random sample of children from the Riverside School Study controlled for grade, sex, and ethnicity was used as a comparison to a randomly selected Emerson group. This was done to provide a base from which to view the Third Culture Curriculum effects at Emerson. Such a sampling procedure inherently carries with it the likelihood of confounding effects. Thus, any difference between Emerson and  Riverside School Study pupils on the measures of interest may be due to the Third Culture Curriculum, other factors associated with school and home, or to an interaction of these factors. It is known, for instance, that Emerson School differs from the Riverside School Study sample in their teachers, their administration, their class structures, their rankings as to the socioeconomic status of their clientele, their proportions of student body racial representation, their geographical locations, and possibly other pertinent characteristics. Thus, any conclusions drawn as to the effect of the Third Culture Curriculum are tentative and need substantiation in further studies in other settings. (Author/JW)",

This evaluation report analyzes longitudinally and in cross-section the achievement of students in desegregated schools. In the former analysis, pupils who were in grades K-3 the first year of desegregation are studied. The standardized achievement scores of these students are compared each year with the scores of all students in the district at the same level. It is concluded that: the achievement of bused pupils did not increase; the achievement of pupils desegregated in grade 2 or earlier neither increased nor decreased; and, the achievement of pupils desegregated after grade 2 decreased in comparison to  that of other pupils. The cross-sectional analysis included all bused and receiving pupil grades K-3 each year, from 1965-66 through 1969-70. This study found that: the achievement of pupils in grades K-3 increased from 1966 to 1970; the achievement of bused pupils in kindergarten was significantly higher in 1970 than in 1966, while that of pupils in grades 2 and 3 was slightly lower; and, bused pupils in grades 2 and 3 with low and average achievement achieved less in desegregated schools than they had done in segregated schools.

The study attempts to determine if high-achieving students have developed interrelationships among their cognitive and educative abilities which permit them to acquire cognitive processing systems that are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those developed by low-achieving students, and if such relationships define specific areas of curriculum input that would systematically improve the performance of low achieving students. First, two groups of eighth graders  were located through background information and a battery of achievement tests: one a high-achieving high socioeconomic group, the other a low-achieving low socioeconomic group. Then correlation techniques were used in an attempt to model the hypothetical cognitive processing systems. It appears from preliminary findings that low achievers exhibit a poor quality of achievement because they retrieve and integrate inappropriate bits of information into inefficient cognitive processing systems.

Thirty of the low-performing children were assigned to the experimental condition and 30 to the control condition. The basis for grouping subjects (Ss) into &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; groups were group IQ scores and third grade scores on the Metropolitan Reading Test. The measure of prejudice included several subtests dealing with separate minority groups; it was administered to all groups prior to treatment. Then a two-week training period was given to the experimental group; this included historical and cultural information about several minority  groups. During the two weeks of treatment the experimental group received 30 minutes of this program each school day. Then both groups received the posttest. Statistical analysis revealed that prejudice among these children varied inversely with intelligence, that the treatment program decreased the prejudice of experimental group Ss, that minority children showed a prejudice against themselves, and that the feelings minority children have about themselves were affected by the treatment program.

The problems of inner city education need more such studies, especially longitudinal investigations of the processes by which exceptional teachers and schools succeed in the education of impoverished youth. It may be that the lives of education researchers have been too remote from the schools. Perhaps their direct involvement in the processes with which teachers and administrators are preoccupied would lead them to undertake more studies that afford clear guidance for educational practice. It is understandable that researchers like analytical studies of the relations among isolated variables that we know well how to measure. The data  tend to be objective, and they fit neatly into regression equations or are subject to analysis of variance. These are methodological values that can seldom be realized in studies addressed to complex situations with a multitude of uncontrolled variables. But the process of education involves precisely such situations; and it may be that less refined, partly subjective techniques of investigation can yield insights now unattainable through statistical analysis.

They also ask for an &quot;objective examination of the educational effects of compulsory desegregation.&quot; Although this would slow school integration, such studies would be useful if they also included data on socioeconomic status and race of persons in the same classroom, racial attitudes of classroom teachers and school administrators, presence of ability tracking, the quality of  classroom interaction, etc. Even without these qualifications, no studies have found that the performance of black students declines as a result of desegregation.

They also changed attitudes about concepts related to turmoil on the high school  campus; such concepts as student unrest, militancy, rioting, and the SDS changed in a positive way. In another aspect of the study, it was found that black and white participant attitudes were different relative to a large number of concepts. In general, black participants were more positive than whites toward concepts dealing with unrest and race, and white participants were more positive regarding concepts that are usually considered to be more conservative.

The Center itself is conceived of as achieving integration through usage; eventually it will serve approximately 2,100 students from its immediate area, and also provide educational programs for many others on a city-wide basis. This demands a radical reorganization of the school system's traditional approaches to curricula, teacher-aid technologies, and school architecture. In  addition to innovative educational programs, the Center will offer cultural, auditorium, and exhibition facilities to Pontiac city; in-service training programs for Pontiac's educators; adult education; community services in health, welfare, and family counselling; facilities for pre-school programs; and, civic activities.

The investigators found that: (1) the government's figures on desegregated systems are misleading because individual schools often remain segregated; (2) often the burden has been placed on black schools and parents; (3) within &quot;desegregated&quot; schools, widespread segregation in classrooms and buses and relating to many of the extra-curricular activities still persists; (4) black teachers and staff have been dismissed or demoted; and, (5) the Health, Education and Welfare and the Justice Departments have accepted some desegregation plans  which result in resegregation. Underlying these problems is the mistaken belief that desegregation is simply the mixing of black and white students and no more; little attention is considered to have been paid to the way in which student assignment has been effected, or to what happens to black students and faculty in such situations. The report itself is divided into discussion of school desegregation plans, in-school discrimination, and racial discrimination against black teachers and administrators.

        "description":"This is an evaluation of the College Bound Program (1969-70), which attempts to upgrade on a massive level the academic performance of disadvantaged high school students in New York City so that they will be prepared for college admission and performance. Unique features of the program include small class size, special guidance services, a family assistant program, a summer program, and cultural enrichment activities. In addition, College Bound is committed to providing admission to college; each student accepted into the program is admitted to a college if he earns an academic diploma, meets Regents Examination requirements, and attains an average of at least 70 percent. The primary goal of this evaluation is to determine whether the College Bound Program materially improved the  academic functioning of the students so that they are able to succeed in college. All other evaluation concerns were subsidiary. Among the methods and instruments used were the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT), grades, the Regents examinations, and demographic data. The evaluation report concludes that significant differences in MAT scores were found. However, on the Regents' exam, College Bound students did not show any differences on test scores in comparison with the controls.

The purpose of the meeting was: (1) to present a demonstration illustrating the latest techniques of teaching Afro-American folk music; (2) to show ways of developing in children an appreciation for the musical and cultural contributions of the American Negro; and, (3) to demonstrate the historical and cultural qualities embodied in Afro-American folk music. Bernice Reagon provided an audio-tape of her demonstration. In addition to the tapes and the workshop report, the words to each of the songs have been  included in the text.

Thus, this review of literature concerns itself with the characteristics of the learning environment with the emphasis on the social structure of the school as it affects the learning and behavior of the student both in the present and future. The study was expected to clarify partially some questions relating to talent development, occupational allocation, adaptability of workers, training of workers, worker satisfactions, and performance. The conclusion to be drawn from the study is that the particular structural features of an educational  institution such as the values and goals, the system of authority and control, the reward system, the actual organizational subdivision within the system, as well as its size, the recruitment and characteristics of students, teachers, and administrators all combine to produce a particular educational experience. Variations in any of these should produce a different outcome. Related documents are avilable as VT 011 591-011 595 in this issue. (Author/JS)",

The report provides data on the longest period for followup (nearly 4 years) of any New Careers program and systematically documents the problems of career advancement. In an attempt to measure the impact of paraprofessionals on the participating agencies and to identify the factors involved in mobility, 26 NCEY graduates and 37 agency personnel were interviewed in a cross-section of involved agencies.

The investigation used four sources of data: (1) site visits to 20 service programs across the nation, (2) questionnaire surveys distributed to all service programs in the field and to all schools with two or more clinicians, (3) a random survey of association members, and (4) quantification of students training in the field based on enrollment figures supplied by the available training programs and schools. The study found serious manpower shortages for both speech clinicians and audiologists, despite a 300 percent rise over the past decade in the number of students receiving degrees  in these fields. The results support the need for an educational effort to change negative administrator attitudes regarding the use of supportive personnel to fill manpower shortages. This conclusion was reaffirmed by participants in a 3-day conference held to examine the findings and make recommendations regarding the optimal utilization of professional and supportive personnel.

The findings suggest that high school students develop strong occupational interests early, with at least tentative choices made before they reach the 11th grade. However, occupational information provided in school has little influence on occupational choices, although there is evidence to show that such material is available. Student educational aspirations and expectations, like those considered vocational, are influenced most by the home and friends, but may develop unrealistic aspirations for prestigious  careers when work more appropriate to their abilities should be considered. It was recommended that schools provide early organized and realistic information about career opportunities and that the curricular design should be made more flexible by providing more training options.

Through a work-study arrangement, 422 nurse's aides in the municipal hospital system completed a 14-month LPN training course, dividing their time between shifts at their hospitals (20 hours a week) and classroom or clinical training at central locations throughout the city (25 hours a week). The project was considered a success when 385 graduates (91 percent) were licensed as LPNs after passing the New York State licensing examination and returning to their hospitals where they assumed the  duties of LPNs. Some recommendations were: (1) All nurse's aides should be processed as potential candidates for upgrading; (2) A remedial academic skill center should be established to encourage hospital staff to improve their basic skills; and (3) Counseling and other supportive services should be continued at the training site. The report also describes the organization and costs of the project, the training program, and ways to improve future programs. (SB)",

Nearly 200 interviews were conducted with bank personnel, including policy formulators, policy executors, and lower level personnel. These nonstructured interviews, each of which was shaped according to the person interviewed, were supplemented by data collected independently by a few of the banks. The results show that many minority workers have been employed recently, but with quite limited upgrading and career mobility. Equal promotion opportunities will require the complete dedication of management, with promotion from within, accompanied by the necessary training to  provide career opportunities for entry minority workers. Recommendations include: (1) establishing an internship program providing college tuition plus a salary for part time employment and full time summer employment, and (2) providing a variety of services such as day care, legal, and medical services for employees.

The \"Closed Loop Systems Approach to Instruction\" developed for this study was derived from the assimilation of the works and concepts of many professional vocational educators. In order to generate the data base to accomplish Phase I and II objectives, a survey instrument was developed and mailed to 287 electronics oriented firms in three large midwest metropolitan areas. In addition, seven personal interviews were conducted using the instrument as a medium for stimulating responses. Collected evidence demonstrates that the\"Systems Approach\" can: (1) identify the characteristics of employed electronic technicians, (2) identify tasks performed by electronic technicians and determine educational requirements, (3) identify needed skills, (4) assess student mastery of specific skills, (5) identify the best techniques for accomplishing performance objectives, and (6) assure a relevant curriculum. Additional studies in other institutions are recommended. The survey instrument and data tables are included. (GB)",

        "description":"In this study of black employment in the building trades in Connecticut, a state-wide survey was made of workers, students, apprentices, project directors, public officials, and union and trade association officers. The survey showed that even with an increase of nearly 50 percent since 1960, blacks still represent less than 7 percent of all construction workers, and few of those are in skilled trades. This has continued despite increasing shortages of skilled labor for two reasons: (1) With few blacks now employed, there are few who can pass on job information to other blacks, and (2) Many blacks are culturally disadvantaged, lacking the necessary competency at mathematics and science. Although manpower shortages are expected to continue for the next decade, there is little  possibility of increased black representation, at least for the next 5 years, because of the present shortage of blacks in the lengthy apprenticeship programs.

Questionnaires and interviews revealed the views of teachers, administrators, and students in 46 Mississippi secondary schools offering special needs programs in vocational education.

To study employment fluctuations, over 80 data tables are provided on details of construction activities, worker mobility, income, weather conditions, and employment distributions by age, race, skill, occupation, and sex. One conclusion of the report is that wage differentials favoring construction workers are due to less favorable working conditions, specifically irregular employment, hazardous work, greater mobility  requirements, and lower fringe benefits.

Additional research needed in the homemaking program area includes  the development of new methods of teaching, innovative instructional materials, evaluation techniques, model programs, the affective domain, and process of learning, while areas of teacher education needing further research include problems related to recruitment, counseling students, adaptation of modern technological devices, and ongoing research of programs, teachers, and materials.

The problems identified were: (1) Voters are more willing to support educational programs benefiting all students, and the costs of vocational education programs are often more expensive than a college preparatory or liberal arts course, (2) The federal and state assistance intended to be an incentive often becomes a ceiling because many school districts provide vocational programs only when they are reimbursed, (3) A tight definition of vocational education often becomes a straight jacket, (4) The state plan is not a  viable planning instrument, and (5) The Federal Government has little power to affect the achievement of national objectives. To alleviate these problems, the council recommends that a new technique in federal-state relationships be adopted in which a support component, comprising 75 percent of the funds, would come from Congress, and the remaining 25 percent would be an incentive component to be allocated by the Office of Education in proportion to each state's efforts to achieve the national objective.

Several procedures were established to accomplish project objectives, including methods for defining educational objectives, deriving course content, individualizing instruction, measuring student achievement, and evaluating program results. Despite several problems, especially budgetary limitations, Project ABLE has made major contributions in terms of potential national significance and application in the areas of individualized instruction, student  evaluation, and program evaluation. Before the effectiveness of the instruction can be demonstrated, all system components must be completed, a field test population of adequate size must be used, and a longitudinal study of an adequate number of graduates must be conducted.

This in-depth evaluation centered around the various projects and activities as identified by the Center's goals. Thus, these activities were primarily concerned with (1) increasing the accessibility of occupational education to the individual, (2) the effect of adult basic education on occupational adjustment and acculturation of low literature adults, (3) the development of postsecondary occupational education in the South. Other projects and activities included the application of a program planning and budgeting system to an educational research and development center and the development  of a model exemplary program in occupational education for the middle grades.

Leaders from labor, foundations, and professional organizations in education were invited also in order to gain their experience and points of view. The sense of what they said to each other is shown in quotation in the body of this report. The purpose of the meeting was exploratory rather than explanatory. The participants explored each other's aims and tried to find mutually acceptable objectives for education. Agreement did  not come often, and many questions went unanswered. The participants worked hard at identifying problems in education which seemed worthy of cooperative approaches. At the conclusion of the meeting, participants were asked to complete a two page evaluation form. The forms were color-coded so that the participants could remain anonymous but the returns could be classified according to industry, education and community. The results are summarized and tabulated in this report. (ON)",

The plan, developed mostly by professional educators from the district, was developed out of economic necessity and not primarily as an experiment. Under the plan, students in the district spend 45 school days in school and 15 school days out of school in each of four cycles. In order to have the school in continuous operation, only one fourth of the students are on vacation at any one time. Hence, the students are placed in four groups staggered  by 15-day periods.

Two experiments studied the effects of speech rate upon the comprehension of listening materials by high and low aptitude mean. Experiment 1 indicated that low aptitude men appeared to learn easy material better than difficult material as a function of decreased speech rate. High aptitude men appeared to learn materials best at around 175 words per minute, independent of difficulty.

A questionnaire containing 23 scale items was developed on the basis of interviews within the NCCCS and of a literature review on communication modes. Of the questionnaires sent, 336 (87%) were returned. Findings led to several conclusions: (1) modes should be stressed (especially textbooks, reference books, and consultations with coworkers) which instructors  used most often and considered most effective; (2) use nonwritten rather than written modes, and external rather than internal modes, whenever practical; (3) since college transfer, technical, and vocational instructors use information sources to increasing degrees, respectively, diffusion efforts should be geared accordingly; (4) comprehensive and technical institutions require different approaches only in the case of college transfer instructors.

The Kropp-Verner Evaluation Scale and a questionnaire were administered to participants. Of the total number of respondents, 56% were women, 67% were aged 35 or older, and 75% had less than three years of ABE teaching experience. Opinions on meeting space, relevance of program content, opportunities for participation, and personal improvement tended to be favorable. The workshop as a whole was likewise judged successful. Strong points most often mentioned were the quality of teaching, discussions on how to develop reading skills, and appropriateness of the ideas and materials presented. The lack of group discussion and  sufficient time in general was the only area of weakness noted. Mathematics emerged as the leading topic of concern for future workshops. (A questionnaire, evaluation instruments, reading passages, curriculum outlines, and other appendices, are included). (LY)",

Some of the subject areas are: orientation and induction; intake training; community resources; medical assistance; understanding and use of casework concepts; employment preparation and achievement; and differential use of the staff. Man hours of training per employee during the year ranged from none in four counties to 10.7 in one county. Forty-one percent of all training man hours received by ten percent of the trainees was devoted to  orientation and induction. Three fourths of the formal courses were designed for social workers; the next largest amount of training directed toward specific staff groups was provided for clerical staff.

The 12 week training program was divided into five units--home nursing (47 hours), home economics (62 hours), social work (47 hours), psychology (nine hours), child care (34 hours)--taught by professionals in their respective fields. Classes were held in seminar fashion, with emphasis on discussion and role playing, and liberal use of audiovisual aids. For financial and other reasons, only ten placements were made in the three months following training; but these were relatively long term. Although findings show that the more disadvantaged  women worked better as visiting homemakers, it was felt that with sound training, good supervision, and careful placement, other homemakers can also contribute to the rehabilitation of many families. It was recommended that an additional two weeks of classroom study in home economics, social work, and psychology be added, as well as more on the job training.

CRD personnel tended to be aged 35 to 54, with a graduate degree, little or no inservice training, and one or more professional associational memberships. Their reading was varied, headed by newspapers and Cooperative Extension publications. A majority had entered CRD from outside Cooperative Extension. Priorities appeared to be shifting from earlier concerns (mainly land use and outdoor recreation) to such problems as housing and  health. There was emphasis on engaging local people in studying community problems and acting on likely alternatives, with CRD persons providing guidance, information, and liaison. Field staffs tended to see themselves as problem-solving generalists, not specialists. A majority of respondents felt that various Federal, state, and local developmental agencies do try to work together on common problems. Eight items, including citizen participation in planning and development, emerged as important evaluation criteria. (LY)",

Consideration is given to the training problems arising where a comprehensive form of agreement containing a number of changes is introduced covering the entire workforce in a unit or factory. In order to establish a systematic approach for management contemplating the introduction of a comprehensive agreement, a typical plan of action is set out under the following steps: diagnosis of existing situation; definition of objectives; determination of the means of achieving objectives; drawing up  the detailed agreement; negotiation; implementation; and follow-up. The training needs arising at various levels are suggested at each major step. Six appendices are included: example of a short seminar for senior managers; course for senior managers on productivity agreements; course for shop stewards; suggested reading list; productivity agreement--consultative arrangements made by a firm negotiating agreement; and summary of training needs by categories of employees.

Few had known much about corrections before volunteering and the screening they received was shown not to be uniform.

Ten persons are studying for equivalency diplomas. Fifteen have expressed interest in other vocational areas, and suitable training centers are being sought. Persistence in therapy, academic and work performance, and certain other criteria seem  to favor those who have participated in the pilot programs. Numerous recommendations in such areas as public relations, course planning, and professional training, were formulated; and the Nassau County Drug Abuse and Addiction Commission has already taken steps to implement inhouse courses for Topic House patients and staff.

An objective was to find out if volunteer 4-H Club leaders felt qualified to conduct: (1) 4-H leader training, (2) planning with Extension, (3) recruiting members and leaders, and (4) organizing new leaders and 4-H Clubs. A questionnaire was mailed to all extension agents (101) and all 4-H leaders (617) in seven randomly selected counties. The questionnaires were different except for one part which asked for the amount of training needed by a county level leader. Extension agents returned 88 questionnaires; all were used. Four-H Leaders returned 325; 32 were  incomplete and not used. From the data collected, it appeared that Idaho Extension agents and 4-H leaders participating in the study had positive attitudes toward the county level leadership concept. A majority of the respondents agreed that volunteer 4-H leaders could assist Extension by assuming some of the organizational work currently being done by agents. (EB)",

        "description":"Discussed in this paper are reasons why people who speak second languages may not speak or write them with native-speaker-like fluency. These second-language deficiencies may be the results of (1) interference, the use of aspects of another language at a variety of levels; (2) strategies of learning such as over overgeneralization and analogy by means of which the learner tests out his hypotheses about the structure of the language; (3) strategies of assimilation, in which the learner makes his learning task easier; and (4) strategies of communication, whereby the learner adapts what he knows into an efficient communication model, producing an optimal utility grammar from what he knows of the language. In addition to understanding these deficiencies, it is necessary to  distinguish between performance and competence errors. The former are occasional and haphazard and are related to such factors as fatigue and memory limitations. The latter are systematic and may represent either a transitional stage in the development of a grammatical rule or the final stage of the speaker's knowledge. While knowledge about second language learning is still largely speculative, excluding the possibility of prescribing recipes for teachers, this account of errors and learning strategies may suggest some of the reasons for errors.

        "description":"The United States experience with bilingual schools falls into two periods: from 1840-1920 and from 1963 to the present. Bilingual schooling may be said to have originated in Cincinnati in 1840, where a large minority of the population was German-speaking. During this first period, perhaps a million American children received a part of their instruction in German as well as in English. Despite the extent and historical importance of this early bilingual schooling, however, it failed to provide an authoritative curriculum model for bilingual education. The bilingual program, often only a language program, was rarely integrated into either the philosophy or the practice of the school or society. Bilingual schooling disappeared from the U.S. scene from the time of World War I until  1963, when the Dade County bilingual program was initiated in Miami, Florida. A Ford Foundation grant provided for instruction in both English and Spanish for Spanish- and English-speaking children. Before the enactment of the Bilingual Education Act in 1968, the number of federally supported bilingual programs was probably less than 100; at present writing, there are 131 programs supported by federal grants. (In addition to discussing the contributions of various educators and linguists, the author includes an extensive bibliography of recent and forthcoming works.) (AMM)",

The tests used consisted of sentences which were either completely standard English or which contained phonological, morphological, or syntactical elements illustrating nonstandard speech influenced by Spanish. Only test items which were validated by at least 80% agreement in a group of 44 monolingual English-speaking students at the 12th-and 13th-grade levels were included in the tests. Subjects were asked to indicate whether they thought the utterances heard were completely standard (speech appropriate to formal school situations), or whether they contained nonstandard  features. Based on the test results, the suggestion is made that bilingual Spanish-speaking children who come from environments in which they are continuously exposed to nonstandard English influenced by Spanish should be offered special training consisting of the overt contrasting of standard and nonstandard grammar.

A small amount of new material is introduced at a time (usually in a monolog, drill, or dialog) which, after a brief bit of practice is used for communication (in a communication activity or a dialog). An introductory section presents a short description of the history of this form of Creole, considered the national language by many Mauritians, notes on the spelling, and suggestions to the student and the teacher for using the material. Appended are additional dialogs and a section on pronunciation to provide practice on some of the aspects of Mauritian Creole likely to prove  troublesome for American learners. An English-Mauritian Creole glossary concludes the text. (AMM)",

The common philosophical core that undergirds the entire counseling program was that the role of the  elementary counselor was that of a facilitator of the learning process; consequently, the central role of the teacher was constantly kept in mind. In order to assess the effects of the program, a descriptive model was utilized. At the conclusion of the program, after federal funds were no longer available, only two of the participating districts dropped elementary school counseling.

There are numerous difficulties involved in attempting to establish meaningful and effective community participation including program complexities, and interpersonal and staff complexities. It is suggested that to effectively approach problems associated with community participation and control, it is important to consider developmental processes in community participation. The mental health professional should begin by establishing contact with a small group of community people who have an interest in community based mental health services. This total group should then become involved in a process similar to the stages of a task oriented group. The community group should be  encouraged to move toward wider representation so that an adequate base can be established for active citizen participation. This organism can be strengthened and further developed through additional group process which emphasize: (1) availability-visibility; (2) flexibility; (3) openness; and (4) initiation of contact.

The game consists of three stages which correspond to the above objectives and represent an integrated instructional system in which pupils, counselors, and media components interact. In the first stage the pupil views video tapes which present a wide range of pupil behavior types in a group setting. The  second stage requires the pupil to analyze his observations by interrogating a computer system. In the final stage students meet with a counselor in a group discussion to evaluate the information they have individually acquired. They examine alternative solutions to the problem and a concensus is achieved through an exchange of various socio-cultural views held by the participants. Implications of such a system for elementary school counseling are discussed. (RSM)",

Being over-age in grade in 1966 and at least 17 in 1967 strongly increased the likelihood of dropping out of high school and this relationship affected blacks much more than whites. Among youth not over-age, low I.Q. and living in the West (whites) or South (blacks) increased the probability of premature withdrawal from school. A combination of relatively low educational aspirations, low family income, and low expenditures per pupil also increased the probability of dropping out of school. While blacks  constituted less than one-third of the sample, they were a majority in these disadvantaged categories. The educational expectations of seniors were strongly predictive of entrance to college. Expectations, in turn, were closely related to high school curriculum and mother's educational attainment. Despite low family incomes and relatively little education of many of their mothers youths with high I.Q.'s in these circumstances were more successful than average in moving into college. (Author)",

Conclusions include: (1) the effects of social origins on educational aspirations are indirect through the expectations/aspirations of parents,  teachers, and peers (in that order of importance); (2) these effects are more potent and more pervasive for girls; and (3) the role played by academic performance for girls in this process reflects a sex differential in the value placed on higher education.

A &quot;motivated&quot; group and an &quot;unmotivated&quot; group were thus identified. Using the Minnesota Division of Vocational Rehabilitation case closure, the results indicated that motivated clients were more frequently &quot;closed employed&quot; than unmotivated clients. Several demographic variables did not differentiate the two motivation groups, but the group judged unmotivated had a higher mean score on the Psychopathic deviate scale of the  Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory than did the motivated group. Discussion includes an examination of the case closure systems of private and public rehabilitation agencies and some consideration of agency administrative barriers which may promote client lack of motivation for rehabilitation services.

Six schools for pregnant students are described as multi-disciplined centers which allow the student to continue her full-time education with provision for special health and counseling needs. The Board of Education is viewed as responsible for educating even pregnant students. The objectives of the six schools, funded under Title I ESEA, include: (1) to improve attendance; (2) to increase the incidence of live births among pregnant students; (3) to increase infant care and homemaking skills; (4) to provide the girls with saleable skills; and (5) to change their academic profile. Administrative and operative details are  discussed.

        "description":"The research to be described includes two related investigations, one of which was a study of elementary school teachers' perceptions of fatherless boys. The second study involved an attempt to determine relative affects of male and female teachers on the social and emotional development of fatherless boys during the early elementary school years. Twenty-two fourth grade fatherless boys were studied in terms of various measures of social and emotional development. Eleven of these children were in the classrooms of male teachers during the course of an entire school year, while the remaining 11 were under the influence of female teachers. Results consistently favored the male teacher influence, with significantly higher ratings on overall social and emotional development for boys  in male teacher classrooms. Significantly higher scores were also obtained by the male teacher group in terms of the childrens' self confidence, feelings of self worth, and ability to accept responsibility. Findings tend to support the argument for the use of male teachers in the elementary grades. (Author/SFK)",

The prime objective of the project was to gather baseline data on freshmen entering Central States colleges so that the changes occurring in their attitudes and opinions during college and after could be studied longitudinally. At the outset of the project it was learned that the colleges had not been gathering similar student data and were not using standardized information gathering instruments. The College Student Questionnaires and the Omnibus Personality Inventory were selected to gather baseline information on all entering freshmen of fall 1969. In addition a random sample of 50 freshmen at each  college was interviewed in depth on the basis of a standard protocol and was rated by the interviewer on a standard form covering interests, attitudes, and personality characteristics. A secondary objective was to encourage institutional research among faculty members of Central States colleges by publicizing opportunities and underwriting promising small studies. The project demonstrated the value of institutional research to member institutions and established it as a regular function of the colleges and the consortium. (Author/SFK)",

It also provides data on the test results of the pupils in schools having such testing programs. The scope of this study is limited to the extent to which schools have implemented the basic recommendations of the President's Council on Physical Fitness. These recommendations focus on health appraisals and on physical activity and testing programs in schools. Such programs are designed to contribute to the development of strength, endurance,  flexibility, and other physical qualities necessary for good health and better living. Nearly all schools were found to provide physical education programs at some grade level and 48% of the schools were found to use a standardized test to measure selected physical abilities of some of their students.

One school of thought views education as separate from political concerns and maintains that schools should relate to the community only on particular issues about which decisions must be made. The more prevalent viewpoint studies schools within a political context and observes processes of decisionmaking to see how schools are run. Participants in school-community relations include school boards, superintendents, influentials, and citizens. Settings have become important as researchers adopt the viewpoint that school-community relations  should be examined within their societal contexts. Unfortunately, the relative newness of research in school-community relations has caused a divergence of research methods, and the consequent generalizations lack unanimity. (Author/JF)",

Four aspects of structure were studied: degree of departmentalization, school enrollment, student-teacher ratio, and extent of the administrative hierarchy. The norm of universalism was operationalized both for personal nonschool situations and for situations in the adult world. The data were collected from questionnaire responses of 1,400 6th grade students in 30 urban schools. For students who rejected universalism for personal nonschool situations, the data analysis revealed a positive relationship between the size of the school enrollment and the extent  to which students endorsed the norm of universalism for situations in the adult world.

As a result of this departure from tradition, many values and practices that have characterized education in industrialized society will be questioned.

Historical methods were utilized in examining the problem. As interest groups seek their objectives, they attempt to reduce conflicts of the party, the legislature, and the governor within the legislative process on particular issues. The study demonstrated that the rise of a strong executive branch to dominate the legislature reduced conflict in government as well as the number of viable points of access to the policy process available to interest groups. The ability of the governor to maintain controlled conflict will determine if education  groups develop competitive or coalitional behavior. (Author)",

This speech describes educational decisions in the State of New York as affected by local decentralization and by concentration of power at the State level. Relevant to this condition, educational theorists have advanced the idea that some form of regional instrument should be developed in New York metropolitan areas to provide school services planning for elementary and secondary education. The achievement of such a structure depends on citizen recognition of the value of regionalism as an approach to educational policy. (MLF)",

The Indianapolis Public Schools categorized teachers as (1) those reassigned to another teaching faculty, (2) those already under contract who volunteered to be transferred, and (3) teachers hired from outside the school district who were assigned to faculties for the purpose of achieving racial balance. Teacher morale in each group was measured and analyzed. The resulting data findings reveal that new teachers hired to achieve racial balance scored the lowest irrespective of race, and that black teachers scored higher than their white counterparts.

Recommendations were made that the administration should  assume more responsibility for the occupational placement of disabled pupils; the scope of the pre-vocational training program should be expanded to meet the changing labor market demands; and specific program objectives which pair specific skills with specific job opportunities based on employment situations of former pupils should be created.

Each was medically able to work full-time, though vocationally handicapped due to his disability, and had fewer than 12 years of schooling. An index of vocational achievement, constructed to measure ability to function in the work situation with maximum rewards, included measures of employment status, changes in salary, and changes in job level since placement. Results at followup showed the following factors associated with vocational achievement: sex (men more successful than women), age (young more successful), and socioeconomic status (upper class more successful). Disability factors  associated with achievement were onset of disability before age 45 and having a disability free from stigma. Work-related factors were interest in skilled manual jobs, high pay, avoiding formal job-seeking since placement, no specific job requirements when seeking last job, holding skilled manual positions, lengthy on-the-job training, and need to work as indicated by number of dependents.

Mental health was defined as the child's social functioning in home and school and as reflected in the child's self image; and it was hypothesized that the mental health of mildly physically handicapped children improved through recreational activities with their nonhandicapped peers. It was also speculated that no special or additional staff would be needed. Data was obtained through interviews with the children, families, teachers, group leaders, and placement counselors. Researchers felt that, after comparing factors concerning the families, the school and the children's self  evaluations, the children showed improvement attributed to associating with their nonhandicapped peers. The second hypothesis concerning staffing was not confirmed. Recommendations for community centers, schools, and adult education to benefit the mental health of physically handicapped children were made. (CD)",

From the responses to this number of referents task, a concept usage task was constructed which required choosing the three, of five, pictures that went together on a given card (one card per concept) as well as giving a verbal label for the concept. Results indicated that there were no significant differences between the groups on abstraction ability, on any of three measures from the number or referents task, or on the number of items correctly chosen in the concept usage task. It was noted that non-retarded subjects did, however, appropriately  label significantly more of the concepts in the concept usage task.

The first portion of the report is devoted to the project itself, involving four groups of 20 children each, while part two involves the evaluation. Out of the pool of 80 children, 20 participants were identified for the sample. The evaluation rested primarily on the implementation of a structured schema, an adaptation of the Symptom Checklist, and availability of clinical case records maintained by the consulting psychiatrist and the teachers. Data was noted to suggest that the children learned to cope better, to interact more appropriately with their environment, and to function at a higher cognitive level than previously  had been the case. The therapeutic nursery group approach was felt to be particularly effective for those children whose emotional problems were not severe enough to preclude their involvement in a day care center, yet whose problems were such that a maximum growth and development was likely to occur only if specialized therapeutic attention was made available.

Twenty-four of the 40 persons receiving intensive mobility training were considered rehabilitated during the project. It is noted that the project probably influenced the school systems involved (Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, Maryland) in their decisions to employ mobility specialists for blind students, and that the Maryland Division of Vocational Rehabilitation also incorporated the position of mobility instructor in its program of services to the blind. Several typical case summaries are presented as examples of the work accomplished in the project. It  is concluded that, while no really new or unusually significant results emerged from the study, the recognition and acceptance of mobility as an area needing special attention constitutes a worthwhile achievement.

Forty were multiply handicapped while the majority were underachievers. The program was viewed as only desirable to a degree due to a lack of specialized staff and too little individual instruction in vocational skills. During the 3 years, 57 students completed training while 46 terminated before completion; 85% of the total were judged to have made worthwhile personal, social, and vocational gains, but most did not appear to benefit to the extent of their capabilities. Services for the deaf were considered feasible for the length of the study, but questions  were raised concerning permanent continuation. The deaf were often short-changed as a result of communication difficulties. Additional data and conclusions are presented. (RJ)",

A dexterity test and a mirror drawing of a six-pointed star were administered, the latter in a stress-producing manner. Learning potential status mainly predicted the rate of learning on the motor task. The hypothesis that highscorers and gainers would cope more adequately with stress than nongainers was somewhat supported. Nongainers showed an initial appearance of adequacy which they were unable to maintain. One conclusion is that there is great heterogeneity of performance among identified educable retardates. (RJ)",

A group of 45 students were enrolled in a standard 3-month mobility training program. Each student suffered a postural problem, some compounded by severe orthopedic and/or neurological deficit. All subjects were given complete orthopedic and neurological examinations as well as a battery of special psychometric tests. Postural problems were diagnosed and treated by a variety of therapeutic techniques, some newly described, including specialized exercise, splintage, and postural physical education programs. Improvement evaluation (by motion picture photography) was made before, during and after the 3-month program. The hypothesis tested was that improvement in posture contributed  to improvement in mobility. The final results indicated such a correlation to exist. One implication is that postural training plays an important role in the development of mobility skills and thus in the total rehabilitation of the blind. (Author)",

Modification of the GATB consisted of eliminating answer sheets, increasing practice, individual administration, untimed administration, removal of verbally loaded items, and simplifying test instructions and practice problems. None of these modifications significantly changed the test performance of the mentally retarded subjects. Modification of the MIQ involved rewriting the item stems at a readability level which was understandable to mentally retarded individuals. Form S, the revised 17-scale MIQ, was found equivalent to the standard MIQ in terms of profile similarity and, for 11 of 17 scales,  equivalent means and standard deviations. Individual differences in measured abilities and needs among the mentally retarded were found to approximate those of the non-mentally retarded. Applicability of the Theory of Work Adjustment, utilizing the GATB and Form S MIQ in assessing work personalities, is indicated for mentally retarded individuals in the borderline and, to a lesser extent, the mild categories.

Implementation of the training model consisted of administering the materials to 23 new staff members of different state education agencies during a 2-week workshop. Evaluation  instruments included interviews with subjects, completion of a written opinionnaire by subjects following the workshop, and administration of the Trial Problem Solving Exercise to measure growth of skill in information processing, sensitivity to issues, and organizing and planning.

The research program, part of the Primary Education Project (PEP), is an attempt to develop a systematic method of specifying and validating learning hierarchies so that instructional programs can be designed which provide an optimal match for a child's natural sequence of acquisition. An operational definition of the number concept is proposed in the form of a set of eight behavioral objectives which, taken together, permit the inference that the child has an abstract concept of \"number.\" Each behavioral objective is analyzed to identify both its component behaviors or skills and the  prerequisite behaviors necessary for learning those components. Specific sequences of learning objectives are then proposed which are hypothesized to facilitate optimal learning by maximizing transfer from earlier to later objectives. A formalized \"mastery\" model is described in which children are tested to determine their entering level in the curriculum and are then passed on to higher level objectives on the basis of their demonstrated mastery of lower level ones.

A total of 11,538 telephone interviews were completed between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. during one week of November 1970. Respondents were asked if they had a television set and what program they were watching. Certain respondents were asked further questions concerning their age, educational background, opinion of the station and its programming, and their general television viewing habits. The results of the survey are presented at length in both expository and tabular form.  Results include evidence that there has been a 20.6% growth in weekly circulation since 1966, that KQED now attracts an audience with a much younger age profile, and that the fragmentation of the station's audience into groups interested in particular kinds of programming is striking. Children's programs, educational programs, and news or public affairs programs stand out as KQED's greatest strengths. Survey design, sampling techniques, material design, interviewer training, and analysis methods used in the survey are discussed in great detail. (JY)",

The audio portion pointed out relationships in the exhibit and directed a visitor's attention, as well as confirmed his answers to the punchboard questions. Some visitors used the audio cassette alone, and some just viewed the exhibit. The effectiveness of these devices was evaluated by means of pre- and posttests given on a gamelike test machine. One unexpected result was that while the cassette punchboard system improved learning, so did simply taking a pretest before viewing the exhibit. This result led to the development and pilot testing of a \"recycling\" system which uses a gamelike, self-quiz machine that provides  criterion questions to help the player identify the concepts to be learned, scores his performance, and gives a free-play token for a good performance. The positive results gained from the use of these interactive devices supports the idea that substantive learning can occur in a public museum. Results also suggest several possibilities for using programed, interactive systems to evaluate and to improve the learning potential of museum exhibits and other public displays. (JY)",

The compilation of indices includes the Display-Evaluative Index, a set of panel lay-out indices, and a set of task-rating scales. Application of the indices proved feasible; differentiation among three training devices and within four trainee subtasks was possible. The predictive method which was then generated is an adaptation of the standard multiple regression model. Mean  task scores replace the usual individual criterion scores, and quantitative task index values are used as predictor scores. The adaptation was tested using data from published studies in tracking. Significant multiple correlations using task indices were found for criterion data obtained during the early stages of practice. A combination of task and training indices did predict later performance. This result supports the contention that a prescriptive method must include both training and task indices in order to account for advanced levels of proficiency. (Author/JY)",

Data analysis included a factor analysis of test items, a comparison of subgroup differences in stimuli response, an examination of the differences in types of  violence, and a check on relative perceptions of the control and experimental scenes. Boys from lower income families perceived violent scenes as more real and more acceptable, liked watching such scenes more, and liked watching all scenes more than middle class boys. Lower income blacks saw less violence in violent scenes than lower income whites; however, this may be an extension of the socio-economic difference, rather than a racial one.

In CITY III, the computer stores all the relevant statistics for the area, updates data when changes are made, and prints out yearly reports. The computer also simulates decision-makers, influences, and markets outside the local metropolitan area; performs certain routine procedures which would be time consuming for players; and acts as a bookkeeper, recording all the transactions of the players and balancing their financial accounts. At the beginning of the CITY III game, participants are divided into social and economic decision-makers. These decision-makers then elect the players who will perform the roles  of the governmental sector. After the players receive a report which explains the status of their various functions, they may begin to analyze their problems and formulate solutions. The player's manual presents the basic information for each decision-making sector. This information includes the numerical parameters for each sector as well as a description of the types of decisions that may be made. The manual describes the methods for inputing data to the computer and interpreting the computer output. A set of &quot;Master Sheets&quot; summarizes all the numerical parameters for four versions of CITY III. (JY)",

Estimates of resource costs, in dollar terms, incurred by graduate students in fulfilling the requirement are illustrated through frequent use of tables.

Some of the findings were: (1) there was strong agreement among the 3 groups that disruption by activists was inimical to academic freedom and  the educational process; (2) there was strong demand among students for greater participation in decisionmaking; (3) there was agreement that social change should be accomplished through the democratic process; (4) there were significant differences in attitudes held by younger and older faculty members and by faculty members in different disciplines; and (5) the existence of great diversity in American higher education.

The recommendations reflect this orientation. Section I of the report discusses the problems facing higher education, particularly student unrest and the causes of student frustration. Section II deals with the socioeconomic factors that determine how current needs are being served and what new demands may develop during the next decade. The  factors considered are: (1) population, including numbers, density, age, ethnic and racial characteristics, education and personal income; (2) economy, including projected manpower needs; and (3) accessibility to the state's institutions of higher education.

This interim report discusses some of the major findings from the field work. These findings include: (1) there is extensive general interest in the idea of national planning for higher education; (2) the most successful planning is carried out by some state coordinating agencies and regional organizations; (3) there is a great deal of planning by the institutions of higher learning, but the quality of  these efforts is uneven; (4) major federal programs affecting higher education are carried out in the absence of any coherent set of national policies or plans; (5) a serious handicap to long-range planning is the lack of available data on current needs and costs, and on alternative strategies; and (6) college officials are thwarted in their planning efforts by conflicting views on how to meet societal problems and cope with student unrest.

Twenty-one instructors from 14 junior colleges developed a scoring key that included 19 dichotomous criteria and learned to use it reliably. They collected pre- and post-compositions from students in their classes during the first and last week of the fall semester, and scored the compositions without their knowing the student's name, course level, institution, or whether the composition was a pre- or post-sample. Comparing class means, significant differences were found  between remedial and transfer groups and between pre- and post-test performance on item clusters relating to \"content\" and \"organization,\" but not on \"mechanics.\" The procedure was found to be feasible for use in departmental settings.

The hierarchical designations were compared for all subjects on the bases of role orientation, sex, age, and major field of interest or subject discipline. Role orientation (staff vs. student designation) was found to be statistically more significant than any of the other comparisons. Stemming from the results of this study, a proposed clustering of values has been devised for use in future research. Five constellations of values have been suggested: (1) the belief in rational or cognitive man versus the irrational; (2) the belief in a personal God, a somewhat structured Judeo-Christian belief system;  (3) the Protestant ethic--the notions that one must work for a living, give value for money received, be \"practical\" in orientation to life and work; (4) the concept of democracy, equal opportunity for all, and (5) the view of the person as an individual, having rights of his own, and stressing his individuality.

The second paper discusses verifiable objectives in terms of theories of instruction, management, and motivation. The third paper discusses a theory that allows for flexibility and stimulates autonomous decision making on the part of administrators, community, students, and faculty. The fourth article points out that, despite the \"open-door\" commitment of 2-year colleges, their curricula lead to a closed system of limited space, measured time, rigidity, and  narrowly fixed teaching procedures. The fifth article is a discussion of alternative enrollment-attendance patterns. Moving from the special focus on students to a proposal for faculty, students, and community people, the final article makes a strong plea for a radical redefinition of the school. (Author/CA)",

Israel already has 2-year post-secondary institutions, but the colleges and universities do not accept their students with advanced standing. Urgently needed are adult, continuing, and compensatory education programs. From his evaluation, the author concludes that: (1) emphasis in curriculum should be in technical fields, which are vital to the nation's interests; (2) a need exists for the education of more qualified teachers; (3) of critical importance are accreditation and the need to provide advanced standing to academically qualified  students when they are transferring to 4-year colleges and universities; and (4) these problems should be corrected as soon as possible.

The frequency of citation of the three less-used types of publication: books, proceedings, and theses are very similar, whether they are cited by journal articles or reports. No trend toward citation of a more informal precedent literature, such as personal communications and memoranda, was discernable. In the information science literature, 80% of the citations are less than five years old. Both journal articles and reports  cite literature that, on the average, is less than two years old, indicating that reports and journal articles are equally up-to-date at the time of their publication. When the age distribution of the citations in journal articles is grouped by type of publication, the order of increasing age is: reports and proceedings (the same), journals, and books. In reports, cited reports, proceedings, and journal articles are of equal age, but cited books are older. (Author/NH)",

This study traced the prepublication dissemination of the main content of the article, from the beginning of work by the author to the time of publication. In Part I, the following topics are discussed in detail: (1) background characteristics of the authors, (2) prepublication schedule of the work  published, (3) scope and effect of prepublication reports, (4) submission of manuscripts to journals, (5) continuity of work in geography, and (6) availability of information contained in the journal article from secondary sources. The main body of the report deals with general findings, while each of the appendices deals with more detailed comparisons such as American and foreign authors (Appendix A) and articles published in the journals studied (Appendix B). The second study reported deals with the group of persons whom the authors in the journals studied cited as conducting work in the same subject-matter areas as those of their own articles. (NH)",

A survey of public libraries in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin was conducted by questionnaire to identify commonly accepted goals, objectives, and activities. The results of the survey were synthesized with the information produced by a background study in the areas of library objectives and PPBS. It was concluded that (1) the major library objectives reported in the literature are, in fact, the ones recognized by most public libraries, (2) library objectives are extremely difficult to categorize precisely, (3) a structure is needed for the meaningful presentation of goals, objectives, and activities, and (4) the philosophy underlying a PPBS is  applicable to library management. As many of the associated techniques as possible should be used, but they should be perceived as information-producing supportive elements for the final human judgement or decision. (Author)",

The main broad impressions of the situation and trend in scientific and technical communication are: (1) The information problem is different from other problems of concern to the Office of Science and Technology (OST); (2) Fair progress is being made toward implementation of mechanisms to facilitate use of information; (3) The  Committee on Scientific and Technical Information (COSATI) is doing almost all that can be done by a committee representing diverse agencies; (4) The government is only partially successful in getting non-government cooperation from a unified information system; (5) The demand for a unified system is increasing progressively from some quarters; (6) The field is not yet well enough defined to justify a national system attempt, and (7) The situation calls for a coherent plan and strong leadership. (This is considered to be one of the basic papers of government interest in the field of information science.) (Author/NH)",

To some extent, the issues underlying the concerns of these groups can be summarized as a question: How can an academic library achieve full benefit from microform media? To develop information and to probe the difficulties of managing and using library microforms, a conference was held at the University of Denver in December 1970. The overall perspective of the conference treated the library administrator as a mediator between competing interests and forces that are operative in the sphere of academic microform applications. The purposes of the meeting were to foster understanding and use of microform technology in academic libraries, enhance the utility of  educational microforms through the exchange of ideas, and inform the academic library community and industrial sector of microform techniques, systems and requirements in an academic setting. Taken as a whole, this document reports constructive comment for the development of more effective microform utilization in the academic environment in differing situations. (Author/SG)",

Each year, many professionally trained recruits go into the field of library service with only the most rudimentary notion of, and training for community, group, and power-structure analyses. Library educational services, historically, have given little formal attention to any training for the &quot;floating&quot; community librarian nor to developing the ability to use the methods of community development education for the broad informational and educational purposes of actual and potential patrons in the community neighborhoods. Four models of community communication services are the &quot;outreach project&quot; for reaching users outside of the main  building, community involvement, community work beyond regular library hours and the role of the independent information specialist who works outside of the confines of institutional support. The role of the professional person is to stimulate the articulation of community needs and interests and involve citizens in decision-making processes, for which a major method is provided.

The Center provides Selective Dissemination of Information services to academic, industrial and research organizations from chemical and biological data bases, using computer programs developed during the first year of the project. This paper discusses the preparation of those programs as it relates to the programming language, PL/1. The paper indicates that PL/1 is admirably suited to the needs of a system designed for search of bibliographic data bases. The most outstanding features of PL/1 in this regard are its flexibility, I/O capability and ease of  programming, modification and documentation. The use of PL/1 has given an opportunity to do more true system research and development in less time than machine or assembly code would have, and also has been better for this type of work than other compiler languages. The use of PL/1 allowed development of a better overall system in terms of features and efficiency than could have been obtained by any other methodology. (Author)",

The first paper: &quot;A Prototype On-Line Document Retrieval System&quot; by D. Williamson and R. Williamson outlines a design for a SMART on-line document retrieval system using console initiated search and retrieval procedures. The conversational system is described as well as the program organization. The second paper: &quot;Template Analysis in a Conversational System&quot; by S. F. Weiss discusses natural language conversational systems. The use of natural language makes possible the implementation of a natural dialogue system, and renders the system available to a wide range of users. A set of goals for such a system is  presented. An experimental conversational system is implemented using a template analysis process. A detailed discussion of both user and system performance is presented.

        "description":"The objective of the investigation was to develop and test procedures for training children in coordination of projective space. (Projective concepts involve apparent distance, relative position, shape of figures, and other topological factors. A person with a command of projective space sees objects as a coordinated system of figures in space.) A total of 36 8-year-old middle class children who could not coordinate projective space were trained in a carefully sequenced instructional program embodying heirarchies based on Piagetian theory as one dimension, Brunerian modes of representation as a second, and complexity of task as the third. Gains in ability to coordinate projective space, as measured by the Perspective Ability Test developed by the senior author, exceeded those of  a control group. There were no significant differences between performance gains of males and females. It is recommended that previous studies that suggested Piaget's normative process is immutable--and that basic cognitive development cannot be enhanced significantly through instruction--be reevaluated in terms of theoretical deficiencies, inappropriate methodology, measurement problems, and other factors. The possibility of successful training on other spatial tasks and with younger children should be considered. Appendixes provide statistical data, training lessons, and explanations of Piagetian theory. (Authors/DR)",

The author provides an extensive review of the literature and trends of research in this area noting that the current volumes of knowledge in this area are not yet dependable enough to provide reliable bases for practice. He notes that among the problems presented in the study of infants are (1) availability of subjects in natural environment, and (2) the lack of reliable measures for research. Provided is an enumeration, explanation and evaluation of kinds of studies and known information about infant development. Included are longitudinal studies, cross-sectional studies, and assessments of direct and indirect evidence. The author feels that  practitioners should demand and support the production of more dependable knowledge by sponsoring field and basic research throughout infancy on the whole infant (rather than on his separate behaviors) as he functions in real life. White admonishes practitioners to accept the fact that, for the time being, child-rearing practices must be designed on an admitted best guess basis. An extensive bibliography is provided.

The main victims are 1- to 6-year-olds living in areas where deteriorating housing prevails. Among the causes of lead poisoning are: ingestion of lead-base paint, inhalation of fumes when leaded battery casings are burned for fuel, and ingestion of home-grown vegetables grown in soil containing leaded battery casings. Lead poisoning associated with pica, the craving for unnatural foods, is a chronic process requiring from 3 to 6 months of steady lead ingestion. Even though the early symptoms are nonspecific--anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, anemia--an increased  awareness of the problem by physicians and other health workers can lead to early detection. The public is poorly informed and even parents of children once striken are unaware of the high rates of recurrence and of occurrence in siblings. Control and prevention involve professional and public education, legislation, research, and improved housing. (AJ)",

The children were observed and filmed in semi-structured play sessions, primarily with family dolls, doll furniture, and small baby bottle. Instruments used were: (1) the Play Session Behavior Scale, which includes 22 variables defining organization, involvement, and interpersonal responsiveness in play, and (2) the Psychosexual Content of Play Scale, which includes 13 variables defining the amount of content reflecting each of the five early psychosexual stages of development. It is concluded that: (a) Effective functioning as a learner at age 4 requires skills which became crystallized during the Anal  Retentive stage, such as the ability to persist in tasks, take pleasure in accomplishments, and look for rules and order; and (b) Optimal functioning as a learner at age 4 is facilitated by skills arising out of the Phallic stage, such as curiosity, self-assertion, and an emerging sense of where one fits in the social order.

The teacher uses the professional response when she responds to a child in such a way as to invite him to recall previous experiences and to predict in terms of these, to categorize, to think about his response, to become descriptive and specific, and to strengthen the meaning that words and phrases have for him. Teachers and aides are trained to utilize (1) reinforcement, (2) individualization, (3) modeling, and (4) orchestration (identifying skills to evolve out of activity) in harmony with the philosophy and organization of TEEM. Basic to development of the professional response is a teacher's ability to  pick up cues from the total classroom environment. The teacher must listen to pupils so that she will keep the environment in tune with their interests and development. Two TEEM checklists for teacher self-evaluation are appended to this theoretical model of the teacher's role in teacher-pupil interactions. Both checklists may help teachers to develop their own style of professional response. (WY)",

An instructional sequence of 10-minute lessons was presented on alternate days over a 3 1/2 week period by preservice elementary education majors to 93 children 3-5 years of age. Instructions to the teacher consisted of ten typed lesson plans which permitted flexibility in wording and phrasing but were structured in terms of specific tasks and experiences. Children in the experimental group were subdivided into smaller, homogeneous groups of 4-6 children for training. A control group was exposed to an enriched environment but received no training. Results  showed significant gains for the experimental group in 15 of the 18 criterion subtests and significant interaction between chronological age (CA), mental age (MA), and intelligence quotient (IQ) levels. An analysis for retention showed no extinction. Instruction appeared to be effective for students above the 3-year-old level in MA and CA, and for IQ levels above 65. When disadvantaged children were compared with advantaged children of the same MA level, or of the same IQ level, significant differences appeared. (WY)",

The subjects were observed while attending a summer program prior to entering grades one through three. Observers rated each pupil on specific behaviors associated with egocentricity and decentration, as well as for positive-negative affect and verbal-nonverbal behavior. Identifying the underlying structure of the interrelationships of the decentering, verbal, and positive in addition to the remaining 27 variables was accomplished through a factor analysis. The decentering measures resulted in large loadings; verbal and positive variables loaded  heavily on conformity. Results define and stress the decentering factor as an independent variable having very little interaction on the remaining cognitive variables. It appears that neither cognitive nor social variables are prominently involved with decentering; however, stage by stage comparisons show that this is a finding peculiar to the level of development assessed. While this study affords no assessment of the dividing line between egocentric and decentering behavior, it provides baseline data from which other studies may be carried out.

        "description":"Why do American infants have a greater amount of vocalization, and particularly of happy vocalization, than do Japanese infants? To answer this question, 30 Japanese and 30 American first-born, 3- to 4-month old infants equally divided by sex, and living in intact middle class urban families were observed in their homes on two consecutive days during 1961-1964. Two specific styles of child care were shown to be at work influencing the process by which learning of cultural expectations for behavior comes about. American mothers were busier, livelier, and differentiated in their response to their baby's happy or unhappy vocalizations. The Japanese mother's pace was more leisurely. She was more attentive to the baby when he was going to sleep or waking up and less responsive to  vocalization in general. Apparently, these differences in maternal style of child care elicit behaviors from infants that are in line with later expectancies for behavior in the two cultures. A followup study of the first 20 of these same children in each culture as they became 2 1/2 and 6 years of age is being completed. It is expected that the early differences in behavior seen in infancy will continue along the lines laid down by the two cultures.

        "description":"Presents the evolution of participation programs for Head Start parents which were conducted by the University of Hawaii Center for Research in Early Childhood Education from 1967-1968 through 1970. Each year's shifting emphasis was based on experience with programs tried earlier, on shifting interests of staff and particular communities involved in other aspects of the year's research program, and on aspects of the overall research design of that year. Programs of group meetings and individual home visits were explored. Various types of parent participation programs in conjunction with curricular modules in the cognitive and motivational realms were assessed. The major conclusion is that broad generalization is not possible from small and short term attempts to alter parental  attitudes and practices. Parent programs may not be the most effective way to improve cognitive abilities and behavior of preschool children. (Author/WY)",

A total of 96 subjects (49 kindergarten and 47 first grade children) were chosen from the local public school population. Trained examiners administered the specially developed Knowledge of Terms Test and the Conservation of Length Relations Test (CLRT) individually to the children. On the basis of CLRT scores, subjects were classified as being high, medium, or low in conservation ability. CLRT materials were red, green, and blue sticks,  soda straws, and pipe cleaners which the children judged and compared for equivalence in length. Results indicate (1) children in both grade levels and in all three conservation levels were able to use the transitive property in the neutral situation in many more instances than in either the screening or conflict situation and (2) first grade children significantly outperformed the kindergarten children.

The program was designed to facilitate infants' cognitive, personality, and social development through personalized adult-child interaction, guided learning situations, free play and specialized care. Parent guidance, training of high school students as infant caretaker-teachers, and teacher inservice education were also project components. Infants in the program made significant gains over the first year in mental, social, and language development, especially for younger versus older infants compared with exclusively home-reared controls. Subsamples of  advantaged infants showed mean test gains of 30 to 40 points over 17 months and disadvantaged infants 30 points over 13 months. Other measures of socioemotional and cognitive development and measures of student and parent functioning showed generally positive results. This paper is a more complete report of ED 041 632.

The two hypotheses tested were: (1) parents participating in the encounters will evidence more direct concern for their children's preschool education and more favorable attitudes toward Head Start than those not attending such meetings; and (2) that the children of parents participating will score higher on tests of language performance and information acquisition than children of parents not attending. The study included two Head Start classes involving 30 black, Mexican-American, and Anglo children. The children were pretested and posttested with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Caldwell Preschool  Inventory and Situational Test of Competence (mid-measure). Parents were tested with Parents Expectations for Achievement of children in Head Start (PEACH), Parents Attitudes Toward Head Start (PATHS), and the &quot;How I Feel&quot; measure of alienation. Demographic data was also collected and parents and teachers completed the Situation Test of Competence as they expected the child to respond. Results of the study showed that only the second hypothesis tested was supported. (Author/AJ)",

During 1969-1970 the longitudinal study, begun in 1964, included 28 children who were 3- and 4-year-olds from lower socioeconomic homes characterized by use of dialect or primary speech of another language and lack of English fluency. To determine the effectiveness of an open, responsive environment in lessening the educational gap between advantaged and disadvantaged children, several projects were undertaken to extend and evaluate the work done in previous years. Through the use of a mobile instructional library, a home visitation program was continued which brought the New  Nursery School teaching strategies and related educational materials directly into the homes of the pupils. A small scale project to study the feasibility of a Spanish tutorial program for prekindergarten children was begun. A method of evaluating young children's comprehension of key grammatical elements was used, evaluated and revised. Results are discussed in terms of a comparative analysis of several testing measures. More than half of this document consists of tables and supplemental information. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The major objective of this study was to investigate differential performances among 5-year-old children when using transitivity of matching relations. Instruments were constructed to measure the subjects' (1) knowledge of matching relations, (2) ability to conserve the relations, and (3) proficiency in making inferences using the transitive property of the relations. Three specially designed tests, administered individually to 21 boys and 21 girls, assessed knowledge of relational terminology, level of conservation and performance on manipulative tasks (matching, comparing, judging quantitative relations among objects). A surprising result of this investigation was that subjects in the high category of conservation did not perform significantly better on transitivity than  subjects in the low category of conservation for each relation. In general, differential performance on transitivity between equivalence and order relational groups occurred only within the high conservation level. An extensive comparison is made between present results and Smedslund's (1963a) data for conservation and transitivity of discontinuous quantity. (WY)",

The study hypothesized that children receiving need for achievement (&quot;n&quot;-Ach) training would score higher on intelligence tests and evidence more of an increase in need for achievement, as measured by the Aronson Graphic Expressions, than children not receiving such training. The 84 black subjects, 46 boys and 38 girls, were divided into two &quot;n&quot;-Ach training groups and two control groups. All subjects were pretested with the Aronson Graphic Expressions design. &quot;N&quot;-Ach treatment for the experimental groups consisted of one hour of training each morning on Head Start school days for three months. The tasks of the  trainer were: (1) training in goal setting; (2) development of achievement language (&quot;I will try harder,&quot;&quot;I did it&quot;); (3) development of cognitive supports; and (4) development of group supports. Posttests given were the Standford Binet and Aronson Graphic Expressions. The tested IQ change occurred in the predicted direction but was not significant and there were no significant differences between the two groups in &quot;n&quot;-Ach.

To develop a positive reinforcement teaching style was the basic objective because it is both the most simple style to learn and the most powerful style for building success in learning. Role-play stimulation in small groups was the basic strategy for both the teachers' learning to teach parents and for parents learning to teach their children. Teachers were trained for three days on materials explaining program purpose, strategies, role-play experiences, and the kinds of sensitivity necessary to be effective teachers of parents. Each of these teachers trained three to five parents for 2 1/2 days. Next, the parents under direct supervision of the professional  teachers taught kindergarten age children in a Head Start summer program. Evaluations of the program were conducted utilizing: (1) analysis of audio-taped samples of parents' teaching, (2) written observations of parents' and teachers' training, (3) daily logs and interviews with teachers and supervisor. Eleven of the 12 parents increased their use of positive reinforcement. Eight of the 12 parents increased the variety of reinforcers used. Appendixes and tables included. (Author/AJ)",

The study attempted to discover whether the same children tested at intervals of one or more years showed similar development in thinking ability from age to age. Longitudinal test protocols were obtained for 92 children at 3 years who were retested at 5 years and 55 children at 4 years who were retested at 5 years, making 147 children included for tests at the 5-year level. A questionnaire covering the environmental influence in the life of the 5-year-old was asked of each mother. Questionnaire results were analyzed to see what relationships to children's thinking ability could be found. Factor patterns were compared across the three age levels. Results indicate  that five specific sorts of thinking ability can be identified. In general, the patterns of thinking shown by preschool children are retained throughout the three year age range. However, the pattern of development of each child varies not only in general rate of change but also for each aptitude. One clear implication of this study is that assignment to a \"track\" results in a great waste of potential because individual rates of development and different aptitudes vary so greatly from year to year.

Head Start and non-Head-Start pupils were evaluated at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade levels in terms of objectives related to behavior change through value modification, developing a rational value system through nonverbal experiences, language fluency development, improved muscular coordination and sensory discrimination improvement, and nonverbal emphasis on self-concept improvement. With  the application of various measurement techniques (including both locally originated and standardized instruments), it was found that Project ERA requires at least 3 years before the learning disadvantages of rural, poor Appalachian children can be overcome.

        "description":"It is reported that the New York State Indians, descendants of Asiatic immigrants, participated in leading cultural episodes of the eastern United States. Since their remains illustrate processes of cultural growth, the New York prehistoric cultures are described in terms of archaeological findings under 3 major stages of development: the Paleo-Indian stage, various Archaic cultures, and various Woodland cultures. In summary, it is noted (1) that the Paelo-Indian stage refers to the period of occupation by early hunters whose skeletal remains have never been found but whose scanty chipped stone implements occur on a few small sites in New York State is thinly scattered surface findings; (2) that, during the Archaic stage, groups of nonagricultural hunters, fishers, and gatherers  of wild food inhabited most of the state; and (3) that some of their descendants became pottery users and later agriculturists during the Woodland stage, which lasted into historic times.

During 1968-69, a coordinator and 4 field representatives contacted 162,769 persons (including group presentations). Referrals (777) received during the year were principally from school personnel and the Welfare Department personnel. When referred, 60% were high school students; 23% were high school graduates; 8.5% were high school dropouts; and 8.5% comprised the remainder of the referrals. Although student action in the fall is difficult to predict, it is estimated that 33% will enroll in college, 7.5% will attend vocational-technical schools, and 7.5% will take miscellaneous action.

Archeology dates man's arrival in North America further and further back. This suggests that the earliest arrivals moved north along the Asiatic littoral, east by way of the Koryak corridor, and pushed into Alaska perhaps 40,000 years ago. Time and the new environments helped to differentiate 3 contemporary cultures in the 3 different environments in the western America of some 12,000 to 10,000 years ago: the bison hunters, the basketmakers, and the millers. After agriculture was developed in Mexico about 5000 B.C., the  agricultural arts were diffused both north and south. By the time Europeans arrived, hunters of bison lived on the Great Plains, farmers lived in Mexico and the American Southwest, and groups who supplemented their agriculture by hunting lived in the East. Finally, at present, Indians have reached a stage of disadvantagement, the aspects of which can be taught at all levels of the school program. (LS)",

        "description":"A recent trend in American economic life has been the location of industrial complexes in traditionally rural areas. When this occurs, there are often accompanying rapid and sometimes traumatic changes in the rural community. These changes, in part, result from investment of new and massive amounts of capital, new employment opportunities, in-migration of new workers, and demands for new and more services. New values, attitudes, and patterns of behavior are introduced, and the established patterns of community life are disrupted. The basic trends of development in the social system of an experimental and control area are being studied in terms of the Jones-Laughlin Steel Corporation (J&L), which in 1965 began the development of a major production complex in the Hennepin area of  Putnam County, Illinois. The impact of the J&L installation is being explored by an interdisciplinary team of social scientists at the University of Illinois. The study project, known as the Rural Industrial Development Project, will investigate the impact of the installation in adjacent counties as well. The document includes an explanation of the theoretical framework of the study and 59 tables. (EJ)",

Specifically, the study investigated differences and/or similarities in the value-clusters of 3 groups of boys (50 in each group) of similar ages, intelligence, and socioeconomic status, differing only in reading achievement and/or in ethnicity. Among the conclusions drawn from the study were  that (1) significant differences in self-concepts, values, and role conceptions exist between Mexican American and Anglo American boys; (2) underachieving Mexican American boys do not perceive themselves as more negative than their better-achieving peers; and (3) Mexican American boys do not have lower occupational aspirations than Anglo American boys.

Data--obtained from student, parent, teacher, and community leader interviews and teacher questionnaires--were analyzed using rating scales. Only 1 of 4 Indian students appeared to be very interested in school; others evinced mild interest to general disinterest. Parents appeared to be more concerned about education of their children.  Teachers varied widely in their attitudes toward Indians, but many teachers seemed to feel that Indian students were not well motivated to succeed in academic work. Less than 5% of the teachers felt negatively about teaching Indian children. Interaction between the Indian community and the school was not great. The general opinion of most community leaders was that the Indian communities had little meaningful voice in the school. Most community leaders favored increase in local community control of schools. Parents and teachers were poorly informed about each other and each other's institutions, making it more difficult for schools to serve the Indian community and for Indians to influence the school.

Many workers were employed in only 1 activity or quit before its completion, but most completed 1 or 2 activities. Although most of the migrant labor in Michigan originated in 3 states (Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, in that order), 28 other states and Puerto Rico contributed to the migrant pool. All Michigan areas with agricultural labor had day-care centers and educational programs for children 3 months through 15 years. Basic education for adult migrants was offered at 2 skill centers operated as part of a coordinated  Manpower Development Training program. All Michigan areas with significant migrant concentrations had programs to provide some health services, most often in the form of health clinics operated by county health departments. Public agencies and private organizations were involved in providing welfare assistance to the migrants. These welfare activities ranged from providing food and clothing to assisting in securing housing for those settling out of the migrant stream. With 9 other states, Michigan participated in the Texas Migrant Experimental and Demonstration Project to determine the manpower and supportive services needed to improve employability of selected groups and to enhance their earning power and living standards.

School mechanisms have developed which tend to support ethnic isolation, perpetuate stereotyping and other myths, and in manifold ways differentially treat minorities. School segregation, ability grouping, student fees, and curricular or extracurricular offerings with middle-class-based grade, academic, or behavioral requirements for participation are examples of such mechanisms. The majority of Southwesterners rationalize the Mexican American subordinate social situation in simplistic and false terms. By stereotyping the Mexican American or by omitting his history, discrimination is perpetuated. Any school practice which discourages or impedes vertical mobility perpetuates low social  status of the poor. Such practices damage the life chances of the many poor of Mexican descent. To maintain minority groups in subordinate social and economic positions is detrimental to the national welfare. Economic poverty and powerlessness go hand in hand, each affecting the other and influencing the individual's world view, personality, and behavior. Educators can compensate for powerlessness by becoming advocates for the poor or by encouraging equal status interaction and participation and by sharing decision-making powers. (JH)",

Major findings were (1) that place of residence makes less difference in the selection patterns than does sex; (2) that males and nonmetropolitan females select glamour figures more than any other type of reference individual, including parents; (3) that metropolitan males have a more diverse selection pattern than do nonmetropolitan males; (4) that males choose glamour figures substantially more than do females; and (5) that socioeconomic status controls did not alter the selection patterns: (a) place of residence differences by sex on such  patterns are similar with or without the controls, and (b) sex differences by place of residence on such patterns are not only similar with or without the controls but make 2 of the patterns more pronounced. Implications of the findings for future research are made. (Author)",

        "description":"Adjustment problems of teachers in rural Alaskan schools stem from excesses in the physical elements and from the emotional and intellectual drain of encountering virtual isolation and cultural unfamiliarity. As a result, teacher turnover is a major obstacle to providing quality educational opportunity in rural schools. This research study attempted to determine (1) if some personal characteristics are predictive of attrition of teaching couples, (2) if quality differences exist in relation to a teacher's length of service in rural Alaskan schools, and (3) if participation in the Alaska Rural School Project (ARSP) summer institute is associated with curtailed rates of teacher attrition. Instruments used in the study were the Miller Analogies Test, the Minnesota Teacher Attitude  Inventory, and an ARSP-developed Biographical Information Inventory. Among the findings, it was noted that (1) teachers with few college credits are more prone to attrition than those with many college credits, (2) attrition-proneness is greatest in teachers hired with little or no formal training in education, (3) teachers staying for 2 years are estimated to be of the highest quality, (4) no consistent quality differences are found between teachers leaving after 1 year and those staying 3 years or longer, and (5) preservice training such as is encountered in the ARSP can likely reduce premature attrition by as much as 13%.

        "description":"In this report on a state-Federal program designed to help solve the problems of the migrant population in Accomack County, Virginia, it is estimated that, by early July of every year, almost 10,000 migrant adults and children establish temporary residence in the counties of Accomack and Northampton on Virginia's eastern shore. As noted, the program--which began in 1966 in the Accomack County Public Schools--served almost 500 children (migrant and disadvantaged nonmigrant) between the ages of 2 and 17 in the summer of 1970. Thus, there is flexibility in the instructional program for the 3 levels of children served (preschool, those ready for primary level, and older children who have been subjected to the basic skills), and nongrading and classroom instruction are geared to  individual levels of learning. In the report, the objectives and a general discussion of program services are given, along with evaluative conclusions and recommendations. Photographs of children and personnel engaged in program activities are included, and statistics on student enrollment and program personnel conclude the document. (EL)",

The primary objectives were to improve health and nutrition, to replace traditional approaches with an enlightened curriculum, and to provide an enriched social and cultural environment. The &quot;Listen Look Learn&quot; System of beginning reading instruction was used to provide a more individualized approach to teaching reading and communication skills. Extended day classes were provided twice a week for further activities in language development and social adjustment. Two creative projects used in the 1970 summer program and continued in the regular school program were a musical drama project to  encourage expression, imagination, and self-confidence, and social dancing for upper-grade youth and parents to strengthen community relations and home-school relations. Cooperation between local organizations and the school resulted in the provision of health services, clothing, and gifts for the migrant children. (JH)",

The process of redistricting or reorganization is characterized by its complexity and inherent internal and community problems. If the decision is made to attempt consolidation, the prime responsibility for the design and implementation of a feasible plan falls with the superintendents and the local boards of education involved. Particular attention must be paid to sensitive issues and the communication established with the community at-large. An acceptable consolidation plan must contain at least the following  ingredients: complete definitions of unique constraints to the consolidation goal; the identification of needs, goals, and objectives; the establishment of procedures and strategies; the design of an evaluation subsystem and related criteria such as provision for feedback; a &quot;programed&quot; planning model (time-lines, flowcharts, etc.); and provisions for flexibility. The foregoing ingredients must be coupled with recognized community and educational needs and strong school-to-community communication channels. (AL)",

Visual-motor development was measured by the Bender-Gestalt scored by the Koppitz Developmental Scoring Method. A special measure of attitude toward the programs was also used. Each program enrolled about 65 children. Because of attrition and statistical requirements, population analyses were based on a sample of 26 from each program for a total of 52 subjects. Results were based on analysis of covariance applied to the posttest data with control for corresponding pretest information. Children in the typical indoor summer school  program improved more in visual-motor development and arithmetic. No significant differences not accounted for by pretest differences were noted for attitudinal and reading modification. (Author)",

        "description":"In an effort to develop behavioral objectives for students of Phoenix Indian High School, project staff attempted to identify student behavioral outcomes which would serve as guidelines for total school program development, with emphasis on pupil personnel services. Preparation of such guidelines involves not so much formulation of specific behavioral objectives as creation of a method of attack, a procedure which will facilitate the writing of behavioral objectives. Because of the unique population being treated, it is necessary that those involved in educating the Indian student be aware of student backgrounds, aspirations, sensitivities, academic abilities, and potential for growth. This is particularly essential when it comes to writing, instituting, and evaluating behavioral  objectives. Additionally, those directly involved in the educational process should formulate the guidelines. Once staff involvement has been secured, a common frame of reference is essential. Without this, objectives will vary in specificity, comprehensiveness, and articulation. Thus, it is recommended (1) that taxonomy proceed from the specific to the abstract, thus insuring articulation, and (2) that the taxonomy be comprehensive enough to guard against superficial efforts. Part 1 of the taxonomy presented in the document deals with the cognitive domain; part 2 deals with the affective domain. (LS)",

        "description":"Relationships existing between elements of intelligence, age, and environment and meaningfulness of materials were examined along with the hypothesis that an increase in meaningfulness of materials would cause the mean difference in learning scores for different intelligence levels to first increase, then decrease. In a paired-associate task, three lists of eight CVC trigram pairs of varying meaningfulness ratings were presented 10 times each to 292 subjects. Of these, 55 were college sophomores, 60 were high school seniors, 60 were high school freshmen, 57 were sixth graders, and 60 were third graders. Data collected on each subject included an IQ score, a socioeconomic status rating, and four measures of association on the trigram pairs representing varying degrees of  meaningfulness. Results showed that relationships did in fact exist between intelligence and meaningfulness, between age and meaningfulness, and between socioeconomic status and meaningfulness. Mean differences in learning and IQ decreased with increases in meaningfulness, but in differing degrees for different age levels. Implications of these results for beginning reading instruction are discussed and include increased attention to associating tasks with children's experiences, language patterns, and environment.

The National Reading Council was formed in order to mobilize and coordinate the skills and resources of the communication media, business, labor, and the general public. Planning efforts were undertaken at both the state and the Federal levels. Using the Convergence Technique originally developed for biomedical research and development problems, an organization chart for the 10-year National Right to Read Effort was developed. It provided for the following three major areas of activities: (1) Reading Progress Activities which are to lead to  the development, dissemination, and adoption of effective instructional systems and goal achievement measurement; (2) Information and Coordination Activities which keep channels of communication open between the public, educators, local, state, and federal agencies, and national coordinators; and (3) Complementary Activities proposed for increasing the probability of achieving the goal and reducing the cost.

        "description":"Verbal responses of 50 college freshmen were compared to determine whether any differences existed between the types of responses given by students listed as high or low in verbal ability according to the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The students, from two colleges, were tested individually using an experimenter-devised language inventory which asked for first reaction verbal responses to a list of mixed concrete and abstract words. The verbal responses were analyzed according to a paradigmatic or syntagmatic classification. A t-test used to analyze the scores indicated a significant difference between verbal SAT achievement and mean syntagmatic responses--low verbal ability students produced significantly more syntagmatic responses. These results and others cited implied that  a shift from syntagmatic to paradigmatic responses might be the result of learning which could take place at any time rather than having a part in a developmental sequence. It was concluded that since standardized tests often require paradigmatic responses it is important that students understand the superordinate, coordinate, whole-part, or contrast structures necessary to make such responses. It was further concluded that assessment of verbal response type is a good predictor of SAT verbal performance. References and tables are included. (MS)",

Subjects were 40 Negro and 40 white first graders randomly assigned to one of four groups. Condition 1 consisted of pretraining in both \"mediation\" instruction (experimenter gave subjects a sentence with pairs) and of \"induced mediation\" instruction (subjects made up sentences with pairs). Condition 2 consisted of \"mediation\" pretraining, Condition 3 of \"induced mediation\" pretraining, and Condition 4 of no pretraining. All subjects were given a paired-associate task with no instructions. Significant condition and treatment effects were found for combined groups such that provision of mediators and induced mediators resulted in  superior performances compared to controls. While white first graders were superior to Negro first graders under conditions of \"no mediation\" or \"induced mediation\" instructions, there were no significant differences under \"mediation\" and \"mediation plus induced mediation\" conditions. No significant differences appeared between groups under the three treatments.

To measure the effectiveness of two different methods of training children to attend to the critical features of letters, 40 first-grade urban children were presented two pairs of letters (similar and dissimilar) simultaneously or successively. Unexpectedly, it was found that with highly similar stimuli (b and d) the successive problem was less difficult than the simultaneous problem; while with dissimilar stimuli (s and b) the successive presentation was more difficult. Due to this finding, a more complex experiment which combined highly similar letters into trigrams was carried out with 48 first-grade children. Similar results were obtained as in the first experiment. From two additional studies it was found that  children with some reading training used the initial and then the final letter of a word as the most important cues in word recognition. A study of the cues used by young children in identifying a word aurally revealed that the final and the initial consonant syllables were chosen more frequently than any of the given five cues. It was also shown by this study that visual word recognition experimental techniques are feasible in studying the aural modality. References are included. (DH)",

        "description":"The building block theory of language structure, an information processing approach, is applied to the development of a model of the reading process. Specifically, the model is concerned with the amount of time an individual will spend reading and the amount of content he will decode which is determined by a series of cognitive processes involving some aspects of sampling, matching, switching, analysis of subjective probabilities, and analysis of syntax. According to the model, a person intending to read a communication message begins by evaluating the message on the basis of likelihood that it might be comprehensible, sensational, opinionated, etc. and uses that basis to make several hypotheses about the quality of the message. He then gathers information from the syntax of the  message with which to evaluate his hypotheses. Once he has decided on the merits of an hypothesis, he continues reading until he has enough information to begin the process again. Several possible applications of this model for reading research are given. One suggests that since people often read only beginning and final paragraphs, the repositioning of important data might require shifting of reading emphasis. Another application might be in training individuals to look for higher levels of abstraction when they read. Research on the model is urged. References are included. (MS)",

Some of the major variables that have been found to influence the reader's use of context are constraints of textual segment, word frequency, syntactic variables, and grammatical class form of a word. Theoretical models of grammar developed by linguists have provided a frame of reference within which hypotheses and the results of empirical tests can be linked together to formulate theoretical constructs directed toward new areas of reading research. Ultimately theory must include both syntactic and semantic accounts of the textual constraints used by the reader  to determine meaning during the reading act.

Since the community college has an open enrollment plan, the needs in this regard are widely varied. In order to meet those needs, a study was made of the 358 students in the college's initial enrollment population. The Nelson-Denny Reading Test was administered in order to determine reading levels and abilities. About 30 percent of the students were reading at or above grade level, around 33 percent were reading slightly below grade level, and around 36 percent were reading considerably below grade level. The Dale Chall readability formula was applied to texts to determine levels of reading ability needed to understand these  materials. Considerable discrepancies were noted between the two, since nearly half of the texts required grade level reading ability or better and none was suitable for the poorest readers. It was suggested that efforts be made to match students with texts they can understand and to guide students into appropriate courses. Recommendations for improving the program and for encouraging publishers to produce more readable materials were made. Tables of textbook readability levels and references are included. (MS)",

The paradigm includes the selection of (1) relevant variables for study and (2) the method of study. Two types of reading materials used in Chicago schools were studied--Cracking the Code (CTC) and the Mott Semi-Programmed Series in Language Skills (MLS). Random procedures were used to select the 36 classrooms studied (two classrooms at each of the fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grade levels from schools in each of six school districts representing high, middle, and low socioeconomic levels). Teachers in these classrooms were randomly assigned to one of the programs for 1 month and asked to use the programs as supplements to regular instruction. Pretesting and  post-testing results were compared. Among the conclusions were (1) that program effects are multiple, (2) that differences based on socioeconomic levels vary at different grade levels, and (3) that no simple decisions are possible regarding which of the programs is superior. Tables of analysis of variance results and references are included. (MS)",

A total of 172 first-grade subjects, 78 in the normal group and 94 in the retarded group, were chosen on the basis of Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores. These children, from 11 New York City schools, were also tested using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT), the Wide Range Achievement Tests (WRAT), and 17 readiness measures, all composed of verbal material. Factor analysis and other multiple regression procedures were used to analyze the data.  Significant differences, attributable to the differences in mental age, were found between the two groups on almost all measures. Among the findings were that (1) auditory and visual skills were dominant for the retarded group, (2) only auditory skills were pertinent for the normal group, (3) a visual wordness subtest was the best predictor for the retarded group, and (4) a learning sample subtest correlated with skill acquisition for both groups.

This structure made it possible to operationally define similarity and assess the effects of RI for inferential information as well as that stated directly in the original passage. Subjects, 40 college students, read the same passage, and half of them were immediately administered a retention test. Subjects then read either a passage highly similar to the first or a completely different passage. Three retention tests were then given to all subjects. A 2x2 design was used to test the effect of similarity and the influence of an immediate test of original learning upon later retention. Overall retention was  significantly higher when the original learning test was included, but similarity appeared to affect RI on some measures only in the absence of the test. (Author/MS)",

Data collected from a sample of 664 first-year LLL students indicated that these children read at rates beyond those reported for the norming sample and that reading rate achievement may be, in large part, a function of instrument use since rate increases appeared to be consistently related to LLL cycles completed.  Cycles completed reflect the amount of instrument use to which the children have been exposed. The average reading rate attained with comprehension was 137.5 words per minute after 16-20 cycles of LLL instruction.

Before a student is accepted into the program, he is evaluated through standardized tests and an interview with two staff psychologists who determine his emotional, mental, and motivational qualifications. An individualized 40-hour-per-week program is designed for each student. It is based on a learning model involving the following three types of behaviors: (1) incorporative (visual, aural, and kinesthetic); (2) processing (thought, emotion, and motivation); and (3) projective (movement, written, and oral). The program includes reading, writing, and speech laboratories, group and  individual counseling, and courses in problem solving, motivation, time study, mathematics, dramatic interpretation, and psychology. Of the 42 students who enrolled in college after attending the SDC during the first one and one-half years of its operation, followup information has been received from 19 students to date.

The CIC institutions include the University of Illinois, Indiana University, University of Iowa, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Purdue University, University of Wisconsin, and the University of Chicago. The survey was conducted during 1970 by a team from the University of Wisconsin by means of on-site interviews and conferences with faculty members, researchers, administrators, and students. These components of environmental studies are reviewed: university-wide committees, centers and institutes for  environmental studies; interdisciplinary environmental research; university external affairs; student environmental activities; and rationale behind formation of new environmental institutes. Conclusions indicate that seven of the CIC Universities have established, or are establishing, university-wide Environmental Study Centers or Institutes, and that a variety of new environmentally-oriented courses in many disciplines are being developed. Other conclusions and recommendations are provided. Appendices include persons contacted, new courses, and student environmental organizations. (PR)",

Teachers were randomly assigned to one of three groups; audiotape feedback, videotape feedback, control. The teachers in the two feedback groups participated in an instructional sequence on microteaching procedures which involved about 13 hours of instruction in a four-week period. Teachers were asked to conduct tutoring sessions before and after the training sequence. Videotapes of these sessions were rated for the teacher's use of diagnostic questions, demonstration techniques, evaluation examples, practice phases, and verbal praise. The results indicate that videotape and audiotape feedback are generally equally effective in producing  gains in these tutoring skills. (CT)",

The study also proposed to determine whether students are consistent across structures and embodiments in the strategies they use and the evaluations they give. One hundred adolescent girls were given three experimental tasks in game playing situations. In each task the student manipulated an apparatus that embodied a mathematical structure. The goal was to learn the rules of the game so as to make correct predictions about the outcome of each move. The first task, a Color Game, had been used by Dienes and Jeeves and was based on the Klein group. Task two, a Map Game, had a network structure. The third task, a Light Game, also embodied  the Klein group. Students' evaluations of how the game was played for the two group structure tasks fell into three categories--operator, pattern, or memory. Evaluations of the network structure game were categorized depending on whether the student focused on parts of the network or considered it as a whole. The sequence of a student's moves on each task was taken as a measure of the strategy she was using. Findings supported Dienes and Jeeves conclusions that the distribution of evaluations is ordered in decreasing frequency of occurrence as pattern, memory, operator and in decreasing efficiency as measured by the length of play as operator, pattern, memory.

At the completion of the program each student was interviewed and given a written questionnaire to complete. Pretest scores were used to assign students to certain \"concept blocks.\" Each student was then branched to one of five levels based on their performance on a non-standardized internal pretest. Teachers received daily analyses of each student's work and each student received a print-out of the day's lesson. Concepts studied by the students ranged  from addition and subtraction of whole numbers to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions and decimals. Results of an analysis of available data indicated that although students achieved significant gains when measured by an internal test directly related to the instructional content, they did not achieve significantly more as measured by scores on the Wide Range Achievement Test. There seemed to be evidence that the students' interest in mathematics increased and the programed materials did seem to be appropriate in terms of level of difficulty and reading. (FL)",

The lessons are useful for students in the intermediate grades and upward, depending on specific needs and abilities. Each lesson starts with a pretest for self-assessment purposes. If the score on the pretest indicates the pupil needs further study on the particular lesson, general subject matter pages are provided and recommended for reading. Following this is the major concept of the lesson, behavioral objectives, questions and statements to be written, and a self-assessment quiz. Eight optional activities follow the final lesson including a crossword puzzle and work puzzles of  various kinds. The appendix contains a posttest for elementary and junior high school students and answer keys to all questions in the booklet -- lesson pretests, learning activity and self-assessment quizzes, the additional word activities, and the posttest.

In the first part the author states the assumptions upon which the remainder of the paper rests. These assumptions are based on Piaget's theory of cognitive development and he presents six relevant points. The second part is a review of recent research on pupil's understanding of mathematical ideas. In the research devoted to students in elementary school he examines the child's understanding of number and the growth of spacial and geometric concepts--perspective, measurement in 2 and 3 dimensions, and time concepts. In secondary school research he examines the understanding of proportion, probability, function, and proof. The third part of the paper is devoted to the implications of  the first two parts for teaching. The author suggests that elementary schools should be less formal, have more manipulative materials, and provide for more peer interaction. In the secondary school the author suggests more active learning by students, utilization of concrete materials, and provision of time for student initiated questions and answers. An extensive bibliography is included. (CT)",

A. Donald Bourgeois talks about the impact of mass or urban living on man and his environment, culture, self concept, and education.  Nicholas A. Masters covers briefly the impact of political power on education including: teacher unions, and federal aid to education. He reviews a survey of the interrelationships of Community Action Agencies with public school systems in urban areas. Jack Frymier develops a conceptual scheme for understanding rebellion and authoritarianism as manifestations of behavior within social systems with implications for education and educational change. Gerald Weinstein describes the social characteristics of urban schools, and his model of educational objectives, methods, staff utilization, and school community relations. (SBE)",

One of the prominent lacks in dealing with values is that the instructional materials are typically drawn from only a broad middle section of popular books and magazines. The basic text attempts to provide a moderate view of events in the most efficient manner. But true inquiry into social issues demands first-person opposing views, in addition to &quot;objective&quot; materials authored by a third person. The decision of  what materials are used in social studies instruction should include consideration of literature not now present in schools, but the dissident press are effectively censored by: 1) lack of adequate indexing; 2) lack of knowledge about them by teachers and librarians; and, 3) lack of access to them in classrooms and libraries. A highly useful NCSS project might be to partially bridge this information gap. (A selected bibliography of the dissident press is appended.) (JLB)",

The student for whom violent gangs are an urgent, everyday concern should gain perspectives that will help him cope with the problem personally. Other students should be able to correct misconceptions and to deepen understanding of a serious urban problem. The four lesson plans focus on the inner needs which membership in gangs fulfills, on the risks inherent in gang activity, on locating or initiating alternative sources of stimulation and fulfillment for potential gang members, and on the nature of prejudice and discrimination and their role in producing violent gangs. The unit may be used in a variety of ways: 1) to relate the unit to current  events; 2) to work the unit into the direct study of prejudice and discrimination; 3) to use it in the study of city problems. Classroom activities are suggested, however, a great deal of background information on gangs in Philadelphia has been included for those teachers who wish to develop their own activities. Bibliographies of short stories, films, books, and community resources are appended along with the Bopping Game: A Gang War Simulation for the Classroom.

Its purpose is to inform member states, United Nations agencies, National Commissions for UNESCO, non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations of plans for &quot;International Education Year 1970 (IEY)&quot; and coming events. As proclaimed by resolution 2412 of the 23rd session of the U.N. General Assembly, the program objectives included: 1) functional literacy for adults; 2) equal access of girls and women to education; 3) the training of middle and higher level personnel for development; 4) the adaptation of all education, both general and technical, to the needs of the modern world, especially in rural areas; 5) the preservice and inservice training of teachers. In addition, development of  educational research, comparative education and study of new methods and media, the promotion of the idea of life-long education, and emphasis on education as a means for promoting greater international understanding are important objectives within the scope for action for IEY.

Graduate and undergraduate programs in economic education described in this paper represent significant steps toward the goal of having social studies teachers well-prepared in economics and the teaching of it. Some centers and Councils on Economic Education are developing programs which appear to be more innovative and exciting than those typical of the past. However, barriers between the departments of economics and education must be broken down, and economics programs for preservice or inservice teachers must include evaluation and, if possible, experimental research.

        "description":"Described is a media exercise which involved social studies curriculum specialists department chairmen, and classroom teachers in the Baltimore County Public Schools. The exercise was designed and utilized as a model of the content and processes that should be involved in developing an international perspective in social studies programs. The exercise served as a model in that it raised the kinds of questions that must precede curriculum decision-making; it encouraged the type of setting and stimulated the dialogue necessary to the success of this task. Participant discussion, as well as an examination of recent social studies and area studies projects pointed up the essentially regional or cultural construct that serves as a framework for the \"international studies\" of students.  Two frames of reference for social studies programs which seek to prepare pupils to function effectively are suggested: 1) a global systems view; and, 2) the world of \"probable futures\". Others mentioned include: studies of decision-making and conflict resolutions in settings like the Cuban Missile Crisis; and comparative studies of such global phenomena as political development, social, and economic change, etc. It is not the presence of the traditional, regional, and cultural framework that is opposed here, but the near dominance of that approach in \"international studies\".

Textbooks are inadequate because of their emphasis on conclusions and judgments. Controversial issues must be submitted to critical research and critical thinking in the classroom. To promote understanding the uniqueness of American democracy, the author suggests: do not indoctrinate; give politics a distinguished place in citizenship education; include a study of J. H. St. John de Crivecoller, Martineau, de Tocqueville, and Bryce. Discussion of ideas and values are a legitimate study. Much new thinking and planning are needed to make the obligatory teaching of the constitution worthwhile and effective. It is usually taught as a document without origin, background,  or setting; the emphasis is on content, not the evolving constitutional process; it is taught divorced from politics and the political process.

        "description":"This paper reports research conducted with materials from the Anthropology Curriculum Project, which follows a substantive model, to answer the question: was pupil achievement in anthropology primarily a functon of the trained teacher, or a function of the materials used by any teacher in anthropology. A quasi-experimental design involving intact classes, grades 1-5, was used. Half the classes were taught by teachers who received a special six-week anthropological and methodological training institute. Teachers were volunteers, pretests and posttests were used and replicated. No significant gains were identified by t-tests of mean differences or F-ratios from analysis of variance. The author develops a theoretical consideration of four teaching factors to explain why special  training in project materials does not enhance pupil performance. (VLW)",

        "description":"It is obvious to any observer that today the social studies is in the process of a revolutionary change. It is axiomatic that one of the universal goals that all these changes are aimed at is to make social studies courses more meaningful and relevant to the life experiences of the student. One of the fastest developing innovations within the social studies revolution is a new teaching strategy generally referred to as simulation or gaming. Simulation organizes a great deal of fragmented knowledge and provides an effective teaching device as well because both time and space can be compressed so that years of simulated development can take place within a few hours. This outline represents an effort to begin the development of an analysis system that will effectively provide a  method of analyzing autotelic educational material such as games and simulations. This system will be of use to curriculum supervisors, chairmen, and teachers who make curriculum decisions; to classroom teachers who use the materials; and to innovators that develop the materials. The dimensions of the analysis system are spelled out in the paper. Further work on the system will include explanations and examples of the items in the outline, highly selected bibliographical references to aid in understanding parts of the system, training and testing items to aid learning the system, elaborations on uses, and descriptions of success.

An act of Congress states that ACDA must have such a position within the Government that it can provide the President, the Secretary of State, other officials of the executive branch, and the Congress with recommendations concerning United States arms control and disarmament policy, and can assess the effect of these recommendations upon our foreign policies, our national security policies, and our economy. Major subjects of the report are: 1) Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT); 2) Nuclear Arms Control Proposals; 3) Chemical and Biological Weapons Control; 4) Arms Control Measure for the Seabed; 5) Nonproliferation of  Nuclear Weapons; 6) Conventional Arms and Military Expenditures; 7) Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions in Central Europe; 8) General Advisory Committee; and, 9) Agency Operations. ACDA policy, research activities, interagency relationship, status of the Social Science Advisory Board, and public information services are discussed. It is noted that a questionnaire was sent to institutions of higher learning as a result of increasing academic interest in courses related to arms control and disarmament. Appendices to the report include texts of Presidential messages, policy addresses, treaty drafts, Geneva Protocol of 1925, as well as lists of ACDA Depository libraries, members of the Social Science Advisory Board, and officials of the Agency.

Because the learning of universalism is seen as resulting from certain structural properties of schools, the sample used in this study was composed of 161 children in Grades 4 to 8 who were receiving their education through correspondence courses and who have had amounts of formal schooling ranging from zero to seven years. Data were secured through both questionnaires and interviews. The evidence suggests three general findings: 1) The contribution of schooling to the learning of  universalism is small and may be assumed by other agencies of socialization; 2) The pattern of learning this norm varies between the sexes, and among preadolescent and adolescent age groups; 3) Children's perceptions of the universalistic action of a general category of authority figures, including parents, is strongly suggested as the most consistent, positive, and strong variable.

        "description":"This paper reviews what some leading critics of public schools say about social studies curriculum and suggests implications of the growing &quot;free schools&quot; movement. The social studies have been charged with the socialization of children into the existing majority culture, and with teaching the knowledge and skills required for effective citizenship. Critics claim that in carrying out these charges, schools have actually deepened divisions within the society and alienated students from the culture. The &quot;new social studies&quot; have emphasized the ideas and methodologies of social science or have emphasized valuing skills on public issues. Free schools depart from both the older and the newer objectives. They emphasize the immediate needs and experience of the child with the goal of  his self actualization. With selective enrollment in &quot;free schools&quot;, the homogenizing effect of public school social studies will be absent. Wider variations in values can be expected. The existence of alternatives creates a pressure on public school social studies curriculum to become more present-oriented, more personalized, and more individualized. (NH)",

They were concerned with studying the local black community in its past and present forms from a cross-cultural anthropological point of view. A conceptual scheme of natural history involved the student as an active participant in the learning process. Another pedagogical assumption was that all knowledge is tentative with the subject matter treated as data and as people's perceptions of the world. The students performed as anthropological field workers with the central foci of the learning activities on collection (observing, interviewing, and recording), organization, classification, and the analysis of data on: family,  housing and household activities, male and female roles, food traditions, religion, folk traditions, and the economic systems of farming, money, and goods. Data was presented about other cultures to encourage students to analyze differences in values, behavior patterns, and social groupings. Important subsidiary class activities were: 1) discussion of books read, and student report presentations; 2) lecture; and, 3) class discussions on current topics such as drugs, contraception, black pride, and the anti-war movement. The processes and perspectives can be adapted to any grade level and are applicable in a wide variety of subject fields. (SBE)",

It was hypothesized that different teacher strategies promote different types of class interaction. Discussion styles were to be categorized as expository, inquiry-nonprobing, and inquiry-probing according to the essential components of reflective thinking: 1) recognizing a problem; 2) presenting hypotheses, and, 3) probing hypotheses by testing their defensibility. In addition, it was anticipated that the two types of inquiry classes would differ in terms of the cognitive interaction. Sixteen social studies classes in fifteen different Michigan secondary schools  comprised the sample. The intent was to audio-tape normal classroom practice with verbal behavior coded using the Michigan Social Issues Cognitive Category System focusing on hypothesizing, defining, clarifying, and evidencing. An I/D ratio similar to Flanders' measured whether teachers attempted to influence the discussion directly or indirectly (inquiry). It was found that: 1) the level of student participation was greater in the inquiry classes; 2) teachers tend to ask more questions and use student ideas more in inquiry classes; and, 3) the main aspect of teacher influence was the type of questions asked.

A 21 page questionnaire was administered to a sampling of pre-service, secondary level instructors from National Council for Social Studies membership, 1969. Data returns and detailed analysis are presented. Some general findings were that methods teachers 1) tend to equate the NSS with major curriculum projects; 2) were dissatisfied with the strong developmental role played by the projects; 3) saw the NSS as overly academic, cerebral, and  teacher centered; and, 4) wanted more emphasis on student interests, community activities, social action, and affective domain. Also, methods teachers who held appointments in schools of education tended to be more dissatisfied with the NSS than those in academic departments. Complete research results and their implications are thoroughly discussed with three explanatory hypotheses offered for the unfavorable perceptions. Of the three (obsolescence, role-conflict, and value-conflict) the researcher speculates that the value-conflict hypothesis is the most explanatory yet most difficult to deal with.

Each alternative includes some variation of team teaching, and is consistent with an underlying rationale that an introductory social studies course should lay the groundwork for more specialized courses in the curriculum. The implicit assumption is that the practitioners of the social studies do not necessarily study different things, but that they do study things in different ways.  (VLW)",

        "description":"As one of a series of reports in progress, this report is introduced with a discussion of the concepts underlying long-range planning of any kind, and the methods of research used to describe alternative patterns of evolution or change within various policy fields. The FAR method, which emerged out of the Contingent U.S. Patterns (CUSPs) analysis project, is an example. This method involves the projection of particular quasi-organic whole-body futures and sets of such futures that promise to describe or bracket the actual, unknowable course of things to come. It requires an alternation of attention between wholes and parts, between artistic apperception or the knowledge of details, and the logical analysis of interaction among the parts of wholes as in scientific modes of  inquiry. In this way a sober effort has been made to keep the method of projecting commensurate with the decision making process relying chiefly on individual gestalt appreciations. The successive cycles of analysis, component steps of projection, and the sectors and sector/factors of a matrix are described. The sectors are revised and mapped leading toward a \"values tree\" to be compared or merged with a \"constraints/opportunities tree\" to form a model of the aspects of United States society for generating alternative future histories. The current FAR method can be effectively used for the projection of a wider variety of future contexts from worldwide scope down to any locality that may be treated as a whole, such as education, social problems, the concerns of planning urban  transportation systems, business planning, or social science research generally within a sociogeographical field.

We can, however, project a set of significantly different but quite plausible lines of future development, a set of alternative future histories, which we hope will bracket the one future that comes to be. Since social indicators are specifically designed to serve as bench marks with which to compare various aspects of society across time, it follows that the more important indicators need to be designed such that they could appropriately be used in each of the plausible futures. A morphological method for projecting such a set of alternative future histories is presented, and interim results described. Development of indicators relating both to what is defined as the world macroproblem  and to human well-being and fulfillment are especially urged, as their use would help illuminate difficult problems that occur in all plausible future histories starting with the present. The alternative future histories are also used to illustrate how normative social indicators might be of practical value. (Author)",

How can concepts be taught? What are the implications of teaching?

With changes in the framework of the traditional social studies classroom and curriculum using sequential topically organized courses or a spiral curriculum organization, a  concept-oriented curriculum can be facilitated. It is necessary, however, to limit the number of concepts to be learned, and to limit the amount of content for the purpose of depth studies. In this way concept learning can be facilitated at any grade level. Parts of the Syracuse University Social Studies Curriculum and the Illinois Curriculum are reproduced for illustration. (VLW)",

Examples of categories are: personal and professional characteristics, motivation, discipline, lecturing, use of instructional materials, and discussions and small group work. In addition to this categorization, each item has been indexed by its key words and has been further classified as referring to behavior that is ratable, whose frequency is countable, or that can be treated in both ways. The item pool is stored on-line in an IBM 360/67 computer, and two programs are  available for use. The first program allows the investigator to select the items he wishes to examine; it produces a listing of the items requested or a deck of cards with one item on each card. The second program generates rating forms which can be used in classroom observation. One form can include up to 25 items.

Positive trends: The total training periods have been lengthened. Programs have become more flexible and offer a wider choice of options. There is a trend toward adoption of an interdisciplinary approach in professional courses. Practice teaching time has been increased, in some cases replaced by a preservice internship. New approaches to the development of teaching skills include microteaching and simulation games. Students are being involved in a formal way in program development and administration. Heavy dependence on formal examinations is breaking down. Use of closed-circuit TV for instructional purposes  within the institutions is becoming quite prevalent. Some attention is being given to providing the kinds of courses which might lead to innovative practice on the part of beginning teachers. Areas in which trends are not yet very pronounced: Individualization of the programs is not proceeding very rapidly. Computer-assisted instruction is almost non-existent. Institutions have not yet demonstrated a sensitivity to such needs in the school system as the problems of disadvantaged children, or to the possibility that the staffing patterns of the schools may be radically different in future.

The first danger in this approach arises from the problem of isolating the constituents of teaching and setting up a doctrinaire list of skills. The second danger is failure to consider how different parts of complex behavior interact with each other. The analogies drawn between teaching painting skills or the training of a pilot and the preparation of a teacher overlook the obvious difference between paints or planes and  students, who are capable of acting independently of the teacher's wishes, thus preventing a closed feedback system which would permit an accurate evaluation of the teacher's behavior. Primary emphasis therefore should be on the acquisition of principles to guide action with secondary emphasis on the development of skills. This dynamic skills approach regards skills as behavior in context with a perception of what preceded it and an anticipation of what may follow. It provides the teacher with a conceptual model in which there is sufficient freedom within the structure for the students to explore alternative paths to the desired goal. (MBM)",

The conclusions drawn included that the process of teacher education curriculum needs a theoretical base before the profession can engage wisely and economically in curriculum reform; that Phase 2 applicants did provide a blueprint for teacher education requiring dissemination and support; and that USOE must plan more efficiently and communicate more effectively.

It involves a mutual agreement between the Philadelphia Public Schools, the school community, and Temple University to pool their personnel and materials with the aim of creating an educational program that will individually meet the needs of each school and interweave students instruction, teacher preservice education, staff development, and community involvement. The program will begin in selected schools close to Temple University where a majority of the faculty are willing to participate. Administrative authority will rest with the building principal. An advisory council in each school will be composed of school personnel and officials from each  cooperating authority and will assist in the development of the program. The university will benefit from the moving of certain aspects of its teacher education program into the schools, the communication between the community and the school will be increased, the barriers between pre- and inservice teacher education can be eliminated, and a professional career ladder in teacher education might be established. The methods of implementing and financing the program are briefly described, and the role of the American Federation of Teachers in the program is outlined. (MBM)",

The first study, \"An Experimental Study of Professional Education for Secondary Teachers,\" conducted between 1965 and 1967, examined the proposition that valid content in teacher education could best be achieved by providing selected laboratory experience and content designed to produce functional behavior. The data obtained from independent observers, student teaching grades, and the Common Examinations section of the National Teacher Examination indicated that the experimental group showed more desirable and less traditional behavior than the control group. The second study, \"Teaching Experience as a Modifier of Teaching  Behavior,\" was primarily a follow-up study of the first project and was completed in 1969. It examined the changes in teaching behavior exhibited during student teaching and during the last 3 weeks of the first year of teaching. Results showed that certain teaching behaviors are significantly modified by experience. The third study, \"The Integration of Psychoanalytic Child Psychology with Elementary Teacher Education,\" receives only limited treatment because the final report has not yet been written, and no extensive or specific conclusions can be made from the data presented.

The supervisor training model outlined contains the following sequence: 1) A student teacher microteaches with the supervisor observing. 2) The supervisor confers with the student teacher while a \"teacher of supervision\" observes and codes the supervisory behavior. 3) The \"teacher of supervision\" reviews the supervisor-student teacher conference with the supervisor using the data  collected and viewing a videotape of the conference. In the third step, individual supervisory skills which need development can be identified and practiced. In a teach-reteach microteaching situation, this sequence would be repeated twice. (RT)",

Some of the 15 teachers had previously taken the inservice course Supervision of Student Teachers, and some had not. Results indicated that supervisors talked more than 55 percent of the time, and that they used the Routine category much more than student teachers. Very little higher level cognitive activity was exhibited by either supervisors or student teachers. It was also noted that the supervisors tended to set the trend in cognitive level and the student followed suit. Even  in a hostile conference, the thinking levels of both subjects tended to be very similar. The teachers who had taken the inservice course Supervision of Student Teachers favored somewhat higher thought levels than those who did not, a difference that was significant at the .001 level.

However, there was no grasp of the major contemporary problems in the social and political fields and the changes which they have produced in the motivations, aspirations, and values of students. The present generation is different, both in composition and character, from its predecessors. The preparation of teachers and school personnel has suffered from additional problems and has failed to maintain the balance between practical experience and academic prestige. Cooperating teachers have not been called on to participate as equals in program discussions or  policy formation, but have been treated as second-class citizens, with the result that the teachers are now claiming the right to decide who shall be candidates for the profession and by what standards teachers shall be prepared. There are two related solutions--to redefine the purposes of the university and to realign the preparation of teachers. Both call for a distinction to be made between the concepts of power and authority, with the purpose of the university recognized as a precarious consensus between the practitioners in the classroom and the faculty members.

Inservice teachers were trained in the Content Analysis System and in strategies of content sequences, including enumeration, deductive and inductive organizations for identifying and classifying, defining sequences, process analysis, and comparison and contrast. Pre- and post-audio recordings of class sessions by the experimental teachers were coded by means of the Flanders System of Interaction Analysis and the Content Analysis  System and were compared with data from a control group. Findings were that: 1) Changes in observed behaviors suggest training effect. 2) Content patterns can be identified by the Content Analysis System. 3) Interaction cycles and content development patterns are interrelated.

An important feature of the institute was a live-in arrangement whereby participants spent four nights in the home of a disadvantaged family. Most participants evaluated the institute favorably. In addition, a  4-month followup found that most participants subsequently engaged in one or more activities designed to improve education for the disadvantaged.

The purpose of this paper is to present a method for analyzing structure--the theory of directed graphs--and to review research on teaching that has employed this method to investigate input structure, memory structure, or both. To this end, the paper is divided into two parts. The first part presents fundamental concepts of the theory of directed graphs--digraphs: the axiom system, types of digraphs, adjacency, reachability, connectedness, distance, and vulnerability. In the second part, research is reviewed in which content structure, cognitive structure, and the correspondence between these structures are examined with implications for the teaching-learning  process. Throughout this review, implications for further research on teaching using digraphs are set forth. (Author/RT)",

        "description":"Art education has been a part of the curriculum of American public schools for more than a century, since the first programs for drawing instruction were organized in Massachusetts in the 1870's. Since that time, a theme has emerged which continues to characterize art education into the present: the paradox that art education has consistently embraced rationales for its place in the curriculum which have generally advanced the interests of everything but art. To understand how art education has become historically tethered to the service of almost every other area of school life, this study examines the leading ideas of art educators within the broad educational, cultural, social, and economic contexts within which public school art has functioned. The influences are organized in  the study in eight sections: 1) Concern for Commerce: In the Service of Industry; 2) Faith and Morality: The Influence of Philosophical Idioms; 3) Child-Centered Culture: Trends in Psychology and Mental Health; 4) Science and Sensibility: The Growth of Research; 5) The Child As Artist: Impact of the Progressive Era; 6) Government and Art: In the Service of Public Culture; 7) Apollo and the Sacred Grove: Relationships with Artists and Museums; and 8) The Percolation of Taste: Fad, Fashion, and Contemporary Art.

Third, it offers questions to stimulate general classroom discussion of the film (e.g., What images suggest violence? oddity? alienation? What use is made of advertising? What emotions did the film maker evoke? How appropriate is the term 'psychedelic' in describing the film?)

Dewey and his followers sought a way to provide the young with conditions essential to thinking. For all practical purposes, they considered reflective thinking and problem solving one and the same. Consequently, a method of teaching was devised which was based on problem solving: the unit method. In practice, this method permits students to formulate and answer significant questions in their subject fields. Opposition to this method is usually based on an incomplete comprehension of what the unit method of teaching involves.

Variations in patterns of speech and life stages which differ markedly from those of \"mainstream America\" (and depart from the expectations of middle class white teachers) account for the great frustrations of Black children upon entering schools where the value system and cultural assumptions are alien and where their own language patterns and  social structures are ignored or patently rejected. The educational system will continue to fail these children until the school recognizes and understands the differences as they actually exist, finds the appropriate means for utilizing the linguistic abilities of Black children, and recognizes the nature of Black Culture as a whole.

The MAT scores were highly correlated with scores on the CMT suggesting that the latter may serve as a reasonable substitute for the MAT for some testing purposes. The vocational interests for the male enrollees were most closely related to those of people employed in public administration and related social service occupations. The SVIB scores were moderately correlated with ratings of job  effectiveness and occupational satisfaction for the male Administrators. The test scores were not significantly correlated with the criterion measures for the male Nominees presumably due to the unreliability of the peer ratings and the homogeneity of the occupational satisfaction scores.

Advantages of these methodologies were incorporated into the model which was tested in an individualized mathematics inquiry laboratory which used whole-task approach. Five process goals were chosen to represent mathematics inquiry. Task analyses and observations determined criterion behaviors for each. Criteria were outlined for test items administered to children who were also observed in class. Additional validation studies are needed but some behaviors of this educationally important complex goal appeared to be tapped.

        "description":"Levels of aspiration and student predictions as applied to test performance were employed in this longitudinal investigation of the process of self-evaluation. Two hundred and ten students from a rural secondary school in general and earth science classes were grouped according to previously demonstrated academic ability. Throughout the school year, the students were asked to predict the percentage score they would receive on each unit test they took immediately before and after its administration. Although explicit instructions about how to make predictions were not given, several students were able to improve their predictions over time. More able students tended to be more accurate in their predictions than the less able; and there appeared to be no sex differences operating.  Trend analyses were conducted to ascertain the effect of practice upon learning how to make realistic predictions. The rate of improvement tended to be higher for high ability students, who gained the most from repeated performance. It is suggested that, since the study was limited to the familiar task of test taking, students were more likely to assess their performance accurately on this activity than on a less familiar one. Because many important decisions must be made by the individual, on the basis of ability and interests, after he has left the formal educational setting, a strong recommendation is made for the teaching of self-appraisal techniques within the regular school curriculum. The science classes are proposed as a logical place to start such instruction. (TA)",

His test was first administered to a group of \"experts\" whose ratings were in high agreement. Then the test was given to a sample of over 200 teachers and lay readers. Among Smith's conclusions was that over half of the teachers have judgment which differs significantly from the experts. This study sought to determine if rater differences as measured by Smith's test would remain constant for another set of essays. Six raters were selected, on the basis of their scores on Forms A and B of the Smith test, to read and score 71 seventh-grade essays. No significant differences were observed between \"good\" and \"bad\" raters. The results cast doubt on the validity of Smith's test as  a general instrument for assessing essay-rating behavior. Although the test does appear to separate raters in terms of their rankings of essays, and even though these rankings are relatively reliable, difference between raters did not remain constant for another set of essays.

        "author":["Sullins, Walter L."],
        "description":"Five-hundred dichotomously scored response patterns were generated with sequentially independent (SI) items and 500 with dependent (SD) items for each of thirty-six combinations of sampling parameters (i.e., three test lengths, three sample sizes, and four item difficulty distributions). KR-20, KR-21, and Split-Half (S-H) reliabilities were computed for these 36,000 response matrices and cumulative distribution functions, each based on 500 trials, compiled. Comparison of the sampling distributions suggests that there is more similarity between the SI and SD cumulative distribution functions for KR-21 than KR-20, and either of these have more similarity than S-H. For KR-20, KR-21, and S-H, the similarity of sampling distributions under SI and SD varies directly with test length:  the longer the test, the more similar the distributions. On the other hand, similarity varies inversely with sample size: the larger the sample, the more dissimilar the distributions. For both SI and SD item sets, the expected value of KR-21 is less than or equal to that of KR-20 which is less than or equal to the expected value of S-H. Also, for both item sets, the standard error of S-H is greater than that of KR-21 which is greater than or equal to the standard error of KR-20. The standard errors of the three reliability estimates vary inversely with sample size and test length, for both SI and SD items. In every case, SD increased the expected value of the estimate and decreased its standard error. (Author/AE)",

The robustness was studied only in terms of homogeneity of variance. The variances of the alpha subscript t values of n subscript l observations before the treatment event T and the variances of the alpha subscript t values for the n subscript 2 observations after event T were systematically varied so as to simulate realistic conditions under which the variances of the alpha subscript t would be heterogeneous. The actual percent of t-ratios exceeding 1-alpha superscript t N-2 for  these cases was found when the null hypothesis was true. The results of this empirical study were then compared with the percent of t-ratios exceeding 1-alpha superscript t N-2 values for the null hypothesis with homogeneous variances. The trends visible from the results lead to the conclusion that if possible heterogeneity of error variance is suspected then conservative nominal significance levels should be set if the IMA model is to be used in determining the effect of a treatment.

A psycho-educational model, involving teacher-pupil interaction, is developed, and a procedure (the Interaction Analysis System) is formulated for observing and recording behavior. Although satisfactory inter-observer reliabilities in excess of .85 are reported, further reliability checks are recommended for specific future uses of the instrument. The results of a study in 15 emotionally-handicapped classrooms, using the Interaction Analysis System, indicate significant differences in both teacher and pupil behavior between clinic and public school classes. The interaction Analysis System is proposed as a feasible  means of analyzing the variability of teacher and pupil behavior observed in classrooms for the emotionally handicapped and for use in further research of the process.

In order to analyze the resulting data it was necessary to construct and validate the trait measures obtained from the scale. A sample of the ratings on 144 migrant children, subjected to a principal components factor analysis, provided four factors: Cognitive skills, self control, relationship with achievement model, and dependency. Factor coefficients were obtained for the 25 items based on four factors and applied to ratings on another sample of 153 migrant children. Trait scores for each rater were correlated with those of the other raters for a total of three multi-rater, multi-trait matrices. When these matrices  were analyzed, cognitive skills, self control, and relationships with achievement model showed a convincing degree of convergent-discriminant validity. Dependency showed slightly less convincing validity. The findings support the overall validity of the four traits and have implications for future analysis of traits obtained from behavioral ratings.

This index was found not only to be substantially valid and consistent as an achievement motivation scale but also in regression analysis, with a criterion of GPA for the first semester in college, it added significantly to the variance accounted for by traditional indices. Groups defined as high and low on GPA were significantly separated on the index. It discriminated between groups of overachievers and underachievers defined on the basis of national test scores of ability and achievement. It demonstrated its superiority over  traditional variables such as rank in class and national test scores by establishing a clear and significant trend for groups of graduates with honors, other graduates and dropouts, the last group of whom generally look like the middle of the graduates on traditional indices. The findings support the search for rating scales calling for human judgment in lieu of grades, a search made necessary by the elimination of grades in some institutions, and de-emphasis of academic achievement as a sufficient criterion of the &quot;success&quot; of college students.

Six classes of 6th-grade suburban students with I.Q.'s ranging from 79 to 149 were used as subjects and were assigned to treatment, placebo, or control groups. The treatment group worked individually on the programmed materials of Crutchfield's &quot;The productive thinking program.&quot; The placebo subjects also worked individually on programmed booklets, but not on productive thinking. Four instruments from the Guilford battery were administered: Word-Group Naming, Sentence Order, Utility Test, and Word  Arrangement. Results indicated that the null hypothesis should be accepted in each case. There appear to be educational implications for the nature of the programmed materials used, the use of Guilford's Structure of Intellect model in educational research, and in the relationship between divergent and convergent thinking abilities. These implications are explored in detail. (Author/LR)",

The maximum likelihood approach introduced by Wright for the dichotomous case is applicable here also, and it is shown to yield a unique solution. The method of estimating the three sets of parameters consists in using the person-by-category responses summed over items and the item-by-category responses summed over persons to yield a system of (N+k)m linear equations in the (N+k)m unknown parameters. (N=number of people, k=number of items, m=number of categories) They are solved iteratively using a Newton-Raphson procedure. The matrix of Nm person-by-category estimates and the  matrix of km item-by-category estimates each have eigenvectors whose components are proportional to the scoring weights. The other factors yield the &quot;ability&quot; estimators and &quot;easiness&quot; estimators respectively. Computer programs for the estimation procedure have been developed. (Author)",

        "description":"The nature and extent of attitude change concomitant with experiences of students attending five predominantly black colleges was investigated in a longitudinal study employing the College Student Questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to students upon entrance to college and readministered upon completion of one year of college. The responses of 1520 students were obtained. Results indicated that students showed general increases in Cultural Sophistication, some increases in Family Independence, Peer Independence, and Liberalism. Increases in Cultural Sophistication were greater for students with higher extracurricular involvements and closer relationships with faculty members. The College Student Questionnaire holds certain potential advantages for studying  attitudes, but it also holds some limitations when used with black students. Substantive findings suggest that extracurricular experiences and close relationships with faculty members may lead to greater gains in cultural sophistication viewed as an attitude. (Author/PR)",

Instructional modifications suggested for implementation at Powel include upgrading program offerings and materials for the upper-level pupils, reassigning pupils on a more frequent basis, and  increasing intra-teacher conferences.

These include the provision of state level public information, the provision of information to local school systems, to students and parents, and the provision of information regarding educational progress. A discussion of the rationale for their inclusion in the program is presented, together with the methodologies that will be used to fulfill them. Additionally, this report includes two sections designed to clarify certain  aspects of the 1970-71 program. The second section--which uses a question-answer format--presents information regarding the substance of the program and information regarding certain of its specific procedures.

The process is considered especially applicable to industrial psychology. A scored autobiographical data form, which measures the individual's past behavior and experiences, provides for assignment to a specific subgroup characterized by a cluster of distinctive behavioral actions as determined by marker variables. It is expected that the use of such subgroups for additional experiments and field studies in psychological and behavioral science research will in turn provide more feedback definition of the subgroups. The factoral dimensions of the subgroup profiles include: academic achievement, tough-mindedness, goals, authoritarianism, and maladjustment.  Assumptions emerging from the study are that past behavior is a good predictor of concurrent and future behavior, and confidence in post hoc validity of biodata-based subgrouping appears justified. The model's thesis is that distinctive, differental behavior can be associated with subgroup membership and by matching an individual's biodata profile with the subgroup profile modal behavior for the individual can be predicted. Present performance, promotability, sociability, motivation, managerial style, individual responsibility, innovativeness are seen as predictor variables in employee behavior through implementation of the model. Advantages and disadvantages of the model are also included. Statistical data on subgroup validity is presented. (AE)",

Appropriate items were selected as measures of each component according to their content validity, suitability, ease of administration and scoring, and comprehensibility to the child. Items were designed to be administered by elementary school teachers. Reliability coefficients on the items are reported. Four profiles developed from the selected items allow for developmental levels in two-year, age-grade steps.

The model is a powerful tool for developing insights into what test items are measuring while permitting the investigator to spot defective items. It also reveals meaningful distinctions in the type of task set by different items. Two sets of specific examples are discussed to illustrate its usefulness. The first set of examples considers the use of item probability as an index of the degree of fit of the material to the model, while the second discusses the &quot;normal deviate&quot; matrix, which displays the goodness of fit of each item at each score group, and enables an investigator to ascertain the overall validity of the general  index. These examples demonstrate the applicability of the Rasch model to a variety of conditions. The author suggests that the model seems promising for civil service testing since it is not simply a means to derive scores but is also a powerful tool for test analysis, construction, and design.

These propositions are examined in relation to current problems. An assessment of the divergence of views on educational goals is made and an interdisciplinary approach to evaluation is recommended. The concept of cost-effectiveness is examined and a continuous long-term program  of assessment is seen as a standard pattern for evaluating educational programs. An interlocking, coordinated program involving guidance, testing, admissions, financial aid, curriculum and research, is proposed as a comprehensive and relevant measurement requirement for the children of poor and minority group backgrounds. Finally, the key role of measurement people is related to the future development of more sophisticated systems that will result in comprehensive and proper use of the results of measurement and the integration of those results with other data.

The 300 male students, aged 14 to 18 with IQs ranging from 43 to 83, were divided into an experimental group and a control group for the purpose of the project. The experimental group was treated in a program where the following changes were instituted: the time spent in academic pursuits was reduced from 5 days to 3 days; the school curriculum was modified to include a greater emphasis on vocationally-related material; and the students were assigned to a community workshop for additional training and rehabilitation services on the 2 days they no longer attended school. The control group remained in  school for the full 5 days per week. Results showed that more of the experimental group completed their year in school than did the control group. Fewer of the experimental group were institutionalized during or after the project, and some showed signs of personal growth. (GEB)",

Consideration must be given to the how, the who, and the what of conducting research. The best guide for deciding how to carry on research is the underlying principle that the broadest involvement possible in the research effort will result in the broadest acceptance. The more people we can involve in the planning, the execution, and the analysis of the research effort, the more effective our efforts will be. Vocational research must be directed more toward programatic kinds of investigations to answer questions facing practitioners day by day. If research is to contribute to an ongoing program of vocational and technical education, it must be used. A  system is needed to combine, package, and deliver information to state and local administrators in the form and at the time it is needed to assist in the administrative decision making process. The application of research findings to classroom operations is even more difficult. Effective strategies must be used to bring about acceptance of research information and resultant change in administrative decisions or program operations. (GB)",

Overall, the lodging industry enjoys a favorable image, having no prominent negative points.

It was found that exclusive union work referral systems are legal provided they operate in a nondiscriminatory fashion. These systems are widely used in the construction industry, cover approximately 1  million workers, and the unions are almost solely responsible for their administration.

The concept is a form of vocational education that prepares the individual to enter into gainful employment in a number of occupations which have sufficient commonalities in human requirements and kinds of work to permit a high degree of mobility within the cluster. Its principal mission was to provide job entry skills and second level skills in a series of related areas. This movement was prompted by the increasing mobility of people, the need for mobility within an industry, the need to adopt to technological changes, and the problem of selecting one's life work. The first phase of the project was devoted to a number of important probes and  developments, the second phase to teacher education and the preparation of curriculum materials, the third to implementation and further development through field testing and evaluation at the secondary level, and the fourth to implementation and development through testing and evaluation including placement and followup of subjects.

Based on data collected from 109 vocational agriculture departments, findings are summarized according to: (1) the attributes of FFA chapters, (2) the relationship between selected FFA chapters and vocational agriculture departments and the extent to which students participate in FFA, (3) characteristics of vocational agriculture students, and (4) the relationship between selected characteristics of vocational agriculture students and their degree of participation in FFA activities. A major conclusion drawn from the findings is that the extent to which students  participate in FFA activities is influenced primarily by the number of years students have been enrolled in vocational agriculture. It also was noted that participation of members in FFA activities is increased as chapters provide an opportunity for a high percentage of the membership to become involved in leadership positions within the chapter. Following the conclusions are several recommendations concerning needed research. (Author/JS)",

To conduct the study, the Duncan's New Multiple Range Test was used to analyze questionnaire data collected for the two samples of homemakers which were taken from four states. One questionnaire was completed by full time homemakers and a shorter questionnaire was completed by employed homemakers. A low score on the instruments designated that the homemaker had a positive perception of her own homemaking abilities. These perceptions were analyzed in terms of variables such as: (1) the  husbands' occupation for the full-time homemaker and wife's own occupation for the employed homemaker, (2) years of high school home economics enrollment, and (3) geographic location. Based on these variables it was concluded that the perceived effectiveness of full-time homemakers increased with enrollment in high school home economics classes, with years of participation in homemaker's clubs, and with amount of time spent in homemaking tasks under parental supervision.

Reasons given by the residents who would change were adjustment of schedules for marriage, money, and part-time employment. Further, 40 percent of the non-residents would now select the resident course because they thought they would learn more.

Through their replies, these individuals warned that future home economists in business must have a better understanding of the free enterprise system prior to employment rather than to expect to adjust to business with on-the-job training. Therefore, it is recommended that instruction to develop this needed understanding be provided through college programs. Another result of the 27-state survey was the expressed opinion that a knowledge of the respective specialization is of primary  importance. Furthermore, employers felt that university training should instill discipline of work, knowledge of the principles behind the skills, acceptance of responsibility, and the ability to plan and reason in logical sequence. Still another recommendation is that joint committees should be established to create adaptable and viable systems for reviewing the desired image of the home economist in business. (JS)",

These courses are entitled &quot;The World of Construction&quot; and &quot;The World of Manufacturing.&quot; and the instructional packages for each include: textbooks, laboratory manuals, teacher's guides, achievement tests, related hardware, and audio-visual materials. The  materials were field tested over a 4-year period with 20,000 students in 13 states and were coordinated through 124 headquarters and field staff. Workshops have been conducted in 45 colleges and universities for preparing teachers to adopt or adapt the IACP system.

Motor, emotional, and language development all have a direct relationship to the child's cognitive functioning--each follows the pattern of moving from gross and loosely differentiated states to refined and differentiated systems. Research in early childhood education suggests that all learning is essentially motoric and that oral language is a manifestation of early motor and language training. Therefore, learning activities which incorporate emotional, motor, cognitive, and language expression have the greatest potential for maximizing the child's intellectual growth. In assessing the language development of dialect-speaking poverty children we have come to recognize oral expression as a reflection  of a system of cognitive processes--that these children are not deprived of such systems but that they have different systems. Approaches to teaching oral expression in early childhood include the use of the dictated story, puppets, sentence repetition, play, dramatization, dance, field trips, and singing. Materials designed for rhythmic-physical involvement include rhymes, jingles, dramas, pictures, and chalk boards. The teacher must accept the child's dialect, but also provide a model of Standard English for her students. (AL)",

The goals are related to musical attitudes, musical understanding, and musical skills of the student. The emphasis is on the student's human values, interpersonal feelings, and his music. The course is organized using the procedure of a \"plastic teaching strategy,\" an organizational formula which allows for the teaching situation to maintain a capability of continuous change in shape, direction, or emphasis. The three phases of this conceptual organization are: Phase 1, exploration of student values, feelings, and music; Phase 2, experimental activities; and Phase 3, developmental involvement. The teacher's  initial task is to select one of the following teaching strategies: Strategy A--the teacher establishes a Musical Focus Area; or Strategy B--the teacher initiates activity without prior formulation or selection of a Musical Focus Area. The teacher may move from one strategy to the other as class needs are reflected. Eleven approach tactics are suggested as devices for mobilizing student activity, and samples are given as illustrations of how the teacher may use these tactics. Appendixes present a Sample Lesson Plan Form, a Conceptual Lesson Form, a 56-item bibliography, recommended aids, and selections of recordings. (DB)",

        "description":"The principal objective of this study was to develop a classification system for the elements of student and teacher evaluative dialogue which would account for (1) the content area--task centered versus peripheral, and open versus closed; (2) psychological tone--accepting versus rejecting, and neutral versus judging; (3) possibility for reflective thinking--long versus short, and repetitious versus singular; and (4) logical structure--\"entry\" versus \"sustaining.\" The secondary objective was to determine what relationship may exist between patterns revealed by the classification system and (1) personality measures, (2) creative strategies, (3) predisposition for learning in art, and (4) learning in art as measured by strategy convergence. Twenty art education students  participated in eight studio periods and 6 evaluative sessions, during which sessions, tapes were made which provided the primary source of data. The results of the testing of five hypotheses during the study show: (1) closed teachers use more \"entries\" than do open teachers; (2) \"entries\" or new teacher statements relate positively to aesthetic gains in art; (3) teacher open statements relate positively to gains in strategy; (4) there is no significant relationship between strategy of student or the teacher and any measure of verbal behavior used in the study; and (5) gains in aesthetic quality are positively related to the length of student statements and the percent of student talk. Data are presented in 26 tables. (DB)",

        "description":"The Valley View 45-15 Continuous School Year Plan, begun by the Valley View School District 96, Lockport, Illinois, in June 1970, calls for each student to attend school 45 schooldays and then have a 15-schoolday vacation. Thus, only three-fourths of the entire student body is in school at one time, resulting in a 33% increase in classrooms available. From baseline information, the following conclusions are drawn: 1. One-third more classroom space is available immediately through the plan; 2. Immediate savings of up to 5% per pupil can be gained; 3. Educational benefits accrue when overcrowding or double-shifting is prevented; 4. The community can learn to support four short vacations at four different times during the year; 5. If a systems approach is used and a good organizer  is responsible, student scheduling can be done in 2 or 3 months on a budget of about $1 per pupil; 6. Most teachers will take a year-long contract; 7. Basic research objectives can be reached more easily if they are part of the &quot;formative&quot; evaluation; 8. Teachers are generally willing to try a year-round operation; and 9. Support for the plan is given by economy minded taxpayers. Among the recommendations ar e that districts that are contemplating such an operation allow at least one year for planning, and that nongraded or individualized instruction be used to solve scheduling problems.

The YMCA Community College was responsible for identification of the faculty and for curriculum development, and the Division for Senior Citizens, Chicago Department of Human Resources, assumed responsibility for all administrative and mechanical aspects of program implementation. The results of this initial effort show that there is an elderly audience that is interested in quality continuing education.

The consensus of  opinion is that citizens, at all levels of society, are important directly and indirectly in the planning process; that a vigorous educational program involving a variety of approaches is both feasible and essential in a successful planning program; and that the professional planner is central to the success of planning as an initiator and sustainer of activity designed to educate the legislator and citizen alike.

Interview data were collected from adult students about their experiences in the light of the policies described, and a number of obstacles to successful study encountered by these students were identified. A statistical analysis, based on data collected at Lakehead University, compared the academic performance of adult students to that of regular students. In addition, the relationship between adult academic performance and such demographic variables as age, sex, marital status, matriculation status, part-time study, and residency (in or out of the university district) was investigated. The analysis revealed that the mean academic performance of adult  students (age 25 and over) was significantly higher (p&lt;.01) than that of the regular college-age students. With regard to previous studies which had suggested that &quot;mature students&quot; (non matriculated adults) achieved at a higher level than regular students, the findings in the present study were in the same direction but not statistically significant. There were marked differences between sub-populations of adult males and females and married and single students. Matriculation status at the time of admission, and attendance part-time or full-time appeared to have no significant influence on the academic achievement of adult students.

Group I is comprised of 30 men who originally were enrolled in compulsory Title V and WIN programs. Groups II and III are comprised of 30 former volunteer students, mostly women, from Title III ABE classes. Group IV is comprised of 25 men who also were non-volunteer students assigned to a combination ABE and diesel mechanic class.

Approximately 800 contacts have been made since September 1, 1969, including new contact and follow-ups. Several have returned to Adult Basic Education classes; others have expressed a desire to enroll when classes resume in the fall of 1970; and still others have since earned the high school equivalency certificate. Upon rating the duties and responsibilities of the counselor-aides, it was revealed that there was poor  communication between the employment office and personnel managers in industry and the counselor aides, in an effort to secure names of prospective Adult Basic Education students. The tabulations found in this report portray the various areas covered in gaining an understanding of the program and students. Home visits and presentation of Adult Basic Education programs to civic groups produced the most interest and participation. Two main causes for withdrawal from classes were: (1) earned G.E.D.

It was found that of the recruiting groups those who were responsible for the implementation of the program had the greatest retention. The college student recruiter was not successful in dealing with this population. Better than 80% of those students enrolled by the ABE teacher-aide recruiter and/or the ABE teacher recruiters remained in the program. The increase in local and state  interest is apparent by the expressed desire to expand the program by the increase of materials and by their active participation in the program as consultants.

The evaluation of staff changes in attitude toward the device was made with positive results. The evaluation of class interaction between the experimental and the control groups was made. World-of-work skills were explored but not proved any more adequate than regular ABE if instructional time was similar. Typing skills cannot be developed with the adult in 100 hours of combined academic and typewriting instruction, but the electric typewriter did provide an ego-building device and rationale to the associates for attending classes. The project did prove that class size and attendance improved during  the 100-hour experiment. Recommendations for further use on a 250-hour program were found to be needed to confirm that the 20% withdrawal from the program was realistic. (Author)",

Specific objectives were to increase the basic education level and employability of this undereducated adult rural population, to increase the educational support of parents for their children, to demonstrate how the community school concept can get undereducated adults involved and informed through adult education, and to demonstrate to the New York State Education Department the necessity for, and the feasibility of, budgeting funds to support ABE in a rural, isolated Appalachia area. Thirty students were involved in the program, which  lasted 15 weeks; four withdrew. Three persons took and passed the High School Equivalency exam, and the post-test indicated all 23 of the remaining students progressed. All of the students still enrolled at the completion of the classes indicated a desire to re-enroll when classes resume. The New York State Education Department has made its first allocation to a non-urban school district in the state. (Author/CK)",

Four major objectives of the project are: (1) to determine the kind of training program necessary to prepare paraprofessionals to operate an instructional program utilizing programmed materials, (2) to compare the achievement of students participating in traditional classes with that of students utilizing programmed materials, (3) to compare achievement of students utilizing programmed materials in learning labs with that of students utilizing similar materials in the home instruction program, and (4) to assess and compare attitudes, both self-concept and teacher-student attitudes, in the students participating in the three types of programs. A  three-day preservice training program was conducted for six paraprofessionals and teachers. It was found that all paraprofessionals employed in the project were highly proficient in the exercise of their duties. Pre- and post-achievement level data were derived from one of three levels of the California Test Bureau's Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE); follow-up training was found to be necessary for some teachers and paraprofessionals. Teachers and paraprofessionals were asked to observe and rate students on any observable change in attitude. The most marked change seemed to occur in the home instruction program. (CK)",

In order to achieve this goal, a teacher-trainer workshop in reading is proposed. A team of four experienced adult basic educators will be selected from the Appalachian portion of 13 states. These four will undergo an intensive, pragmatic three-week training session in reading. A training syllabus in reading will be developed during the workshop for use by the trainers. The Appalachian ABE Teacher-Trainer Reading Workshop has been developed on the assumption that ABE teachers in Appalachia need more preparation in reading, particularly for rural adults. This workshop will incorporate  an introduction and/or review of the reading process with a strong element of application to supplement the present skills of the ABE teacher. (Author/CK)",

Friday is reserved as game day--the opportunity to integrate and test the knowledge and skills acquired during the week. The three rounds of the game are played in two simulated environments: Washington and &quot;the field&quot; (a simulated country called Nanesa), each game being concerned  with one of the three critical aspects of Agency activity: Policy Formation and Budgeting, Program Planning and Negotiation, and Project Implementation and Evaluation. Each of the games is discussed as to Game Preparation, Game Plan, Critique, and Game Materials. Charts are given of the Maxwell International Development Seminar and The U. S. Foreign Assistance Process. Diagrams present Space Requirements for MIDSIM I, MIDSIM II, and MIDSIM III. (Author/DB)",

A survey was made of a random sample of 250 respondents (164 whites, 83 Negroes, and 3 Others) from three sources. Findings of the study are: (1) Few of the activities normally assumed to lead to successful employment experience proved to have a significant correlation with success in the labor market. (2)Virtually the same percentage of white and Negro workers were either married or had never been married. (3) Negro expectations of discrimination seem to make them doubt their chances with the result that they tend to enter the labor market  later and to establish themselves more slowly. (4) Negro workers relied more than whites on the Employment Service for job referrals, but differences in the use of alternative methods was not as great as expected. (5) The training activities in the vocational schools seemed to contribute to generally more favorable employment records of those who took these courses voluntarily; it appears that on-the-job training is more successful than other types. (6) There is a similarity between the races in relation to employment success and school activities. (7) Social intercourse between workers was the same for both Negro and white. (DB)",

Two different approaches are taken. In one, the performance of job incumbents on reading, listening, and arithmetic tests is compared with their job performance as rated by supervisors and as indexed by job knowledge tests and job sample tests. In the second, identification is made of job-related reading tasks in  a set of MOSS representative of mechanical, clerical, and service occupations. Findings include: (1) For low aptitude men, a higher level of reading ability is associated with a greater tendency to use reading materials; (2) The greater the gap between reading ability and the difficulty level of printed materials in an occupational speciality, the less tendency there is for readers of any level to use the materials.

The imitation career is specified as an instrumentality in career development into which the author has integrated most of the important work on vocational development. The author indicates that more research will provide machines which: (1) can develop careers for individuals in the simulation sense of &quot;imitation;&quot; (2) will develop careers with individuals  in the instrumentality sense of &quot;imitation;&quot; and (3) develop careers for themselves in the artificial intelligence sense of &quot;imitation.&quot; He concludes, however, that in actuality machines don't develop an individual's career, but only help individuals understand their career development.

Two initial priorities must be the prevention of additional drug abusers and treatment for those who are already addicted. Essentially, the Special Action Office is designed to coordinate and direct a  coherent national strategy and to convert this strategy into an integrated set of drug abuse programs which utilize fully available resources.

Forty-eight normals and 48 retardates were given a visual memory task. They were asked to recall a configural presentation in a number of ways, immediately, one week after, and 6 months after the initial presentation. Piaget's proposition that memory is an integral part of intelligence is given support. Normals were found to be superior to retardates on the task. Similar findings are reported in a 2nd study which focused on a seriation task: (1) significant improvement did not occur in the performances of the youngest group, suggesting that the schema of seriation was incompletely  developed; and (2) overall, the performance of normals exceeded that of retardates over time, even though the groups had been matched for MA and CA.

Five male college students, who had sought help at the Mental Hygiene Clinic of a Student Health Service, comprised the sample. Ranges on the various MMPI scales are included. Each &quot;case&quot; is discussed individually and appropriate data graphs presented. While there are acknowledge limitations in the  data, the overall elevation of the profiles is high.

Play is viewed very broadly as: (1) intrinsically rewarding; (2) an activity which includes information search, skill training, and repetitious practice; and (3) a form of learning and rehearsal. The author prefers not to see work and play as mutually exclusive activities, but to view them as complementary components of all activities. On this basis, a model for vocational counseling is proposed, which  seeks to evaluate jobs on the relative degrees of extrinsic and intrinsic satisfaction which they can provide, and to determine which individuals would \"fit\" with what kinds of jobs, utilizing the extrinsic/intrinsic satisfaction dimensions.

Systems analysis is viewed as offering a useful approach for redirecting and reorganizing counselor preparation programs so as to facilitate and insure that they prepare counselors who are able to effect changes in client behavior. Several working models of counselor education systems are exemplified: (1) the Stanford model; (2) the Michigan State model; and (3) the Microcounseling approach developed at the University of Massachusetts and Colorado State University. How to construct a behaviorally specific  instructional objective is the subject of a brief digression. (TL)",

The decision-making process involves working through the following steps: (1) selecting a goal; (2) collecting all pertinent information; (3) establishing and examining alternatives and possible consequences; (4) selecting an alternative after weighing the risks against the values involved; and (5) periodic evaluation and modification as required, to approach the desired goal. Input for the process of decision-making about one's future educational career plans will require a knowledge of (1)  your own interests and aptitudes; (2) the world of work; and (3) the relationships between your interests, aptitudes and requirements of the chosen careers. Tying together the decision-making process and input for the process is a strategy which attempts to minimize the risk of error. (Author/TA)",

A total of 30 policemen and 161 volunteer college students, of whom 92 served as a no-treatment control group, were involved. The effects of 3 possible types of contact were studied: (1) squad-car riding; (2) informal dinners and \"rap\" sessions; and (3) encounter groups. Questionnaires which assessed attitudes and self-reported behavior toward police, as well as knowledge of the policeman's role, were administered to student subjects prior to and following the experimental conditions. Significant changes in both student and police attitudes and behaviors are reported to have resulted from their interactions under all 3 conditions. It is concluded that  seemingly polarized groups, such as police and students, can increase respect and understanding for one another when provided with a proper sort of interactional environment.

The experimental group used the computer to select courses, while the control group was assisted by the counselor. Three criterion measures, used to assess the relative effectiveness of the computer-based system, are described: (1) a test of student's understanding of information relevant to course selection; (2) students' self-reported reaction to either the computer or the counselor; and (3) a rating of the completed student programs by 5 counselors. No significant differences are reported. The author acknowledges the impossibility of concluding, from  this study, that counselors are more effective than computers in assisting students in the exploration and selection of courses.

In the first study, which explored the interpersonal and interracial attitudes of black and white youth and teachers, the concept of social distance was employed. Four components were selected for their relevance as important personal characteristics of influence sources: race, ability to understand others, competency, and trustworthiness. Each component was found to contribute significantly to social distance. The other 2 studies focus specifically on high school guidance services. Black and white students' and parents' attitudes and perceptions of these services are presented. In general, while vocational guidance was not found to be  blatantly racist in this small city, to many blacks, and some whites, it was not viewed as meeting their needs. For the blacks, it was perceived as racist. The authors feel that the concept \"guidance as a service to all\" was not operational in this community. (TL)",

Two seek to elaborate the basic principles and facilitating \"techniques\" of Gestalt therapy, while maintaining that one can truly understand only by experiencing. The use of Focus Groups, in which a focal topic is selected because of the group conductor's interest and belief in the growth-facilitating potential of the topic, in this instance, art is discussed. Results suggest that, with some qualifications, this was a worthwile Focus Group. The review of personal research on growth groups shows this approach to effectively facilitate the self-actualization of \"normal,\" growth-seeking persons. In the final paper, the rationale underlying  Fritz Perls' Gestalt dreamwork is explained, and its goal, common to Focus and growth groups as well as individual Gestalt counseling, is stated: more whole, fully integrated persons who stand on their own 2 feet and take full responsibility for themselves and their lives.

The 7 categories into which children's time usage was coded were: (1) sleep; (2) reading; (3) homework; (4) TV; (5) chores; (6) organized activity; and (7) free play. Two prominent findings are that children spend the largest amount of time watching television and relatively rarely do they read. In general, analyses show significant relations  between time scores and sex, socioeconomic status, family size, self-concept, IQ, and reading attitude scores.

Students who are \"internals\" will believe that their behavior controls academic successes and failures and may, resultantly, participate more actively in class or allow adequate time for study. Externals are less likely to engage in such behaviors since they are not inclined to see their actions as having such effects on success or failure. Two separate investigations are reported which tested the proposition that students who act to maximize their chances of classroom success are more likely to be internal rather than external. Results of the first  test, in which 499 introductory psychology students participated, indicated that, at the end of the course, internals had earned significantly more credit than externals. In the second test, using 169 comparable students, more internals were selected as high class participators than were externals. The hypothesis, thus, receives strong support. (TL)",

Three indicators of student-parent continuity were used: (1) political party preferences; (2) political orientations; and (3) perceived generation gap with parents. The findings show that, on all 3 indicators, student protestors were more likely to be divergent from their parents.

These are viewed as forming and validating a consciousness, on the part of students, of themselves as a class whose \"mission\" it is to reshape society. The specific question to which this study addresses itself is: do students see themselves as change agents and what effect do father's occupational level, student's occupational expectations and mobility expectations, as well as age, race and sex have on students having\"class consciousness.\" Findings indicate that 1/3 of the respondents support the idea that students comprise a meaningful change agent. Social class background does not appear to be a significant factor, though age, race, and future occupational and mobility plans definitely discriminate supporters of the \"student consciousness\" idea from non-supporters.

More specifically, the study would provide basic information on the antecedent child, and school characteristics  which promote achievement and adjustment following termination of \"de facto\" segregation.

The author examines the literature relevant to the effectiveness of desensitization with, and without, relaxation, as well as the effectiveness of relaxation alone. All 3 areas of emphasis are found to be supported by current research, thus producing a dilemma: relaxation vs. desensitization? Two attempted theoretical rapprochements are brought to bear on the problem, both of which call into question Wolpe's neurophysiological explanation of the principle of reciprocal inhibition. Is it actual physiological relaxation (musculature) or is it cognitions which account for the success of desensitization?  Other problem areas encountered in the use of relaxation and desensitization are explored.

The author utilizes a developmental framework: life is made up of interlinked role sequences involving cumulative learning. Each stage builds on the previous one. Within this framework, the role possibilities and expectations for individuals at different ages are considered. Some, such as school age, have been codified in law. Others are based on normal maturation in children (e.g., the age for walking). Still others are derived from the nature of the economy and social organization (such as the \"marrying\" age). Some of the problems resulting from age stratification are pointed up. For example, failure to meet certain  age-bound expectations can cause problems at a later age. Also, some age expectations are met more easily by members of one social class than by members of another. (TL)",

Correlational and path analyses with longitudinal data from 1171 males and 1105 females surveyed at the end of their freshman and sophomore years reveal that (1) if anything, counselors have more contact with students less disposed to higher education; (2) the student's educational goals and intelligence exert a direct effect on counselor  advice, but students status exerts only indirect effects; and (3) the counselor does have an incremental effect on students' educational expectations independent of the influences of the predisposing variables included in the analysis.

The effects of attitude similarity and authoritarianism on judicial decisions were found to be more complex than hypothesized. Generally, and compared to equalitarians, authoritarians are less inclined to judge a similar defendant as guilty and more inclined to punish a dissimilar defendant severely.

The results show clearly the economic and social consequences of many years of neglect and discrimination, and the poverty and underemployment that are caused by lack of skill, training, education, and counseling.

They also summarized their impressions of the interviewee and his attributes. The 2 major aspects of person preception examined, i.e., differentiation, or the number of distinct concepts entertained by a person with respect to his world, and integration, the extent to which dimensional units of information can be interrelated in different ways to generate new and discrepant perspectives about stimuli, were found to be positively  related to each other as well as to accuracy of perception, and memory of verbal and visual stimuli. An important implication stressed is that the aim of counseling be altered to the development of more abstract conceptual functioning rather than simple adjustment to societal norms, encouraging creative rather than accomodative characteristics. More open counseling relationships would be developed by counselors with effective person perception as defined in the study. (Author/KS)",

This has led to the development of many sound programs in the area of prevention and rehabilitation. Two programs of each type are described. At the same time, however, there are several issues which presently plague the effectiveness of behavior modification. In general, these issues relate to the need to establish behavior modification programs on an empirical or analytical basis, the need to focus upon possible side effects which are incompatible with long-range goals, and finally the need to  go beyond a demonstration of the power of behavior modification and focus on problems of generalization, bringing the behavior under the control of natural contingencies.

School system size and the respondent's position in the administrative hierarchy were used as independent variables to test effects upon authority level and needs satisfaction. Guidance administrators near the top of the school organization generally perceived them themselves having higher levels of authority than those further removed. Position in the administrative hierarchy had little influence upon the needs satisfaction of the incumbent. Guidance administrators in systems under 50,000 enrollment were significantly more varied in their perceptions of their level of authority  and needs satisfaction than administrators in larger districts. Based upon the findings reported and the limitations of the sample, it was generally concluded that the organizational factors of system size and position in the administration influence the perceptions of the guidance administrator.

        "description":"This paper provides a rationale for group pre-marriage counseling based on the social nature of factors influencing the marriage model. The author suggests that while group pre-marriage counseling invites disillusionment, it offers the antidote--the realization that disillusionment occurred not necessarily because of a bad choice, but because of unrealistic expectations. The group gives each individual a different perspective for viewing this problem. Moreover, there are other advantages: (1) it sounds less threatening than counseling with the individual couple; (2) it permits voluntary self-exposure; and (3) it may be seen as \"refined rapping.\" Some disadvantages include a possible difficulty in pursuing an individual couple's interest or need to their satisfaction, more  restricted self-exposure, and the tendency for some couples to compare their own relationship with others rather than evaluate it in terms of itself. Unique features of group counseling are listed which augment interpersonal growth and accelerate behavioral change. Based on practical experience, a discussion is made of the merits of having co-counselors to direct the group. Objectives of group pre-marriage counseling are given as a general guide for implementing the model. (Author/MA)",

Evidence to the contrary, in the form of linear correlations, was predicted to be due to the confounding influence of socio-economic factors. Among the more familiar demographic indices, only sex was expected to be a source of variation in special aptitude--over and above general intelligence. Data for testing these hypotheses were obtained from the \"Project Talent Data Bank.\" The hypotheses were generally supported. Intelligence and special ability were found to be independent of family size and birth order indices when socio-economic differences in intelligence were removed. No differences in special ability  were associated with socio-economic status after differences due to general intelligence were removed. These findings discount the need for special educational programs which might be planned for later born children on the assumption that they are intellectually handicapped. The sex differences in ability may justify existing differences in vocational programs for boys and girls. But the actual reasons for these differences require further study. (Author)",

The 4 rules of brainstorming as described by Osborn (1957) were presented to a student sample . Their task was to generate ideas on possible change tactics in terms of the escalation of the Vietnam war, particularly relevant as Cambodia had been  invaded very recently. With the criterion measure as the number of different ideas generated, the superiority of individuals over groups was clearly demonstrated, and the no-videotape condition performed better across all conditions, contrary to expectations. The effect of practice on performance, though positive, was not significant. (KS)",

Except for one female subgroup, the hypothesis of negative relationship between anxiety and career decision making ability was not supported; in fact for 3 male subgroups, a significant positive relationship was found.

        "description":"Typically, the student body in career ladder programs comprises inner city students, best referred to as environmentally handicapped--by such factors as health, economics, lack of political power and weak family structure. Those in higher education are considered \"high risk\" by institutions because their academic background differs from that of the majority of the other students. Furthermore, they are often: (1) older and more mature; (2) have stated goals; (3) have options of more movement; (4) can make more independent decisions; and (5) have more obligations (children, homes, finances) and personal problems. The total program is a period of adjustment and mediation between past and present experiences. The counselor's goal is to help such students cognitively and  psychologically meet the challenges involved in entering college programs in typically white, middle-class institutions, and to help them develop to their fullest potential. Above all, his obligation is to work for institutional, program, and value changes within the system. (KS)",

        "description":"Two of 4 junior high school counselors participated in in-service training in Systematic Counseling. The materials used in the training program were developed originally for use with the Michigan State University School Counselor Training Program. The approach of the counselors who did not participate in the training program was labeled Insight-Relationship Counseling. Teachers submitted names of students they identified as exhibiting low task-oriented behaviors. These students were randomly assigned to the counselors for 8 counseling interviews or to a no-contact control group. Each subject was assigned a task-oriented behavior rating based on evaluation of videotaped segments of his classroom behavior made following the counseling phase. Subjects assigned to the Systematic  Counseling treatment increased their task oriented behavior significantly more often than did those assigned to the control group. No differences were found between the subjects assigned to the 2 counseling treatments. These findings support the conclusion that Systematic Counseling, as practiced after brief in-service training is a viable approach for helping students increase task-oriented behaviors.

Examples of these resources are physicians, hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation centers, workshops, and educational programs. Most viable approaches to rural rehabilitation service delivery are limited by the assumption that the rehabilitation program is dependent upon the availability of traditional resources and employment outcome. The current trend in social service toward viewing people as total individuals with \"total life\" functioning and delivery systems from a total systemic view offers future clients hope for \"total rehabilitation\" as an outcome. For example, some agencies presently attempt to overcome the  resource and distance obstacles through a greater emphasis on inter-agency coordination, alternate staffing patterns, and greater utilization of client and non-traditional community resources than is generally found in urban service delivery. These 3 emphases are discussed in more detail. (Author/TA)",

Proclamation consisted of a written statement of reward and punishment contingencies (points gained or lost) under which the class was operating, whereas the contracting phase permitted students to suggest revisions of the point system and formally endorse it by signing their names to a contract. Implementation of treatments and subsequent reversals indicated that both proclamation and contracting produced a high level of appropriate behavior, but the contingent teacher approval, in the absence of proclamation or contracting, did not maintain a high level of appropriate behavior. The principal conclusion derived from the results  is that a student's formal endorsement of a contract, alone, will not radically alter his performance. (Author)",

The High School Personality Questionnaire (Cattell), the Personality Research Form (Jackson) and the Primary Mental Abilities Test battery (Thurstone and Thurstone) were administered to secondary school students to yield temperament and ability dimensions (only the former is reported on in this intermediate report). Separating ontogenetic (individual) and generational (historical) sources of temporal change was accomplished by application of longitudinal sequences consisting of a series of short-term longitudinal studies, analyzed by Schaie's time-sequential method. The results lend strong support to the  argument that, due to potential generational change, cross sectional age gradients are fallacious indicators of true age change. Systematic personality differences were clear between cohorts born but a few years apart. The nature and status of adolescent personality development appear to be dictated less by age-related maturational components than by the type of cultural ecology which is setting the environmental milieu for all adolescents at a given point of time.

The relationship between behavior problems in the preschool years and later academic achievement was also studied. Results indicated that (1) the temperamental characteristics on non-adaptability and withdrawal showed the most significant correlations (negative) with academic achievement; (2) children with signs of the difficult child did not appear at risk for academic underachievement; (3) similarly, the characteristics of high activity and distractibility did not show any striking correlations with academic achievement; and (4)  qualitative analysis of the behavior problem cases revealed a tendency for the low academic achievers to come from homes in which there was severe intrafamilial stress. Recommendations include that teachers be familiar with the characteristics of the slowly adaptable and withdrawn child and with the approaches desirable to maxamize his learning and school achievement. In addition, teachers should be aware that characteristics which are obviously troublesome in the school setting do not necessarily predict unfavorable academic achievement. (Author/TA)",

To deal with these 5 issues, the institute included guest speakers, group interaction, and field trips. Speeches are included. Based on a series of  questionnaires completed by the participants, the institute directors found that the participants were favorably impressed with the institute, and, upon returning to their own institutions, were revising their career planning programs.

The essence of simulation games was assumed to be to capture (via structured situations) the psychological and environmental  determinants of particular cognitions. The attitudes recorded were those of the 15 undergraduate players toward the consequences of living in a ghetto. The results provide some support for the validity of the hypotheses, but the complexity of the relationships calls for more controlled experimentation.

The education voucher system is described as one that questions traditional structures and methods while it equalizes opportunities to purchase education, fosters federally funded and controlled alternative school settings and programs, and gives parents control of a share of public resources for their children's education. Variations of the basic proposal provide supplemental vouchers for preschool education, education of the poor, reading education, and special programs for high school dropouts. According to the author, opposition by public school officials to proposed voucher experiments demonstrates the need for these spokesmen to respond with constructive reorganizations of their  own.

Analysis of data obtained from Indiana and Michigan respondents revealed that administrators desire to limit teacher organization involvement in the collective negotiation process and see the principal's role as that of board of education representative. Secondary school teachers believe in strong teacher association involvement in collective negotiations and reject the notion that the principal should be spokesman for the teacher organization as well as for the board. Elementary school teachers reject teacher organization militancy,  consider the principal to be a member of the teacher organization, and look to him for leadership. Results indicate that principals must formulate a role for themselves at the collective negotiations table or be left out. (Author/JF)",

Two areas of concern involve (1) a breakdown of communications between this organization and school districts because of the substantial personnel turnover in the districts, and (2) some issues that confront administrators and board members such as the need for updating instruction, a preoccupation with professional negotiations, a need to clarify and strengthen board-administrator relationships, and the continuing problem of school finance. District support of the statewide committee and utilization of its major research projects are suggested as two possible solutions to these problems.  (Author/MLF)",

Four authors discuss the subject from different perspectives. Fred Enns outlines the state of affairs in personnel administration, identifies the primary functions of supervision, and provides data to indicate how changing conditions in schools and society affect these functions. E.W. Ratsoy approaches the theme of teacher professionalism with the suggestion that educators have been too pessimistic in their views of professionalization, but adds that greater teacher participation in decisionmaking and more opportunities for individuality in teaching are promising developments in the move toward educational professionalism. Peter J. Atherton  deals with personnel costs and offers two alternatives to current practices: a new salary grid and a new form of staff reorganization. D. A. MacKay explores personnel evaluation in the light of new educational developments and proposes an evaluation model based on recently developed concepts. A related document is ED 044 793.

During the 1969-70 school year, services were provided to 483 TMR children in 15 different projects administered by the Mental Health Division and 14 agencies contracted by the Division. Change evidenced by TMR students in the areas of self help skills, language development, and motor development was measured by Gunzberg's Progress Assessment Chart, Parsons Language Sample, and Teaching Research Motor Development Scale, respectively. Scales were used to evaluate students (368 were both pre- and posttested) in all 15 projects in October 1969 and again in April 1970. Thirty-five tables  and graphs report the t-test values obtained for the TMR population in each of the three measures and in each of the subtests of each measure, t-test values determined by school for each measure and subtest, and t-test values by age level for each measure and subtest. Based upon comparison of pre- and posttest scores, it was concluded that TMR children along the entire age span of 4 to 21 years could and did learn from well organized, structured programs, in spite of the variables unique to each program.

Responses were received from 70% of identified LD teachers, 53% of identified persons in ED services, 61% of principals in LD, and 50% of principals in ED.

It was also found that divisions offering services to both LD and ED children were not similar in local financial support, size, or geography. Twenty-four tables  and graphs presented data indicating on the whole, little evidence of state recruitment and training of qualified personnel, no systematic means of identifying LDs and EDs, teacher roles more restricted than state definitions, no systematic referral and placement procedures, and little administrative planning and program operation in the special education field under survey.

Variables were lengths of training session and retention interval. Tables presented information on subjects and experimental conditions for the three studies, number of children reporting arrow-to-square movement in training session, and number of children reporting movement in arrow-to-arrow series in test session. Test results of the first study of 36 EMRs and 24 normal children indicated that EMRs must receive more perceptual training experience than normal children of the same mental age to establish enduring  perceptual memory. Results of the second study with 80 LDs suggested that LDs showed a deficit in long-term perceptual memory similar to that found for EMR and TMR populations, indicating a possible common learning problem, independent of intellectual functioning level. Test results of the third study with 24 TMRs indicated a trend toward reduction in effects of dissimilar-form training over 24 hours. (CB)",

The pilot and formal study I were conducted to develop suitable populations of stimuli conducive to minimal performance, allowing improvement room without arousing frustration. The Ss reproduced checkerboard patterns having 16, 20, 25, 30, and 36 cells, respectively. It was found that Ss performed above chance on matrices with 36 cells, cell number retained by Ss was not significantly affected by total number of cells within patterns, and visual channel capacity might be related to verbal components of intelligence.  Formal study II was conducted to determine if EMRs were capable of schema concept learning using stimuli patterns from both pilot and first formal study. One group reproduced schema patterned checkerboards, while another group reproduced nonschematic patterns. Results indicated that EMRs were capable of schema concept learning without either prototype exposure or external feedback. (CB)",

An analytically trained psychotherapist works 1 1/2 hours per day with up to seven children in the classroom, with the help of nursery school teachers. There is regular contact with parents. How the Project's application of psychoanalytic techniques in an educational setting with each child resembles and differs from regular child analysis and psychotherapy is considered. The established value of nursery classrooms as a natural setting for clinical observation and diagnostic evaluation and the psychoanalytic model (features of the practice of child analysis) are reviewed. The Cornerstone model is discussed and some  illustrative moments from the classroom showing the therapist at work are presented. An extensive case study is then used to show details of a treatment and to illustrate specially developed criteria for the psychoanalytic process. Cited are useful intense transference reactions and social, intellectual and educational gains as well as symptomatic improvement occurring in the Project, and the clinical efficacy of the method.

        "description":"A positive reinforcement system was designed to see if reinforcement procedures, proven effective in modifying a wide range of disruptive classroom behaviors, would be effective for children who are not particularly disruptive but who work so slowly and ponderously that they fail to make satisfactory academic progress. Subjects were five such slow learners, ages 7-9 years, who, because of measured IQs of 65-80, were in a special remedial class. Reading, using the Sullivan Programed Reading Series, was selected as the remedial experimental task. An ABAB reversal design was used to test effectiveness of reinforcement system in accelerating rate of working in the readers, defined as number of correct responses per day. In A or baseline conditions, students worked on programed  reading frames without extrinsic reinforcement, while in B conditions individual reinforcement contingencies were set (points exchangeable for store items). It was found that number of correct responses per daily 20-minute period was accelerated over baseline while accuracy remained high in condition B. When performance contingencies were withdrawn, performance deteriorated, but recovered when contingencies were reinstated. (KW)",

Pointed out are language factors to keep in mind when preparing instructional materials for the deaf, such as words with more than one meaning and other problems affecting comprehension of a sentence. Explained is the language grid developed by Project LIFE to be used in identifying levels of linguistic competency as used with certain vocabulary, to assist the teacher in preparing language materials to supplement those developed by Project LIFE and in evaluating materials for utilization in the reading and language program. The language grid helps the teacher identify linguistic structures which the student understands. The  structural matrix plus the listed vocabulary and concept usage listing provides the teacher with tools to evaluate the reading and language operational level of the student. The grid represents the sequential development of language principles and sentence patterns in the first eight units of the LIFE programed language filmstrips. (KW)",

Two papers consider social rehabilitation and the task of trying to move residents out into community life. The third paper tells how dormitory attendants can serve as teachers rather than just keepers. The fourth and fifth papers report on a training and education program for a group of emotionally disturbed girls, applying a behavior modification model. A half-way house program for stable working older women residents on the State School grounds is described in the sixth paper. The last two papers deal with outreach  services to bring former residents and families back together again as part of a therapeutic and rehabilitative program, and with social work graduate training within the HIP project respectively. A threefold increase in rate of discharges (residents able to successfully make their way in regular society) over a previous similar period of time is cited as evidence of HIP project success.

        "description":"Learning sets programs were administered to preschool deaf children from a variety of representative educational programs throughout the southwest to improve their visual perception skills. The concept of learning sets was described as progression from trial-and-error learning to immediate problem solving by insight. The project consisted of six 1-year phases. Documentation of deficits in visual perception of preschool deaf children occurred during the initial phase. Phases II through V comprised the development of a treatment program for strengthening visual perception by problem solving and free play. Problem solving involved the child's discriminating commonalities and differences within stimulus sets to earn reinforcement. Free play included the child's exposure to eye-hand  coordination toys in a free play setting. Phase VI featured identification of variables, compilation of descriptive data, statistical and test consultation, and data analysis. Main independent measures were five subtests of the Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception and the four subtests from the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. The study's important finding was the statistically significant increment in visual perception skills of the problem solving group relative to the control group as assessed by performance on the Frostig.

Color-word interference task was described as a method of apprehension evaluation with minimum memory contribution. The task involved three cards: one containing color patches, one containing printed names of colors, and one containing a color name printed in conflicting ink color. Seven deaf children and 17 normal-hearing children (age range 9-15 years) identified by good academic achievement were asked to name each card upon presentation. The task criterion was reading speed and thus, stimuli perception was the major variable studied. Data on time in seconds for subjects to complete the color-word interference task indicated that the deaf  seemed able to view verbal material as objects without attending to its verbalness. Normal-hearing children, in contrast, had great difficulty in responding to anything other than the word itself. Results suggested that deaf children used qualitatively different strategies for apprehending and processing verbal material than did normal-hearing children. (CB)",

Pretest and posttest measures on the Metropolitan Readiness Tests indicated that childrens' scores increased over 25% following only 18 hours of token reinforcement for academic performance (p greater than .001). The second experiment was designed to isolate the relative role of reinforcement on the childrens' academic improvement. The experiment involved 31 chidlren who were able to choose a class with or without reinforcement in writing and arithmetic.  Results showed that TMRs chose to work on the subject area having reinforcement and also, that the childrens' correct academic performance increased significantly as a function of reinforcement. It was concluded that TMRs could profit from academic training when an extrinsic motivational system was involved. (CB)",

Using this measure, a series of experiments was conducted using actural television programs as stimulus material. The results of these studies suggest: 1) Although the majority of children understand the motivation and consequences of aggressive acts as they are presented on television, subsequent aggression is more affected by the amount of violence per se in the program than by the way in which the violence is presented; 2) aggression presented as being performed with good motivations may lead to greater subsequent aggression on the part of the viewer than aggression presented as being performed with bad motivation; 3) justification  manipulations are effectively transmitted to all viewers, but these manipulations fail to influence the viewer's later level of aggression; 4) temporal separation between event and consequence may make it difficult for young children to see the relationship between aggression and the motivation for and consequences of aggressive acts. A general conclusion from these studies is that children, as they grow up, understand more about the television programs they view, but this understanding doesn't influence their aggressive tendencies.

CCT recommends that stations take immediate steps to ascertain these needs, to design programs to meet these needs, to insure that members of the community will be given an opportunity to participate in the development of these programs, and to  utilize fully the resources available in the community for the development of programs. Further, they recommend that the Federal Communications Commission consider the possibility of designing a special section of the television license application which refers to children specifically.

        "description":"The treatment of black Americans in a sample of social studies filmstrips designed for use in grades four through six was appraised. The purpose was to learn whether these filmstrips fostered the concept of a pluralistic society, in which races are seen as equal and in which blacks and integrated groups have an important part. Forty film strips were analyzed by a three-member panel, using a measurement instrument derived from the Detroit public school evaluation criteria to gauge minority treatment. Results showed that there was a significant relationship between filmstrips which foster pluralism and the number and percentage of black American characters illustrated in the filmstrips. Filmstrips were most likely to be acceptable which showed blacks throughout the strips and also  which depicted occupations of varying social status. As only six of the 40 filmstrips viewed were deemed acceptable, the author concludes that many more unprejudiced filmstrips are needed. (Author/JK)",

Average viewing time per night was three hours and 40 minutes. A large variation was found in the time at which children ceased viewing. The study found no significant difference in amount of viewing done by high and low intelligence groups, although children of high intelligence spent more time watching the non-commercial channel and documentary programs. Those children who watched little television fell in two groups. The first group had IQs of 110-120 and had parents who restricted their viewing and had high educational expectations for their children. The second group  had IQs above 120 and little parental restriction. High intensity viewers were generally less acceptable to their peer group than were low intensity viewers. On the whole, however, it was found that no significant correlations exist between viewing choices or amounts and personality scales. (JK)",

Two institutions are proposed: a National Institute of Education which would support creation of a research and development base for educational innovation and a system of institutions and technology designed to make instructional use of the computer in higher education truly effective. To achieve innovation, one must plan institutions to encourage and facilitate it, paying careful attention to financial incentives. Instructional use of computers today has a cottage-industry character. Two trends may change this situation: commercial  time-shared computer service and cheap, standardized mini-computers programed through an exchangeable medium such as a cassette.

Sections of normal size were taught as usual, while large sections had instruction augmented with televised illustrations. With the exception of these illustrations, resources were the same for both classes and included a programed text. Results on two types of tests, information and behavioral judgment, showed that student achievement was equally high, regardless of size of class. Furthermore, the larger classes showed greater uniformity of scores than did the smaller classes. Achievement on information tests was not clearly related to achievement on behavioral judgment tests. First tests of either type were better indicators of students' final performance than was an information pre-test.  Characteristics found to be significantly associated with higher achievement were sex, marital status, major in college, and grade point averages. One unexpected finding was that nonacademic students (those with majors in applied fields) performed better than academic students did on tests involving behavioral judgment. (Author/JK)",

The retention of the verbal message and the perception of the news items were measured for the different illustrations. It was found that the choice of illustration accompanying the investigated news items influenced not only how must the subjects retained of the verbal message, but also what was remembered of the message. In addition, the choice of illustration influenced the perception of the news item. The news stories which most subjects could recall were those illustrated by pictures that corresponded to the verbal information. Least remembered were those  which had items read by the studio reporter on the screen and those items that consisted of sound only. A news item illustrated by moving pictures was considered more interesting and more informative than one illustrated with a still picture. No difference in retention was noticed between moving and still picture presentation modes.

Thirty-four children ranging in age from five to six were selected from a sample of children who had seen a series of violent television programs and were divided into two groups according to high and low exposure to the series. The children were shown an additional segment of the program with their mothers either before or after the administration of a series of measures to evaluate comprehension, attitudes, and aggression. The mothers were administered questionnaires and attitude scales to provide information about children's viewing of television and the attitudes of the mother toward television viewing. Results indicated that there  were no short term effects of aggression; however, a larger proportion of high-exposed children than low-exposed children displayed more aggressive behavior irrespective of whether they had seen the additional segment on the testing occasion. Subsequent analyses suggest that the manner in which television viewing is handled by the family could be regarded as an intervening variable; therefore, the difference in aggression between low and high exposure groups should not be attributed directly to the television programs.

Data gathered for this study as well as other research in the area suggest that the first is preferable to the other hypotheses. Also, when third factors, defined for this study in terms of the family and parent-child interaction, were controlled, the correlations between violence viewing and aggressiveness persisted. Assuming that the first hypothesis is a parsimonious explanation for this  correlation, are there \"control mechanisms\" which could modify the causal link postulated in the first two hypotheses?

The large amount of uncoordinated research activities and the lack of pre-planned linkages between research and practice has led to the existence of an expensive cottage industry in educational technology which tends to re-tool every academic year. Computers hold much promise in solving educational problems, but there are several questions which must be answered if computers are to become internalized into the educational process. Computers may be either a tool or a medium; they may be internalized gradually or all at once; they may be centralized into regional computer systems or diffused around the nation in the form of  mini-computers. What is needed now is not another demonstration of the value of computer-based instruction, but a critical mass that is capable of providing a complete system and total curriculum. Educational research is basically sound; however, it must attack larger, more complex problems in a systematic way if we are to alter and improve the educational process. The necessary catalyst to unlock the potential of computer-based instruction could come from business, from education, or from the Federal Government. (JY)",

While the movement in research and development in education has been toward using systems applications to deal with these changes, there are some problems with this approach. The domain of academic policy is a far broader system than that to which systems analysis is typically applied, and it is likely that the long range goals which a systems analysis provides will conflict with the short-range political pressures of the situation. Also, systems concepts have evolved from industrial situations in which the organization is quite different from the decentralized, horizontally organized academic institutions with different  goals. For example, the input-output model is probably too concrete for education if, as it is now thought, 70% of those entering school today will work in jobs that do not now exist. Further, systems planners should not forget the human element in any system, especially as it relates to the processes of accepting system improvements. Finally, it should be noted that while information systems may have become a widespread fad, even perfect information may not improve system performance. (SH)",

Specifically, differential cost factors and teleprocessing capability may no longer provide a basis for differentiating between CRTs and teletypes. In this paper several experiments are reviewed, and the instructional and psychological implications of instructional terminals are discussed. The major terminal characteristics discussed are cost, teleprocessing capability, presentation, rate, and display mode. The major instructional and psychological implications discussed are device memory load factors and instructional time and efficiency. Student characteristics of intelligence and  anxiety are discussed in relation to instructional terminal characteristics. (Author)",

The underlying representation of these vowels is tense. After the application of the Chomsky-Halle Trisyllabic Laxing Rule, the vowels are lax and are affected by the vowel-shift rule, restricted in scope so that it will cover only lax vowels that participate in alternations. This can be done by restricting the application of the rule to lexical items that have been specially marked. The result is a rule that has plus-rule  features which allow a less complicated underlying interpretation. (VM)",

The use of borrowed words is a linguistic device to create a new Japanese dialect--Hawaiian Japanese. The borrowed words reflect the process and degree of social and psychological adjustment to the new cultural environment. Words of conjunctive and disjunctive concepts are individually borrowed to meet various lexical needs; words of relational concepts are borrowed as conceptual systems. From the sociolinguistic point of view, the most important words in a language are those related to kinship relations, social relations, time, and quantity. Further investigation of lexical borrowings in other geographical areas would prove interesting. The  study of lexical borrowing is worthwhile for the field of foreign language teaching. (VM)",

The best way to combat compromise is to have a large number of test forms. This report first presents an analysis of the estimated cost of test compromise. There is a discussion of how the problem was handled, and a formula for estimating the cost of compromise is given.

Chomsky's lexical redundancy rule is an area for further study, possibly to come closer to defining and achieving explanatory adequacy. If it is observed that English nouns come in two types, with the members of one set differing from the members of the other by a constant phonological and semantic increment, it is possible to note a generality by choosing one of each pair of nouns to represent both in the lexicon and then construct rules allowing for the general similarity. When all the regular relations between lexical items are expressed, the result is a set of simplified lexical entries, each one an abbreviation for one or  more fully specified lexical items, and a set of redundancy rules expressing the relevant generalities and subgeneralities of the lexicon. Given here are the major types of lexical redundancy rules for English nouns and what they can accomplish. Actual rules and examples are provided. A list of references is included. (Author/VM)",

One type projects a filmstrip which is advanced automatically and inaudibly by the accompanying recording. Stories interesting to small children have been adapted for this machine. Songs and language drills accompany each story. Each story has a Spanish and an English version. The other unit, which plays back a six-second recording on individual, illustrated cards, permits endless repetitions of each recorded utterance but does not guarantee a fixed sequence of  illustrations and sounds. Additional activities, songs, and games have also been created. Testing has been modified into a telephone-circuit arrangement with the examiner and tape recorder, the subject, and a third party.

According to the results, there is an overwhelming preference for speakers of standard English. The context of the experiment must be considered along with the results, and reasons for the results should be  questioned.

The words chosen for the drills are mostly verbs with a heavy literary bias; meaning and normal colloquial usage (aside from pronunciation) are not important here.

In Latin America, the native language is Spanish or Portuguese, and student background is much more homogeneous. TESOL began earlier in Latin America and the need there is greater. Effective TESOL instruction in Latin America often lies outside the realm of the governmental educational system, and much of it is accomplished through binational centers which receive support from the United States government. Teacher preparation is not as sophisticated, and teaching procedures are often based on pragmatism rather than linguistic theory. The Teachers of English to Speakers of Othe Languages should organize a department for teaching  English to speakers of Spanish (TESS) and should design programs for that particular area. The organization should broaden its scope and not limit itself to problems of American teachers or to students in the United States. (VM)",

There is a marked dirrerence between literary Tamil and spoken Tamil, and training in the former is not sufficient for speaking the language in everyday situations with reasonably educated native speakers. There is difficulty in finding suitable material that illustrates standard colloquial usage. In the textbook described here, the transcriptions of five Tamil radio programs provide the spoken material. The reader consists of the texts of the five radio plays, page-by-page columnar glossaries, exercises, a synopsis grammar, a Tamil-English glossary, and an English-Tamil glossary. Technical and linguistic difficulties are described along with recommendations for future projects. References are  listed. (VM)",

It also considers effects of an accelerated program which together with the use of a semiannual admissions system permit more efficient use of facilities and the instruction of almost twice as many students in a given amount of time than would normally be the case. For the study, data on UTCM were compared with data on all US medical schools, but particularly with the Louisiana State University School of Medicine (LSU), which is located in the same region and has similar applicants, students, curricula and financing levels. Items compared were: ratio of undergraduate medical students to full-time  faculty; expenditures per student in physiology; base salaries of basic science faculty; types of teaching and training grants received; a percentage of full-time faculty receiving 50% or more of their salaries from federal sources; persistence rate; MCAT science scores; and ratio of net square feet occupied to full-time faculty in various departments. Data were obtained through interviews, records searches, and visits to hospitals where UTCM graduates were serving as interns and residents. One of the conclusions was that if relative costs of producing MDs at UTCM and LSU are comparable for all US medical schools, semiannual admissions at all schools would produce 20 to 30% more doctors with no increase in expenditures.

During its first 2 years the role of the Center was conceived to be catalytic and auxiliary to the programs initiated by the various schools and departments at Columbia. By 1970, the Center concluded that to effect lasting change at Columbia the Center must become operational as well as catalytic. This first section of this report describes the history  of the Center and its activities in the University and the community since 1967.

McKeachie thinks that the ultimate purpose of evaluating teaching is to improve learning, and that evaluation of either students or teachers should be based solely on learning. The second article, \"Student Rating of Teaching, Some Questionable Assumptions\" by George L. Fahey, examines some of the assumptions that are made in evaluating teaching effectiveness by means of student ratings and  what these assumptions imply. (AF)",

        "description":"Charles Sanders Peirce, the progenitor of an entire school of philosophy, profoundly influenced our educational system, yet was curiously silent on educational questions. This paper discusses his early upbringing and schooling, and his involvement in education as a lecturer and professor. The major focus is on Peirce's written thoughts on education, which were sparse. The longest of these was in the form of a letter to Daniel Coit Gilman, written January 13, 1878. It expresses Peirce's thoughts on the organization and administration of an academic department, as well as his conviction that in the teaching of science &quot;the professor's object ought to be to let his pupil as much into the interior of scientific thinking as possible, and for that purpose he should make his lecture  experiments resemble real ones as much as possible.&quot; He felt that students who intended to be physicists should be in a laboratory situation from about age 9 to 12 and then return at 18 or 20. Peirce also wrote on mathematical logic and its relation to education, and on the nature of the university. He also gave consideration to teaching mathematics. His thoughts on education were systematic and evolved in the light of his &quot;pragmatic&quot; principles. (AF)",

It was particularly concerned with distinguishing between students who have a predominantly vocational, instrumental approach to college and those who approach college with theoretical, intellectual goals. Of special interest was the discovery whether black students chose black or white friends and referent figures--people in the University community most admired and emulated by the student. Of a total sample of 328 students 277 responded to 3 questionnaires. Interviews were also held with 80 of the low socioeconomic respondents. Among major findings were:  differences in responses of black and white students concerning educational experiences were insufficient to warrant controlling analyses on the basis of race; while white students believed that their college experience had increased their acceptance of blacks, blacks cited increased feelings of antagonism and desire for separatism; the most significant problems experienced by instrumentally oriented black students were academic pressure and the resulting self-analysis, and feelings the system was against them. Problems of intellectually oriented students involved interpersonal relationships; a distinction was made between friends and referent figures. (JS)",

The question investigated was whether eliminating the &quot;better&quot; students from English 1 would have an effect on the grades assigned in the courses--in other words, whether instructors assign grades on the basis of an absolute standard for writing ability or a relative standard based upon the quality of students in the class. An analysis of the grades given in the fall of 1969 in English 1 in the fall of 1970 indicated that there was no statistical difference in the distribution of evaluative grades (A-F). There were similar percentages of A's and B's given in the semesters  before and after the exemption, and the percentage of instructors giving no A's was not significantly different for the 2 semesters. It appears that instructors use a relative rather than an absolute standard of grading. (AF)",

Results showed only a few instances of significant differences--all of them negative--on the 2 rating scales when comparing the difference scores of the faculty groups.

One approach to this issue is the &quot;real student approach&quot; which requires a careful examination of 2 factors and their interaction: (1) the presence of an identifiable group of students who are not now well served; and (2) the existence of continuing education programs and the characteristics of these programs that make them unsuitable for these particular students. Extension and continuing education programs have served 2 important functions of instruction and validation but not of certification (or recognition). This paper examines the problems Sergeant X faces. He is regular Army, plans to retire after 20 years, and  would like to have knowledge necessary for a college job and a college degree. He accumulates &quot;a whole bag of credits and almost credits&quot; through extension and correspondence courses, but because of residency and curriculum requirements and differing quality standards he won't be able to get a degree. The traditional system could be modified in 4 areas: instruction, examination, transfer of credit, and certification to make acquiring a degree a simple matter. The quickest way to accomplish this is through the National University model. (AF)",

The study consisted of: (1) the history and curriculum of the M.A. humanities program; (2) personal and academic backgrounds of the M.A. graduates; (3) the character and quality of the graduate work; (4) post-graduate careers of the M.A. graduates: nonacademic vocations and doctoral study; (5) post-graduate careers of the M.A. graduates: teachers; (6) conclusions. The appendix contains a bibliography and review of recent articles on humanities, careers and interests. The study revealed that the M.A. graduates  preferred an interdisciplinary curriculum over the traditional one-subject approach, and that the M.A. in humanities graduates met or exceeded normal standards for advanced education. The study did not provide comparative data on successful and disqualified candidates. It did, however, present twenty statistical tables comparing the undergraduate and graduate academic achievement of the forty-seven M.A. graduates on the basis of sex. (Author/BHC)",

The initial part of this report describes the method of student selection, procedures for collecting data, and descriptions of all teaching materials and texts used in the experiment, as well as charts and tables comparing final examinations scores and student questionnaire data. A conclusion, which takes into account the Hawthorne Effect as  an independent variable reaffirms the thesis that self-directed intellectual pursuit is, on the whole, a more effective teaching technique. The last section of the report consists of a four-part appendix: (a) the course outline and calendar, required texts, and a syllabus; (b) materials found in the \"learning center\"; (c) the final examination test questions; (d) student opinion questionnaire.

A preliminary study was made of current costs of producing graduates in different disciplines broken down by major items of expenditure (capital and maintenance costs, salaries, administrative costs, etc.). Then, alternative models were constructed corresponding to different sets of assumptions regarding the University of Bradford's: future enrollment policy for new course combinations, staff/student ratios, use of buildings, building costs economics, etc. Data were collected to assess the variation of costs per unit in relation to increased enrollments, and conclusions were tested. Part 1 looks at the nature of university costs from an economist's view. Part 2 treats  cost as an allocation of past expenditures. Part 3 describes a method of building academic staff requirements for a course on the basis of the amount of teaching involved. Part 4 studies the utilization of teaching accommodations. Part 5 is concerned with factors affecting the demand for technical staff. Part 6 examines cost in relation to specific academic development proposals.

The 114 responses represent 48 states and the District of Columbia. It was found that 8 institutions have phased retirement programs--no 2 in the same state. The programs seem about equally divided between public and private institutions, and have operated from 5 to 44 years. The administrative officer of the program varies, but the program seems to apply to both the administrative and instructional staff.

Questionnaires were administered at the beginning and end of students' first year in an innovative and new dental school where they were introduced to clinic experience within the first few months. There was further opportunity for patient exposure at a clinic in an economically depressed area. The analysis focused upon: the students' perceptions of (1) their patients; (2) the dental profession; and (3) themselves. At issue was: whether perceptions and attitudes had changed; to what degree and in what direction the changes had occurred; and what influence clinical experience had exerted in these changes. The findings  were compared with similar studies done at schools where first year students had had not clinical experience. The results indicated that 19 of the 23 subjects had adopted more positive attitudes toward patients, in marked contrast to the results of the other studies. In terms of the profession there was a growing cognizance of reality factors, both positive and negative; and in terms of self-perceptions, the subjects moved rapidly toward a position of viewing self as dentist and feeling more confident and competent in playing professional roles in the clinic.

The following hypotheses and responses are disclosed. It was believed that a non-graded class situation would (1) have a positive effect on the student, (2) improve student-instructor relationships, (3) encourage cooperation among students, (4) result in greater student involvement, and (5) encourage self-initiated reading and creativity. Student evaluation showed a general positive reaction toward the non-graded approach. Specifically, they felt free of tension, unnecessary pressure, and competition for grades. The non-graded course, however, did not increase their interest in the subject matter. Students regarded the instructor  positively and saw him as a helper rather than as a distributor of grades. They did not feel the instructor's effectiveness was diminished. The class as a whole worked together and the students were encouraged to help one another. Feelings toward involvement in class discussion were highly positive. The students also felt encouraged to produce a good paper and to explore new ways of self-expression.

        "description":"Until recently, because of the shortage of instructors, junior colleges set few employment restrictions. Standard qualifications were mastery of subject matter, ability to communicate it, interest in students, and understanding of the college philosophy. As eligible applicants increase, so do questions about employment and certification requirements. Hiring practices have to date shown little concern for teaching proficiency (e.g., causing learning according to defined outcomes), but have generally depended on degrees, etc. This paper questions whether the procedure is non-discriminatory, whether the requirements beyond state credentialing relate directly to job performance. It discusses the possible impact on teacher certification and employment of Griggs vs Duke Power Company.  Although this is an industrial case, subsequent judgments may alter traditional patterns in other areas by bringing an historical pattern in line with prevailing social realities or even beginning a new tradition. The court is unlikely to find credentialing, for instance, inherently discriminatory; the question seems clearly limited to requirements that tend to preserve existing patterns of discrimination or that do not clearly measure the applicant's ability to do the job. (If the courts consider credentials to be only licenses [with no elements of contract], they are outside the scope of Griggs.) Since the basic issue is discrimination in employment, any public agency must therefore justify its hiring practices by showing a rational connection between the requirements and the actual  demands of the job.

It was found that 43 states had developed a state-level agency responsible for coordinating, planning, and in some cases controlling this level of education. The study indicated a decisive trend toward state-level concern for community junior colleges. An increase in state-level planning and financial support seemed to accompany an increase in state-level control and operation. Thirteen states reported that a state board coordinates their community junior colleges; five states coordinate or administer their colleges through a university board, which is also concerned with other institutions of higher education; 14 states use the state department of education as the  locus of responsibility, with usually a special staff or division in charge; and 11 states assign responsibility for community junior colleges to the same board that is responsible for all of higher education.

These are contrasted with those of 4-year institutions using student screening and selection devices, and high schools with their different educational emphasis. It presents the conflict faced by the community college: an institution that is charged with providing instruction to meet the societal needs of all persons over 18, but that must generally operate with a staff-line administrative structure reminiscent of high schools and a curriculum generally paralleling the university's freshman and sophomore years. The Board of Trustee's role is reviewed and its responsibility for producing a favorable atmosphere in which professionals might extend  themselves creatively is emphasized. Actual implementation and support for this thrust of creativity are administrative functions. How to accomplish this goal is suggested in the model for participatory governance. The explanatory organization chart displays the model of governance as participation with directors and divisions in lieu of the more traditional dean system. It is concluded that use of this model increases accountability at all levels, both administrative and instructional. (AL)",

A distinct language barrier between the foreign-born and native-born was evident. Foreign-born quite often looked upon the native-born as offspring of immigrants and of lesser status, considering them inferior because of their inability to speak the ancestral tongue. Native-born, long identified as a minority and with appurtenant parental influences (e.g., relocation camp experiences), reacted strongly to questions on discrimination. Hawaiian-born also had grievances about attitude. They have  experienced prejudice from both native-born and foreign-born: (1) foreign-born ignore them as having a language problem either in English or in the inherited tongue or both; (2) native-born ignore them for having inferior English. Hawaiian-born seem to congregate together, considering the native-born unfriendly and the foreign-born too shy. Special effort was made to contact self-identified students and encourage them to apply for available minority grants. (Author/AL)",

Attrition, paricularly between submission of class requests and attendance past the first weeks of class, is great. The present study attempts to find reasons for this. Questionnaires were sent to 56 to 58 students failing to enroll in or to complete courses in summer 1970; 24 were answered and returned. Of 117 fall 1970 applicants, 99 deliverable questionnaires yielded 43 responses. Most of the respondents interrupted the college-going sequence before attending any classes. Their major reasons were difficulty in adjusting their high-school class schedules, unexpectedly  heavy study or school activity loads, outside job demands, and transportation difficulties. While it is probably inevitable that a noticeable proportion of high school seniors in a program such as this will fail to enroll in or complete the college courses they initially plan to take, it may be possible to reduce the dropout rate somewhat by more careful preparation of the informational bulletin sent them from the college and by devising better means of delivering on to every potential applicant. Scheduling a few more courses transferable to the University of California at 1:00 or 2:00 might help those with high-schhol schedule conflicts. (AL)",

An analysis of their grade point average (GPA) term by term reveals a drop in GPA the first term after transfer and subsequent recovery. This phenomenon, known as &quot;transfer shock,&quot; is compared with results obtained in national studies. An attempt to develop a multiple-variable regression equation for the prediction of success after transfer by use of a multiple stepwise regression revealed that, after using the GPA at the junior college as the first variable, additional variables were not significant. The study indicates that ACT scores and high school rank are significant predictors of success in a college transfer program at a junior college, but, after two  years, the junior college GPA is the only significant predictor of success in the upper-level universities. This finding has many implications for the admission policies of junior college transfer students to 4-year institutions. (Author/MN)",

If the use and size of government documents could be stabilized at present levels, then the expertise of a documents librarian, without the device of separation, should prove sufficient.

Incorporation of the Seminars was approved in the District of Columbia in January 1968. Efforts were made for tax exempt and tax deduction status so that grants and contracts to carry out certain activities of interest to it requiring funds beyond the membership fee could be accepted.

Development is extended to encompass related problems involved in the creation of a book catalog. A model to study the effects of congestion at the catalog is created. Using a drawer chosen randomly from either a dictionary catalog, or the subject or author-title part of a split catalog, three measures of congestion are considered: (1) the probability that the drawer is being used, (2) the average time needed to wait for a use and (3) the average number of people attracted to the drawer at any time. All the parameters used and the basic relations among them are collected in Section II. The first  measure of congestion considered is the likelihood that a user must wait before he can use a drawer. The next measure of congestion is the mean time a user must wait to gain access to a drawer. The final measure of congestion is the number of people contributed to the system at any time along each drawer. Section VI considers the implications of the model for the construction of book catalogs. It was found that each of the three criteria of congestion can lead to a different conclusion. (Author/NH)",

Yet many people who would put the information to work know little or nothing about the tools for getting it. This book attempts to draw together available information about getting and using public data. It is keyed to the needs of both the social activist and his lawyer. Part 1: How to get the information is primarily for the social activist and researcher, offering fairly simple, practical advice about gathering information. Part 2: How to use the information offers some practical illustrations from cases in the major controversial fields of education, employment, and transportation. Part 3: Source materials on information laws provides references  to all major statutes. The full text of the federal act is included. After reading this book citizens should consult public interest law firms, neighborhood legal services, and civil liberties lawyers regarding what can be done under the law in these areas.

The instrument employed in the analysis was a mail questionnaire addressed to administrators of the four discrete types of libraries: academic library, public library, school library and special library. In this study of the academic library administrator, from a universe made up of academic institutions with student bodies of 3000 or more, a total of 161 administrators responded to the questionnaires. Full details of sample choice and design and an analysis of the sample are contained in the Appendixes of this  report. It was concluded that to realistically assess the prospects for change in academic libraries is to expect only the most minimal in the way of basic modification in the foreseeable future. For there is at present no clear and unambiguous mandate for innovation which has yet captured the imagination or provoked the conscience of the administrative class in academic librarianship.

A total of 102 administrators responded to the questionnaire. Full details of sample choice and design and an analysis of the returns are contained in the Appendix. A primary concern was to discern where and how and whether change was taking place in the organizations, and insofar as possible, to perceive the degree and the mechanisms by which the librarians who responded to the study instruments provided impetus for such change. It was concluded that the typical public library director is sincerely concerned with advancing the public library. Yet expressed dissatisfaction with the existing order and even a disposition toward alternatives to the  conventional scheme of things do not equate with a propensity to change things. And the evidence of this study reveals an administrative class whose personal characteristics, attitudes of mind, and value assumptions strongly militate against the assumption of a change agent role.

Full detail of sample choice and design and an analysis of the returns are contained in the Appendix. It was concluded that, unlike the other administrative groups, the school library supervisor is clearly oriented toward a single direction for change--the multimedia concept. The conventional wisdom of school librarianship appears to equate progress with more comprehensive control of nonbooks as well as books--to swell the inventory, and so to add films, records and  tapes. To the degree that professional perspectives remain absorbed in expanding collections, more zeal inevitably attends the collecting function than motivates expansion of service to clients.

Ninety-five respondents completed and returned the questionnaires. Full details of sample choice and design and an analysis of the returns are contained in the Appendixes. With regard to the special library it was concluded that instead of the concentration on physical plant and collection development so evident in the other library situations, change phenomena in the special library involved the new technology including client-oriented computer applications, advances in the use of micro-reproduction, and participation in sophisticated network designs. There was a greater propensity to focus upon  client requirements and satisfactions as the basic measure of the library contribution. And yet, this administrative class presents no model of active, impatient leadership committed to a reconstitution of library and information services. The evidence of this study revealed no urgency to shift from prevailing practice, to reassess and to reshape the basic philosophy of the field in order to influence change in the nature of the services, in clientele priorities, or in service orientation.

Attention was directed to the ways in which the educational institutions who prepare these entrants are responding to the challenges which are being presented them by the increasing demands for information in the society and the technological advances in the handling of it. The methods employed in the study included both a mail survey of students and faculty in all the ALA accredited library schools in the U.S.A. and Canada, and visits to a majority of the schools by the investigators. During the visits, interviews and discussions were conducted with both students and faculty members. Both students and faculty expressed the  need for changes in current library school programs, but the major ones they desire are of a technological and applied character rather than in the intellectual aspects of the curriculum. Thus, although the needs for reform are recognized, the likelihood of any early changes in either curriculum or organization is not anticipated, and the programs are likely to face increasing competition from those in other parts of the university.

Of the 14 schools who replied to the questionnaire, nine arranged field work and five did not. The degree of organization and supervision of field work felt to be possible and desirable varied considerably. The survey of  libraries showed that many which were already cooperating with schools were willing to take more students and others were waiting to be asked to help for the first time.

The sessions have been designed to help a group acquire: increased sensitivity to the major factors involved  in the discussion process; understand the importance and value of group discussion methods; develop skill in diagnosing the problems which a group leader may handle; acquire experience in leading discussion, in order to build leadership skills; and understand the role of skillful interpersonal relations as a technique for bridging the gap between the \"passivity\" of discussion and the activism of community involvement.

It is the purpose of this publication to assert that a \"bold new approach\" to the evaluation of library service is needed in order to exert leadership in the patterns of citizens involvement and local control. The core of the problem includes these imperatives: to integrate library service with the community; to focus attention upon the imperatives of a right to read and new careers; to make the full range of information and communicative help which the community has to offer  readily available to persons in need; to increase the likelihood that concerns can be identified and help provided early enough to do some good; to strengthen the service program of the community library for the prevention of information dislocation. The citizens themselves should ultimately be involved in determining the kind of information programs they get. Without a situation-producing theory of communications, it is unlikely that librarians will ever produce the strategies for community leadership. (Author)",

It was hypothesized that (1) Kindergarteners who possess feelings of internal reinforcement control would change positively in achievement striving in relation to the ratio of teacher's approval over disapproval for achievement behavior and (2) There would be no consistent relationships between independent and dependent variables for children who have not yet developed an adequate feeling of internal reinforcement control. Forty-five boys selected from four kindergarten classes and two teachers were observed over a 4-week period in the classroom. The data collected on independent and dependent  variables supported the first hypothesis. The second hypothesis was partly supported: (a) achievement striving decreased as teachers' approval of achievement efforts increased for all of the children who were low on internal reinforcement control, (b) children low on internal reinforcement control did not show less achievement striving than those judged high, and (c) children rated high on dependency did show less achievement striving. This study suggests that kindergarten teachers may be able to assist pupils in the development of achievement striving by providing opportunities for successful and important achievement efforts and accompanying these with social approval.

Association values for each word were calculated, providing a hierarchy with significant differences between the 10 high and 10 low terms, but little dependable difference between adjacent items. No significant difference in association value could be attributed to sex, SES, or race, but age-related differences were found.  Data were also analyzed in terms of semantic, syntactic and phonological components. In the syntactic and phonological analyses, major differences were also age-related. Four-year-olds failed to respond significantly more frequently than 6-year-olds, and produced the lowest number of both verbs and abstract nouns. While advantaged children produced a significantly larger number of abstract nouns than disadvantaged children, there was no support for the Bernstein hypothesis that disadvantaged children demonstrate restricted use of adjectives and adverbs.

One trouble spot in methodology is the use of a square data matrix with an insufficient number of observations in proportion to variables. A second methodological problem arises from a failure to use the best tools available to determine reliabilities of experimental tests. Another concern is the theoretical problems involved in film test research. Although test authors may define a trait, the designing of a test to measure that trait is not always successful. The final concern relates to the problems of human perception. Care needs to be taken that the observer can see a stimulus nonperipherally in the  experimental situation. In short, while the findings of film tests studies remain as interesting as ever, their role in discrimination and prediction will increase only after their practical utility is established. (WY)",

        "description":"Hazards in infant care may occur in an institution, day care setting or family day care home whenever caretakers disregard the individual needs of infants. Whether group care of infants becomes a mental health hazard or a resource depends upon several factors. In such situations, an infant may fail to establish the close ties with a single mothering person basic to the development of trust and dependability. Adequate protection for the infant from accidents and infection presents another hazard. Another consideration is that a baby can be bombarded with too much stimuli. Also, in a group setting, a baby may lack exposure to sufficient and appropriate toys. If caretakers are too busy or preoccupied to respond to the infant's first babblings, his language may not develop  adequately. When there are too few caretakers to provide physical contact, cuddling, and playtime, the infant's growth and learning may be delayed. However, when the caretaker recognizes the individual need of each child and tailors a varied and interesting program to him, healthy development can result. Parents, too, may benefit from education and support in their task of raising children. (WY)",

This paper presents a summary of three recent experiments offering affirmative answers to the question. A fourth experiment provides evidence that at least under some circumstances, children's interpersonal aggression may be increased by witnessing symbolic aggressive models. Subjects were 136 boys and girls randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. Individual children in each group watched a videotape of either a violent or a highly active sports sequence. Subjects were next escorted to an adjacent room and seated at a response box apparatus.  By pressing either of two buttons, children communicated their intent to help or hurt another child. As in many earlier studies, subjects regularly exposed to symbolic aggressive models tended to respond more aggressively than control group subjects tested under identical circumstances. Further, this pattern of results emerged despite the brevity of the aggressive sequences and, in three of four experiments, such effects were found even in the absence of a strong prior instigation to aggression.

In being cognizant of these domains, the researcher is able to distinguish the parts of a content area which are subject to different instructional treatment. He becomes better able to relate the instructional procedures of one subject to those of another. Also, in identifying domains of learning, he recognizes that each requires different techniques for assessment of learning outcomes. Although the five domains are the primary categories which limit the generalizability of conclusions about the learning process, other very obvious characteristics impose limitations as well. Sex  and race have been extensively analyzed as have environmental and cultural differences. Age deserves further consideration to show not only what the differences in learning are but why they may be expected to occur. Because the process of learning for a student at one age is likely to be very different from that of a student of another age, differential plans for different ages becomes of critical importance. Clear thinking about the process of learning will be enhanced when researchers recognize necessary distinctions about learning that define the limits within which generalizations can and should be made.

These children are compared with working class 2-year-old children being raised in two-parent homes in which the mother is not working full-time and there are no older siblings of preschool age. All children were observed within 2 weeks of their second birthday. Each child was assessed in his own living room on these items: (1) response to strangers, (2) response to separation from mother or nurse, (3) mother's enumeration of child's attachment to various persons, (4) behavior patterns such as thumbsucking, nailbiting, (5) emotional involvement of mother or nurser, (6) assessment of child's experiences, (7) number of caretakers, and (8) number of  child contacts. The children living at home were significantly more friendly than the nursery children. Home-reared children displayed attachment behavior towards a select circle of individuals, while the nursery children generally showed attachment to anyone who spent time with them. Although the nursery children are in contact with more adults, the home children meet adults in a greater variety of situations. The home children more frequently visited cafes, shops, rode in cars and buses; and nursery children more often were read and sung to, played with sand, dough, paints, and wheeled toys. No evidence of marked behavioral disturbance was seen in either group. (AJ)",

Selection of subjects was made on the basis of quantity of verbal behavior and amount and quality of classroom play. In a 15-minute dyad play situation which maximized the opportunity for dramatic play, children who dispensed social rewards at a relatively high rate were paired with those children who received and dispensed rewards at a low rate. Observers recorded 9-minute samples of the occurrence or non-occurrence of cooperative, parallel or solitary play, and verbal interactions initiated by or directed toward the subjects. The results are charted for four dyads. Ongoing work with isolated children has indicated  that as a child becomes the recipient of positive reinforcement from his peers, the child's classroom behavior changes, and increases in both verbal interaction with others and cooperative play occur. Findings suggest that teachers may restructure classroom groups to counteract environmental factors that maintain the behavior of the isolate child. (Author/AJ)",

The curriculum was developed in an inner city industry-based day care center with 14 infants aged 8 to 19 months initially. The Hunt-Uzgiris Scales measuring development in these areas, the Development of Schemas in Relation to Objects, and the Development of Vocal and Gestural Imitation, were administered to each infant. Procedures were developed which emphasized activities at the infant's level of development while introducing experiences at the next developmental level and repeating previous activities. These procedures were developed and carried out 2 half days per week during 4 semesters. Continuous written  observations and several video tapes were made of instructional procedures and infant responses. The observational data indicate that during the course of a semester each infant progressed a minimum of one step along a scale and was capable of mastering a wide range of experiences at each step. Thus, the Hunt-Uzgiris Scales provided a reasonable starting point for the development of a set of intensive and coherent experiences at each developmental level. (Author/AJ)",

It was hypothesized that high divergent subjects would score higher under the inductive-guided discovery strategy than under the deductive-reception strategy while the opposite would be true for the low divergent students. Subjects were 128 fourth, fifth and sixth grade subjects who had scored over 100 on a Lorge-Thorndike IQ test. Verbal Form A of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking was used to determine the levels of children's creative thinking. The pupils were assigned to either an inductive-guided discovery instructional strategy group or a deductive-reception instructional strategy group. Initial  subject matter was familiar. A test of acquisition was given after a 20-day experimental period; a test of retention 20 days after the first test. Data was analyzed by multiple regression analysis used and analysis of covariance was computed to test the differences by treatment in the criterion tests. Conclusions were: (1) levels of divergent production as measured by the verbal test of Torrance were not related to children's initial learning or retention or mathematical generalizations no matter what the style of presentation; and (2) for the learning of low cognitive mathematical material, the deductive-reception strategy proved superior to the inductive-guided discovery strategy. Statistical tables are included. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"According to a recent census, over 46 percent of all American women today are employed outside the home. A growing number of these women and their families are turning to daycare programs for assistance in caring for their children. Researchers find that parents want decision-making roles in the programs which affect their children; they want to help establish the criteria to be met by the staff; they want to influence or control the hiring and firing of staff. Parents are particularly concerned that males, including teenagers and grandparents, be included on the staff. There is a strong concern to establish continuity between the home and the center through the parent's involvement in the child's educational activities in the home and at the center. A broad concept of parent  participation is needed and examples and practical suggestions are given for effectively involving parents in all aspects of daycare. Exemplary programs are described extensively. A comprehensive reference list and four appendixes supplement the main work. The first appendix provides a list of concerns voiced by parents; another includes the parent involvement questionnaire; a third appendix provides brief abstracts of several interesting programs which were not discussed in the body of the study. The fourth appendix, an address list, is provided for readers who wish to obtain a more comprehensive, sophisticated and updated understanding of individual programs. (Author/MK)",

However, a number of people have found it useful for other purposes. Teachers who are attempting to use the \"natural method\" of accelerating language development find it helpful in giving children a language lift. The teacher listens to the child and notes the immature syntactical structures used. She then deliberately models the correct syntax and encourages the child to use it by asking him a question; the child's response to this question demands use of the structure. This list of syntactical structures may help the teacher become more aware of which structures are developing during the preschool years and how  to help disadvantaged children acquire them.

An experimental group of 31 Negro male infants and a control group of 33 Negro male infants were selected from door-to-door surveys of two lower-socioeconomic neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. Tutors visited the home of each experimental infant for an hour a day, five days a week, beginning when the infant reached 15 months of age and continuing through 36 months. Participation of the mother was encouraged but not required. Tutors were carefully selected and specially trained to make maximum use of teaching materials such as toys, books, music and rhythm, puzzles, games, and to provide  children with the experiences of walks and excursions. Pleasant interpersonal relationships were encouraged and maintained at all levels of the project. Posttest gains confirm the success of the program for the experimental infants. However, it is suggested that tutoring should begin before 14 months of age. Four generalizations about the educational process in relation ot program development are also made. (WY)",

One experimental group had Montessori preschool experience; the other, Head Start. Two control groups had conventional public classroom experience. One control group had experienced Head Start; the other had no formal preschool education. In a multiple-assessment procedure, children were measured according to ability(1) to create novel solutions to a maze puzzle; (2) to match appropriate objects among a sample of 3; (3)  to separate an item from the field or context of which it is a part; (4) to control and restrain impulse action (Draw-a-Line-Slowly); (5) to repeat sentences (WPPSI); and (6) to initiate investigative behavior (curiosity measures.) Findings indicated that the non-graded primary combined with preschool experience showed the best results; subtracting either preschool or non-graded practices reduced the progress of the children.

To this commission, he delegated the responsibility of making a comprehensive study and appraisal of the current economic situations and trends in American rural life. In fulfilling this responsibility, the National Advisory Commission on Rural Poverty conducted public hearings in Tucson, Arizona; Memphis, Tennessee; and Washington, D.C. The verbatim transcript contained in this volume is a result of the 3-day public hearing in Washington, D.C., on Febraury 15-17, 1967. Two additional volumes contain the proceedings of the hearings in Tucson (RC 001 975) and Memphis (RC 001 945). All 3 volumes of hearings conducted by this commission are verbatim transcripts of the  respective hearing proceedings. Based upon these public hearings and other extensive research, the commission presented a final report to President Johnson on September 27, 1967. The final report, which is contained in another volume (ED 016 543), describes the poverty in America in 1967 and recommends \"the most efficient and promising means of providing opportunities for the rural population to share in America's abundance.\" (LS)",

After an evaluation of the state of these 3 conditions in community action programs in Appalachia, it is concluded that the conditions are unattained and it is recommended that the development of adequate community action leadership at the local level be given top priority &quot;since the other 2  conditions probably must be taken as 'givens' until the development of effective leadership is accomplished.&quot; (BO)",

The data from 140 relocatees are presented in a post-factum analysis but reveal that opportunity structures that avoid social impediments to raising status are more important to this group than those removing economic barriers. Furthermore, most of those who stayed on their new jobs and most of those who  left felt that they were better off in the receiving community.

It is generally agreed that about 10 million rural people are poor and that they constitute one-third of the nation's economically disadvantaged. The paramount cause of present urban problems stems from the migration of hordes of economically and socially deprived and displaced persons from rural areas to urban centers. The vast majority of states having large rural populations have fewer fiscal resources per child to support educational programs than the average state. Multi-district organizations are providing some of the answers to rural education problems due to scarcity of population, small school districts, geographical  isolation, and an inadequate tax base. The primary challenge in rural education is to drastically improve the quality of its educational offerings and to make education relevant for those who will remain in the community and for those who will migrate to urban areas. In the document, rural education is discussed in terms of the foregoing factors; national organizations concerned with rural education are cited; 9 regional and state education improvement projects are described; and recommendations to correct deficiencies in rural education for the 1970's are listed.

        "description":"In 1970, many Americans are examining anew the costs of achieving efficiency in agriculture through bigness. The exodus of small farmers continues--more than 2.7 million farmers have abandoned farming or sold out to bigger competitors since 1950--while Government agricultural policy remains attuned to the interests of large farmers. All small farmers have suffered from Government policy, but black farmers have been the chief victims. Agriculture is still one of the nation's largest employers, and farm work remains one of the most hazardous occupations. One-fourth of farm-wage workers are under 16 years of age; most children of farm workers suffer serious educational disadvantages; poor health, squalid housing, and powerlessness continue to be the lot of migrant workers; Federal  Programs for migrants lack adequate funding and are often administered by state and local bodies unresponsive to migrant needs; and Congress has refused again to include farm workers in unemployment compensation coverage. One improvement, however, is the 1970 Housing Act which provides an increase in the maximum grant for construction of farm labor housing. Nontheless, progress in farm labor conditions has come primarily from the efforts of the poor themselves in organizing small farm cooperatives, self-help projects, and unions.

This divergence is particularly marked in more urban regions, such as California, and among tribes where some of the reservations are near cities. As tribalism has become less important and urban adaptation more important, cities have a differential impact for change according to their distance from the various Indian communities. The most distant reservations tend to be abandoned, to survive as retirement communities, or to turn to a conservative, low-cost-of-living and welfare-dependent adaptation. Reservations closest to the cities tend to develop a pattern wherein residents commute to jobs in the city; these reservations are  characterized by population increase and a new sophistication in working with modern bureaucratic politics.

The rural community resists widespread effort to change existing conditions since rural people are generally conservative and often do not have the financial resources to solve indigenous problems. Although local boards of education are delegated the authority to determine educational policy, they rarely make decisions that might raise the ire of the local power structure. To a large degree, local educational programs are determined by the attitudes of local administrators, teachers, school board members, parents, and other adults in the community. Most administrators and  teachers in rural areas are themselves products of the rural subculture and reflect the attitudes of the community in which they work. Education continues to be viewed as an expense rather than an investment, with the school being an agency for passing on the eternal verities rather than an agency for social change. The recent move toward the educational cooperative and an emphasis in administrator and teacher preparation programs on educational change and innovation are seen as constructive efforts to improve rural schools.

The handbook discusses major educational needs of Choctaw children,  what teachers and aides need to know about language, and how the program can meet the needs of Choctaw bilingual children. Reference is made to materials available for the classroom, materials available for inservice training, and techniques in bilingual education. Appended is a list of terms, with definitions, commonly used in the study of language. (JH)",

Sociocultural conditions of the migrants are also examined: the strength and disadvantagement of the migrant worker and family (4pp. of testimony presented by a psychiatrist at Harvard University); ethnic origin and languages spoken; health problems; inadequate education; the power of crew leaders and instances of its abuse; substandard housing; and major health hazards. Various programs (day-care centers, adult and child  education, health and legal services, etc.) provided by public and private agencies directly concerned with meeting the needs of migrants, along with supportive Federal legislation, are discussed; however, it is noted that &quot;in spite of these various programs and services, the seasonal farm laborers, by and large, still suffer from low wages, substandard housing, poor education and lack of adequate health services.&quot; No recommendations are offered in the report.

As major inroads are now being made into infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and many chronic illnesses, the problems of the mental health of Indians come into a more central focus. Within the framework of mental health problems, suicide looms as one of the more tragic outcomes of psychological anguish. At the same time, it is one of the most preventable and unnecessary modes of death. The long history of social and cultural turmoil that has confronted the American Indian has created unique problems, and one of the outcomes is an increase in suicide and other self-destructive behavior. It was within this context that the National Institute of Mental  Health and the Division of Indian Health (now Indian Health Service) worked cooperatively to sponsor the workshops at which the following papers (reproduced in the document) were presented: \"Suicide in the United States,\"\"Self-Destructive Behavior in Adolescents and Adults: Similarities and Differences,\"\"Two Types of Suicidal Behavior,\"\"Planning for Suicide Prevention,\"\"Mental Health Services in a Sparsely Populated Area: A Necessary Complement to a Suicide Prevention Program,\"\"Suicide and Self-Destructive Behavior in the Oglala Sioux: Some Clinical Aspects and Community Approaches,\" and \"Suicide and Self-Destructive Behavior on the Cheyenne River Reservation.\" (BO)",

However, the relationship between perception and reading has not been clarified. Tests of visual perception often focus on skills such as copying geometric designs which have little or nothing to do with reading skills or readiness. Researchers have investigated the use of auditory analysis skills tests in predicting reading abilities. The purpose of these tests is to show whether the child is able to sort out and organize sounds in words. Data has indicated that the auditory analysis tests were a good predictor of reading skills in first-grade children. Since the development of perceptual skills occurs primarily in early childhood, different sociological backgrounds will provide  different perceptual experiences for the preschool child. And because reading success is dependent on a child's familiarity with Standard English sounds, exposure to such sounds should be a part of early school training preparing the child to read. (AL)",

Forty seventh-grade remedial reading students were given the Spache Reading Scales and the Triggs Diagnostic Reading Test. Lorge-Thorndike group intelligence test scores were intercorrelated with the comprehension scores. Of the ten intercorrelations among the four comprehension subtests and IQ scores, four were significant at the .05 level or greater. The range of the partial correlations was from -.21 to .15. The  variance accounted for by verbal comprehension ranged from -.04 to .03; other factors accounted for variation from .01 to .20. Triggs and IQ scores correlated highly at .50, but since a .39 correlation between IQ and Spache silent scores which demand immediate recall was also found, it was concluded that the third question was not satisfactorily answered.

The author maintains that kinesthetic methods are more appropriate for teaching boys than the visual-auditory approach used for both boys and girls now. By presenting data from various studies which indicate that the larger numbers of juvenile delinquents and retarded readers in elementary grades are boys, the author argues that boys are being feminized by our current educational system. It is further stated that proprioceptor functions, related to motor patterns controlled in  the lower brain centers, can act to (1) destroy previous learning; (2) rebuild capacity in the integrative process where brain tissue has been destroyed; (3) develop perceptual abilities as in the case of nonreaders; (4) incorporate individuals, groups, objects, and locations as extensions of ourselves; (5) circumvent higher brain functions; and (6) distort integrative functions resulting in emotional and behavioral problems.

Secondary science education students scored significantly higher than students enrolled in primary or intermediate education. The difference between the means of the secondary science students and the primary and intermediate groups was statistically significant at greater than 0.01, supporting the premise that secondary education students majoring in science do possess more understanding of the nature and processes of science, as measured by the WISP. Little relationship was identified between sex, number of university science courses and years of high school science and  knowledge of the nature and processes of science. A relationship between the average grade of science courses taken at the university level and the WISP score was significant at the .01 level. Three areas (scientific observations, experimentation, and communication of scientific knowledge) seemed to be well understood by over 90 per cent of the students. (BB)",

The content of the course included modern algebraic and geometric concepts. Both classes were taught by the same instructor and studied from the same set of understanding of the interdependence of all segments of the total environment. allotment: review lecture (5 minutes), class discussion (10 minutes), new material lecture (10 minutes), and class discussion (25 minutes). The \"small-group\" class used this allotment: review and new material lecture (10 minutes), small-group discussion (30 minutes), and class discussion (10 minutes). The size of the discussion groups alternated weekly between three and four students. Group  composition was randomly determined. Group leadership was rotated daily. The following measures were analyzed: (1) computational skills, (2) achievement on examinations of independent reading ability in mathematics, (3) attitude toward mathematics, and (4) overall course achievement. The differences which were analyzed and found to be significant included: (1) the post-test measure of computational skills for the small-group class was better (.05) than the pretest measure, (2) the independent reading measure for the upper half of the small-group was better (.01) than that of the upper half of the lecture class. Other differences found between criterion measures were not significant. (Author/RS)",

Intended primarily for public health nurses and sanitarians with a college degree or its equivalent, the guide is designed to be used when the need to compute and use the arithmetic mean arises. Several computational procedures for finding the arithmetic mean are provided, each with accompanying  step-by-step examples. These include procedures for: ungrouped, discrete data; ungrouped continuous data; grouped (single value), discrete data; grouped (interval), discrete data; grouped (single value), continuous data; grouped (interval), continuous data (rounded); and grouped (interval), continuous data (non-rounded).

The second paper: \"A Theory of Mathematical Knowledge\" defends the thesis that rules are the basic building blocks of mathematical knowledge. These rules operate at different levels, for example: addition and subraction at one level, the idea of inverse operations at a higher level. Mathematical creativity then consists of combining rules to produce new results. The third paper: \"Deterministic Theorizing in Structural Learning\" describes experiments based on this hypothesis, in which a subject's performance on certain tasks is predicted with virtual certainty from  his performance on the component rules. The role of the memory is also discussed, and experiments are described supporting the view of the mind as an information processor with a fixed capacity. The fourth paper: \"A Research Basis for Teacher Education\" argues that teachers need to know more of the aims of the mathematics they teach, more of the way mathematical knowledge is structured, and more of the way students learn. The author's research on structural learning (as described in the second and third papers) is then summarized, and possible developments are outlined. (MM)",

The need by private industry and electric utilities for scientists and engineers with degrees in disciplines other than nuclear science or engineering, as well as for technicians, nuclear reactor operators, and nuclear materials managers is projected. The hiring practices of industries and utilities are related to the education received by the scientists and engineers required. The extrinsic and intrinsic factors used by companies and utilities active in the atomic energy field in developing technical manpower forecasts, the educational backgrounds of currently employed technical personnel, the level of degree work of these individuals,  and the company and utility activities where the majority of the technical personnel work were identified. The results indicate a projected surplus of nuclear scientists or engineers, especially those with PhD's. A critical shortage of engineering talent is foreseen in the fields of mechanical and electrical/electronics engineering, as well as at the technician level. (Author/TS)",

The consequence of these interactions is Change and it is this \"Process of Change\" which is the central theme of the program. This unified program is now in the third year in which all science taught at this school is part of the program. The evidence available at this point, both subjective and objective, indicates that a totally unified approach to science education at the secondary school level is practical and that this approach represents a more effective means of realizing the educational objectives established for  the science program, at this high school, than was being achieved by the same staff working through a subject-oriented program.

These programs are in elementary arithmetic, initial reading, and computer programing for high school students. The second section, the major part of this paper, reports a detailed evaluation of these programs. Two criteria for successful performance are examined: simple achievement gain, and reduction of achievement inequality. The final section deals with the problem of making CAI available in rural as well as urban areas, and attempts a realistic assessment of the total costs. An estimate  is also made of the increase in student to teacher ratio required to provide CAI without an increase in expenditure per student. (MM)",

A questionnaire (appended) was mailed to political science department chairmen of 833 colleges and universities; the study is based on the responses of 562 chairmen. The questionnaires contained three sets of questions directly relevant to the basic purpose of the study: 1) the extent to which their introductory course in political science included treatment of State and local government; 2) the approximate proportion of lecture time and course-related reading allocated to these fields in the introductory course; and, 3) the number  of intermediate and advanced courses in State and local government and intergovernmental relations offered by their department. The survey's findings lead to an inescapable conclusion that the fields in question receive second-rate treatment in today's college and university political science curricula.

Data for this study were obtained for six separate samples of elementary school students in the individually prescribed instruction project from grades 2 through 6 studying in six different units in arithmetic; sample size varied from 42 to 182. The analyses were carried out in three steps: 1) the correlation between aptitude and rate of learning using two measures previous year rate of learning, and non-verbal I.Q.  using Lorge-Thorndike: four rate measures were included as described by Wang (1968); 2) examination of the effectiveness of each aptitude measure as predictors of a composite rate measure; and, 3) examination of the other variables using the two measures in step one plus aptitude measures of mathematics achievement using the Stanford Achievement Tests and Lorge-Thorndike. Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the composite contribution of these measures of Carroll's variables to each of the four learning rate measures. The three analyses substantiated the hypothesis that there is no simple relationship between pupil aptitude and rate of learning. (Author/SBE)",

The unit problem-What role do geographic factors play in the development of cities in the Soviet Union as centers for political, economic, and cultural activities as compared to other cities throughout the world--is investigated through ten individualized, flexibly designed lessons. Broad generalizations for the unit are: 1) geographic surroundings influence the location and development of cities; 2) national cultural forces help determine the importance of population centers; 3) cities evolve as a result of the basic interdependence of people and serve as their center of culture,  industry, and government; and, 4) sustenance and revitalization of the city are the responsibility of every citizen. A number of skills are expected to develop as a result of this learning experience. Among them: 1) formulating and proving hypothesis; 2) conducting research; 3) using and developing maps; and, 4) gathering data from non-book materials. Transparencies, tapes, and films are integral to the lessons, and learning activities include simulation, small group discussions, and games. An appendix lists the suggested audio-visual materials and their sources. (JLB)",

        "description":"The task of social theory and especially of general social dynamics is to perceive patterns and regularities in our image of the four dimensional structure consisting of all human beings as they occupy three dimensions of space and one of time. Although the existing divisions of the social sciences exist for good historical reasons, there is a conceptual scheme for the study of the social system with the social sciences broken differently. The critical question, however, is whether it is possible in the next 50 years to mobilize an intellectual resource behind the problem of developing a general interdisciplinary social science. To parallel this there is the possibility that an amalgamation of history and geography would provide more refined study and improvement of the record of  the space-time continuum. (Author/VLW)",

        "description":"The essentially descriptive study of these two racially and culturally distinct populations started with Robert E. Park's conception of social distance as the degree of understanding and intimacy which characterizes personal and social relations. The social distance phenomenon was broken down into three levels of analysis: perceived socio-economic status, attitudes of perference for association, and frequency and intimacy of interaction between members of groups. Based on historical background and contemporary intergroup relations theory, six hypotheses were presented to be tested. Two probability samples of twenty-five respondents each were selected. Similar interviews employing both attitude measurement techniques based on the conceptualization of social distance and questions  requiring more qualitative responses were administered. Participant observations were also compiled. Although statistical associations were somewhat low, the results generally indicated that among the whites sampled racial characteristics (visible physical differences) were the most salient cues to social distance attitudes expressed. Frequency and intimacy of contact were most highly associated with Indian social distance attitudes. These findings led to a discussion of cultural and socio-economic factors which differentiate the white and Indian populations studied. The conclusion was that relations between whites and Indians are stalemated at a stage of accommodation in terms of Park's race relations cycle. (Author)",

        "description":"In February 1968, the Social Studies Implementation Project began as a cooperative venture involving twenty-three school districts in metropolitan St. Louis. The overall objective of the project was to operate a model which was designed to overcome the problems of curriculum implementation. Operationally, the project had several objectives: 1) to create four field stations; 2) to carry out a three-year four-stage implementation process in each field station: analysis and selection of curricula; strategy and lesson development requiring the utilization of new curriculum; field testing new materials in a field station school; and, diffusion of the materials from the field school to radial schools; 3) to produce a group of teachers who have mastered and accepted this implementation  process; 4) to alter patterns of school curriculum decision making by placing project personnel in key role or encouraging adoption; and, 5) disseminate the curricula. They developed a six-phase evaluation of the model akin to a field study including both formative and summative evaluation. The sources of data were: field observer notes, progress reports, data from participants, third-party reports from studies of the project by graduate students, and interviews of participant teachers. Three formal data collection instruments were used: a measure of role strain, semantic differential, and a measure of decision making criteria. The only positive outcomes were: acceptance of the model, the development of curriculum analysis skills, and the dissemination of the materials.  (Author/SBE)",

        "description":"This paper reports the author's research on the relative impact of various communication structures, particularly the mass media, on the formation of attitudes regarding war and peace, and the relationship of these source ratings to age and sex. The sample consisted of 611 randomly selected public school students from grades 5, 7, 10, and 12 in Vancouver, Canada. Methodology involved the administration of a series of open-ended questions measuring the individual's orientations to several different war-peace concepts, and the amount of influence each of a variety of potential sources had on each orientation. Six-point scales were utilized to examine the influence of: family members, friends, home TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, books, movies, teachers, textbooks, school movies,  school TV, minister, and content of religion. Among other findings reported were: 1) ratings of the utility of various sources tend to differ mainly between the concepts of the word war and the causes of war, on the one hand, and the remaining concepts on the other; 2) TV at home has the highest utility for all concepts; and, 3) in the upper grades, TV at home is only of secondary importance for several concepts, magazines and newspapers assuming greater influence. The author states that there is a need for further research on why certain sources are of more utility than others for certain orientations. (JLB)",

        "description":"This study presents a theoretical approach to the study of the emergence of movements for political change. It was postulated that changes outside the university role set --industrial systems development, political, military, scientific competition between the United States and Soviet Union-- brought about the following structural changes within the American university: 1) an increasing involvement of the university in national decisions; 2) an increase in the size of the student body; 3) an increase in the heterogeneity of the student body; 4) an increase in the duration of the student role; and, 5) an increase in the necessity to attend college. The structural changes were used to explain changes in the political expectations and activity of students: 1) rejection of  traditional authority in student affairs; 2) desire for voice in decisions making; and, 3) rejection of the concept or image of students as immature citizens. Aggregate data on the structural variables were gathered from national statistical sources and from the archives of the two schools. Data on student expectations and patterns of political activity were gathered from a content analysis of the school papers: The Crimson and the Daily Cardinal. It was found that gradual structural changes started in the forties, were accentuated in the fifties, then followed by abrupt simultaneous changes in student expectations and activity in the sixties; this constituted a genuine student movement for political change.

        "description":"This report, prepared by the Academic Games program of the Center, investigates the effects of the game Democracy on the political attitudes of junior high school students through two studies. The game focuses on the process of log-rolling, which the players, assuming the role of congressmen, quickly discover to be the most effective way to satisfy their simulated constituencies. Both studies were designed to test the same four hypotheses: 1) playing Democracy will cause students to be less disapproving of congressional log-rolling; 2) playing the game will increase students' feelings of political efficacy; 3) playing Democracy will increase the students' interest in politics and the legislative process; and, 4) the previously mentioned changes in attitude will be positively  correlated with understanding of the game. The subjects were 8th and 9th grade students from neighboring schools near Baltimore. Measurement instruments were the same for the two studies. The results of both studies clearly support the first hypothesis. The results for the second hypothesis were not so clear--in both studies the differences are in the projected direction, but in one study they are not statistically significant. The third hypothesis is not supported. And finally, attitude change was not positively correlated with understanding of the game. (Author/JLB)",

The child is challenged to develop an understanding of Canadian society which is pluralistic, economically and strategically exposed, divided regionally, and rapidly becoming urbanized. Contact experience with the inquiry approach should help the student to define soical issues, select and implement appropriate modes of inquiry, interpret data, and propose solutions. The basis for the curriculum  development is Dr. T. Aoki's Curriculum and Instructional Design Model. The development system is based on the cultural content consisting of disciplined knowledge, or John I. Goodlad's funded knowledge', and non-disciplined knowledge referring to value concepts adopted by a society as described by Goodlad's conventional wisdom. The authors have attempted to identify the major Canadian values and outline them in a conceptual framework. An Intended Learning Outcome matrix is also described.

The problem selected for their substantive research is the socio-political process in a growing city including the role and impact of: 1) civil service, elected officials, voters, and interest groups on the local government; and, 2) the relationship between the external political system and the citizen needs and wants in the core city. The many community resources and research reports to be used by the staff in the two parts of their research are enumerated here, and three questionnaries developed to survey student and citizen interest and knowledge of municipal government, and group influence on local government are also  included. The overall objective of this research is to design a simulation game. It would be composed of a basic package which would describe the demographic characteristics of an hypothetical city with several surrounding suburban development. Students would role play the part of individuals with identified residence, sex, age, occupation, home owning status, and net annual income. The second part of the game would consist of a series of problems and problem solving activities. The game would be followed by discussion and analysis of general concepts dealt with and/or student research in the community. A progress report is appended. (Author/SBE)",

Other major objectives are: 1) to enable the student to perceive the nature, development, and significance of political issues; 2) to develop problem solving skills in analyzing and comparing political issues; and, 3) to develop inquiry skills using case studies, and media. A preliminary questionnaire survey was conducted with Lethbridge and Coaldale, Alberta students: 1) to discover when and why student's social and political alienation occurs at various decision-making levels:  family, peer group, student council, city government, or provincial government; 2) to gain insight into the degrees students think they understand the decision-making processes at these levels; 3) to discover the students level of concern or interest, and the degree of influence they think they have regarding these structures; and 4) to look at the political and governmental knowledge. The results and interpretations are given concerning the overall positive attitudes yet demonstrated lack of knowledge of the functions of the political system. A framework and list of generalizations regarding the curriculum are given along with an outline of materials to be developed, and a selected bibliography. (Author/SBE)",

The primary goal is to encourage constructive involvement in urban life and community decision-making, and develop a personal and social competence that will engender a greater commitment to the city which is growing and changing. The concepts come from a variety of disciplines: 1) anthropology; 2) civil engineering: services and utilities; 3) ecology: the ecosystem and the utilization of resources; 4) economics: growth, role of the city, and business; 5) landscape architecture: site, ecology, aesthetics; 6) political science: decision-making, political history of the city; 7) psychology: the individual, communication, social  interaction and self concept; and, 8) regional planning: the interdependence of communities. Breifly, the intended learning outcomes include intellectual concepts, knowledge, and attitude change. The project staff has been working with students to develop and organize activities to cause such change or nourish positive attitudes in order to cope effectively within the community. Simulation games were tried, and work-studies in the community began. Intuitively, the students related their work to the social sciences.

The criteria for the selection of teaching strategies and activities are outlined: practice and development of intellectual skills, diversity of techniques, open classroom climate, active decision-making, use  of inquiry techniques, and free concept and value formation. Criteria for the structure of the materials are also given. To begin, the project reviewed relevant literature on: urbanization, child psychology and learning theory, structure and strategy in the social studies, printed teaching and learning resources, and current and projected social studies curricula for the Canadian provinces. The findings are summarized here and the bibliography is appended.

The interdisciplinary curriculum to be produced will be instrumental in assisting tenth and eleventh grade students in two or three months, to assess the changes which are occuring in selected Canadian Communities, and to gain some proficiency in predicting those changes. This report is primarily concerned with their study of urbanization which may be characterized by a continuum proceeding from an intact community to a megalopolis with urbanization as: socialization, change, migration, and as urbanism or a way of life. A sociocultural dynamics approach will guide the development and includes ideas from communication theory and sociocultural systems theory, and places the theoretical  emphasis upon a cybernetic-communications model; other approaches studied by the project are summarized in an appendix. As a result, three important concepts are: 1) systems: role taking and role making; 2) variation in behavior, human values, cultural contexts, and belief systems; and, 3) traditional behaviors. The major student behavioral changes anticipated are: 1) preference for a problem solving approach; and, 2) social insight, tolerance, participation, cooperation, and community attitude. Instructional materials will be multimedia and comparative and historical inquiry methods will be used. Student research tools and a bibliography of references and films are appended. (Author/SBE)",

During their work in 1970-71, they concluded that the best way to develop visual awareness was through the conceptual development of the visual components or the images and elements of design in terms of human values of urban areas. The modular units will be entitled: 1) Portals: points of access; 2) Skyline and Profile; 3) Focal Point and Landmarks; 4) Nodes: strategic points, gathering places; 5) Pathways: streets, rivers, railroads; 6) Edges and Entities: city segments; and, 7) Aura and Pulse: total sensual impressions. The elements of design are: scale, color, line, form, texture, and motion. The total program could range from five to ten months. The material should be  suitable for any learner above the sixth grade level in several existing subject areas: art education, social studies, sociology, geography, home economics, and environmental studies; to a lesser degree in: design studies, building arts, and history. The learning experiences of a unit will be entirely self-contained in a kit which will provide the basis for open inquiry on the topic. The open-ended student-directed investigation activities in his community should involve application of the unit to the school, the home, the neighborhood, and then the entire city. The expansion of the curriculum framework was influenced by a review of the works of urban designers included here. (Author/SBE)",

Little information is available about the first. Claims to validity for specific conceptions may differ between the researchers and the practitioners, and if research is to have an impact on practice, some disciplined study of the task and needs of the practitioner must be undertaken. In the field of knowledge production, researchers have asked a wide variety of  questions and applied various methods of study in education, sociology, and science. This research literature must stand the tests of critical review and organized synthesis to become valid knowledge in the general sense. The utilization of knowledge needs to be more fully understood if it is to be effective. Techniques for locating and retrieving information have been developed but have not been as successful as expected because they are not always related to the user's understanding and needs.

        "description":"The pilot study reported investigated changes in the educational values perceptions of student teachers, university supervisors, and cooperating teachers during the spring semester of 1971 at Lincoln East High School, Lincoln, Nebraska. Subjects included 76 student teachers, 69 cooperating teachers, and 32 university supervisors. The author-developed Educational Values Perception Inventory (EVPI) was administered to all participants as a pretest and posttest. The 56 items on the EVPI were divided into six major categories: philosophy of education, role of teachers, role of students, attitudes toward evaluation of students, teaching methodologies, and curriculum content. Each item was rated by participants on a five-point Likert scale. Scores were computed for both the total test  and for each of the six categories; t-tests and F-ratios were used to determine the level of significance. Comparison of pretest scores showed a significant difference between all groups; differences in posttest scores, however, were not significant. Although overall change scores from pretest to posttest were not significant for any group, the greatest amount of change was demonstrated by student teachers, who tended toward greater congruence with cooperating teachers and greater dissonance with university supervisors. All three groups were more liberal on the posttest. On the basis of data from this study, the EVPI has been revised and is being used in further studies. (RT)",

        "description":"The shortage of teachers has been discussed for years as a crucial problem. In 1969, the National Education Association estimated that the teacher shortage was 224,200 when a minimum quality criterion was considered. Despite this apparent shortage of &quot;qualified&quot; teachers, decreases in the number of births, and increases in the number of college graduate education majors reveal a trend towards a surplus of available teachers. Although presently the oversupply of teachers is in selected areas, such as secondary social studies and male physical education, projections indicate that surpluses will soon exist in all areas. Rates of increase for education graduates in New York State exceed those of the nation. Thus the problem of teacher suprlus is more acute in this state. Only 60  percent of State University College at Buffalo elementary education graduates were placed in teaching positions in 1970, as compared with 83 percent in 1966. In view of this problem, it is recommended that programs to prepare junior and community college teachers be expanded, that emphasis be shifted from preparing new teachers to improving the competencies of inservice teachers, that admission standards for teacher education programs be modified, and that student advisors at both the high school and college level become more familiar with trends in the demand for manpower.

The program began with a 4-day workshop for 60 teachers and aides, after which participants recieved 16 inservice training units, which included learning episodes, films of model teachers, and a videotape. After practicing with the materials and viewing the film, teachers videotaped themselves using the learning episode with a group of children and then mailed the tapes to the Laboratory for critiquing. Although subjective evaluation of the program by participants was very favorable, evaluation  accomplished through analysis of videotapes and assigning teachers to one of five levels of competence indicated that the program was a failure with 40 percent of the participants, moderately successful. Recommendations for changes included decreasing the number of units used, providing faster critiquing of videotapes, and granting college credit for the course.

In the first training method used, a videotaped model of the strategies was shown to the trainees, and its elements analyzed and discussed. The trainees attempted to reproduce the strategy in microteaching situations. In the second method, trainees were taught the process of creating or triggering teaching behaviors from the observational systems. They planned lessons where specific behavior could occur and tried out the plans in microteaching situations. Three groups of subjects were used: 1) a control group of 34 traditionally prepared student teachers; 2) a didactic group of 27 students; and 3) an eclectic group of 23 students. Tape recordings were used  to measure the variety of strategies and were analyzed according to Joyce's System for Analyzing the Oral Communications of Teachers. The mean score on variety of strategies exhibited by the control group. Training of teaching strategies. For student teachers in home economics, the didactic training method was equally as effective as the eclectic method in increasing the variety of strategies exhibited.

Criteria for evaluation were based on the specific objectives of the three groups of institutions selected: regional colleges, traditional colleges, and university departments of education. Random samples were selected from student teachers, secondary school teachers, faculty of teacher training institutions, and administrators of teacher education programs. The instruments used included four kinds of questionnaires, an observation checklist, and an interview schedule. The study was conducted in three phases: developing and validating criteria and instruments, administering the instruments  and collecting the data, and analyzing the data and reporting. The findings indicated that the Indian educational system is almost ready to move toward the development of a model secondary school teacher preparation program, but at present India exemplifies only the worst of educational settings, and Indian secondary schools and training colleges in general impart a mediocre education. The regional colleges, however, do provide a well balanced program, but meet with opposition from the other institutions. The report includes 25 recommendations for improving this situation.

The method involved an instructional learning package which enabled all the facets of self-motivation, self-direction, pacing, and self-evaluation to take place in an individualized manner in the classroom. The package could be validated through a specific task analysis on the part of the teacher. A strong foundation in the writing of behavioral objectives was the basis for the program and enabled participants to carry on an action program of implementation in their home district. The institute had five basic purposes: 1) to orient the participants in the use of behavioral  objectives and the construction of student learning packages by utilizing the existing training program developed in Willingboro, 2) to provide individualization on the part of the participants whereby they would progress through 12 segments of instructional learning packets, 3) to provide a broad span of varied learning experiences so that the students could practice self-direction and selectivity, 4) to offer definite suggestions for initiating an action program for the implementation of individualized instruction in the home district, and 5) to conduct a followup survey through the use of an extensive questionnaire.

The 52 subjects included 14 social studies majors, 14 language arts majors, 14 science majors, and 10 math majors, and they were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The subjects were observed in school situations by three observers using a modified Flanders instrument. The interaction analysis raw data were  recorded on IBM cards and mean percent scores and ratios for each group were obtained through a special computer program. A multiple t test program was used to compare the selected verbal variables of the groups. The findings indicated that student teachers who received a perceptual modeling concept presentation of interaction analysis during their preservice training showed significantly different verbal behavior in their classroom assignments as measured by a modified Flanders System of Interaction Analysis than those who did not.

Participants attended local colleges on a part-time basis and were also employed by the cooperating school districts as assistants or aides to teachers and other school personnel. Program attrition rates were low, the main reasons given for leaving being financial need, family or home problems, and personal change of goals.

Their work in school classrooms was increased until they were in complete charge of classroom management. A comprehensive evaluation of the program was not possible because adequate advance provision had not been made and there were no clearly stated measurable objectives. Evaluation was based on interviews and questionnaires, ratings by team leaders, and standardized test results for pupils.

Target dates provide that by 1972 techniques for improving educational management will be available to all school districts in Florida and by 1974 competencies expected of teaching personnel in elementary and secondary schools will be clearly identified. As a part of this overall program, a method of performance-based teacher certification is being developed based on the program approval approach. Institutions will be required to engage in a systematic procedure for determining  competencies and methods of assessment. At the same time, as state-sponsored research identifies teacher competencies related to pupil learning, these competencies will become a part of state program approval standards. For several years traditional teacher certification practices will be maintained parallel with certification through completion of an approved performance-based program. The same principles of the program approval approach used for preservice programs are to be used for state review and approval of school district inservice teacher education programs. (RT)",

The long range objective calls for participants to use techniques for assessment and training which will take into account individual differences in teachers, such as, interests, abilities, learning styles, and professional responsibilities. The individualization of teacher education is defined as maximizing the likelihood that the teacher will be motivated to acquire some new competency and that the necessary educational opportunities and resources will be available. The procedures described for implementing the module include pre-assessment, activities providing input, individualized input and practice with feedback, and evaluation. The document  includes an evaluation sheet, post assessment achievement test, key for evaluation, practice exercises, and component check list. (MBM)",

The strategy proposed has two major facets: to provide greater flexibility in the operation of local educational programs and to make local personnel accountable for results. A variety of teacher education programs will be used, and eventually teachers will be required to master only those competencies which have been demonstrated by research to relate to pupil learning. As a first stage, a catalog of teaching competencies will be compiled to serve as a reference for organizing teacher training materials, for analyzing teacher training programs, and for  identifying competencies for validation through research projects. Evaluation techniques will be identified or developed which correspond with the specific objectives included in the catalog. A series of research projects are designed to show the relationship between teaching competencies and pupil achievement. The third element in the program is the assembly of protocol materials and materials for training in specific teaching, planning, and supervisory skills; and the final element is the establishment of a statewide program for training teacher trainers.

Each of these elements is considered in some detail. The problem of clarifying goals and objectives involves three contexts: the content, the level of specificity, and the individuals or groups to whom it applies. Analysis and management includes the development of instruments to assess pupil achievement and to analyze productivity in any given situation in terms of the appropriate criteria for that situation. It also includes cost analyses which can be used in conjunction with the research and development projects and with analyses of the use of staff, facilities, pupils, methods, and time. The element of educational self-renewal  requires 1) continuous evaluation of the appropriateness of established objectives, 2) continuous monitoring of the extent to which a program is achieving its objectives, and 3) continuous identification of alternative policies and practices for consideration. These strategies should result in the generation of alternative educational practices and a greater freedom for the personnel of district offices and local schools to experiment with the newly developed techniques and materials.

Pupil control ideology is the attitudes of school personnel concerning their relations with pupils and the problems of pupil conduct conceptualized on a custodial-humanistic continuum. The subjects for this study were 87 teachers and 119 counselors; the instrument used contained four forms, one asking respondents for their own reactions to 20 items dealing with pupil conduct and the others asking them to estimate the responses of the typical teacher, counselor, and principal to the same items. All mean estimates of typical teacher ideology were significantly greater than the mean of teacher self scores. Pluralistic ignorance existed among teachers, counselors, and principals for the ideology associated with the role  of teacher. Teachers and counselors were inaccurate in the same custodial direction regarding the principal's role. The estimates of counselor ideology by teachers were not inaccurate, and those given by principals were close but generally inaccurate in a humanistic direction. It is believed that popular images of the roles contributed to the findings, with teachers and principals typically seen as conservative and concerned with managerial problems, while counselors are thought of as relatively pupil centered.

The coincidence between vocabulary taught in the instructional package and the vocabulary required to respond correctly to test items on the Gates-MacGinitie was determined to be much greater than could be attributed to chance, and the data showed that the teaching program needed be only moderately effective to improve substantially student gains in grade-equivalent scores in the test.

The sequence of visual development includes: general movement patterns of action, special movement patterns of action, eye movement patterns to reduce action, communication patterns to replace action, and visualization patterns to substitute for action. Visual memory for spelling can be enhanced by having a child practice the following steps: repeatedly trace over a word on a chalkboard, saying the name of each letter as traced. As the child learns to visualize, he learns to observe; and recognizing a misspelled word becomes a process of matching the word  visualized. (CK)",

The concept used in this paper is that a dialect is a part of a whole language. Some dialects are accepted as standard; others are considered nonstandard. Many teachers, however, will object that nonstandard dialect should be eliminated because it keeps its speakers from thinking logically. Each dialect of English contains subtle distinctions, and the question of language usage has no bearing on inherent language ability. There are four areas of language skill traditionally discussed by applied linguists: hearing, speaking, reading and writing. Objectives in terms of each of these four areas should be based upon individual  needs. The results of one experiment with black children demonstrate clearly the fact that children who do not speak standard English still may be able to understand it. Group references, moreover, play an important part in the use of language. An hypothesis still being tested is that learning to read is easier if the language of the reading materials matches the language of the learner as closely as possible. A similar situation may be true in the case of teaching writing skills. (CK)",

A survey form submitted to the certification officers of the 50 States and the District of Columbia provided the desired information. Accumulated data is intended to reveal the present status of certification requirements and educational preparation. Evaluation of the surveys submitted by the responding certification officers indicated a greater emphasis on United States citizenship and a slightly greater non-requirement of a loyalty oath. The title of the certificate issued to the neophyte art teacher is definitely dissimilar for almost every state certification department. Educational requirements are well established for general and professional  education. Analysis of the responses to the survey indicate a need to re-evaluate the specialization requirements for certification to teach art. There is a need for a modicum of certification agreement to facilitate reciprocal certification of art teachers among the several states. (Author/CK)",

Evidence supports the belief that in many testing applications the collateral information obtained from each subset of m-1 colleges will be useful for the estimation of the regression in the m-th college. Specifically, on cross-validation in a second sample, the Bayesian predictions had a smaller mean squared error in each of 22 colleges, the reduction averaging 9.7%, when compared with the least squares predictions when four predictor variables were used on a quarter sample in the 22 colleges where initial within-college sample sizes ranged from 26 to 184.  Furthermore, even when based on the full sample within each college, the least squares predictions had an average cross-validated mean squared error only barely less than the Bayesian predictions based on the quarter sample. The most apparent benefit of the Bayesian method is that it permits regression to be done in subpopulations where sample sizes are small and where the regressions are different in the subpopulations. In the present study, a decrease of more than 10% in mean squared error was obtained using this approach. (Author)",

The first study concerned the establishment of a profile of abilities of the retarded child as measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). The Vocabulary and Arithmetic subtests were found to be significantly low, while the Picture Completion, Object Assembly and Similarities subtests were significantly higher than the mean. A followup study was done to determine the causes for the extreme  scores found in the previous study. A tentative conclusion was that the brain injured child contributed more variability to the subtest scores than did the non-brain injured. More indications of brain injury and a lower correlation between intelligence and achievement was found for the hypothesized exogenous group. The final study (presently in the proposal stage) will attempt to show the differences which exist between the exogenous and the endogenous mental defective as measured by the WISC. (Author)",

        "description":"Among the four participating ethnic groups in Project Access for Los Angeles (Black, White, Mexican-American, and Oriental), the patterns of test performance that emerged were surprisingly similar to those from two previous studies of first-grade children, even though Access involved eleventh graders. Partially replicated was the finding that overall level of performance varied with social class, while the patterns remained rather constant within ethnic group, regardless of social class. This new evidence adds to the strength of the argument that our educational systems should be attending to, and utilizing, the variety of talents and aptitudes presented by the students, rather than attempting to treat everyone as a member of the majority group.

        "description":"Information from tests, when considered in the context of decision theory, can play an important role in vocational development. This role is primarily one of stimulating and facilitating exploratory behavior. Objective procedures for converting test data into counseling information are discussed and illustrated with special attention being given to similarity scores and similarity score profiles. The similarity score profiles, when used in conjunction with success estimates, avoid many of the pitfalls inherent in Parsonian approaches to test interpretation. A computer-based system incorporating the above data-information conversion procedures was developed and field tested with potential vocational school students. Longitudinal validation analyses involving more than 1,500  students and 20 interest and aptitude measures provided the empirical base for the data-information conversion procedures. Similarity scores and success estimates were developed for each of the 12 vocational program areas in which the students enrolled. These reporting procedures were then field tested with an additional group of 900 students enrolled in 12 high schools. Illustrations of the similarity score reporting procedures and student reactions to them are provided. (Author/CK)",

A common situation is when a battery of tests has been administered to samples of examinees from several populations. A very general model is presented, in which any parameter in the factor analysis models (factor loadings, factor variances, factor covariances, and unique variances) for the different groups may be assigned an arbitrary value or constrained to be equal to some other parameter. Given such a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method yielding a large sample chi-square of goodness of fit. By computing several solutions under different specifications one can test various hypotheses. The method is capable of dealing with any  degree of invariance, from the one extreme, where nothing is invariant, to the other extreme, where everything is invariant. Neither the number of tests nor the number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but to be at all interesting, it is assumed that there is a common core of tests in each battery that is the same or at least content-wise comparable.

Its components aimed at: increasing community participation of inner city parents in the educational process; recruiting black and Spanish-speaking teachers; improving the racial balance of urban and suburban schools; producing a &quot;working partnership&quot; with the business community both as a source of financial aid and as members of an &quot;adjunct faculty&quot; in the schools; and, developing new modes of instruction. Federal funding for Project Unique terminated in June, 1970. It has since been converted into a nonprofit corporation  chartered by the Board of Regents, under the auspices of the Rochester City School District. The creation of the corporation aimed to provide a vehicle for fund raising. It is held that there is little evidence to suggest large-scale financial support of public education by Rochester's private sector will be forthcoming. The Project has contributed to: (1) altering the racial composition of some city and suburban schools; (2) adding a significant number of black teachers to Rochester's teaching force, as well as three high-level black administrators; (3) effecting changes in the teacher training programs of many area colleges; (4) having some of the features of its model school component replicated in other public schools; and, (5) partially involving inner city parents in the educational  enterprise.

Programs were considered successful if they demonstrated cognitive benefits that were statistically and educationally significant. The second objective of this study was to determine the state-of-the-art in noncognitive benefit assessment based on a review of affective and social benefit evaluations of successful programs. After many evaluation reports were reviewed and site visits made, several programs were identified as successful and were then subject to closer analysis. The study concludes that very few compensatory education programs have clearly demonstrated success. Clearly, improvements must be  made in program evaluation before the effectiveness of such programs can be fairly assessed. Descriptions and analyses of some successful programs are included.

Over the years, the IDS program has evolved into a comprehensive five year enrichment curriculum, running from the kindergarten year through the third grade. The academic progress of both Institute and control children was monitored over the five year period by administering both standardized and Institute-developed tests and observational procedures. IDS experimental children and those in the control groups were tested with a wide battery of measures of ability and achievement. Longitudinal  evaluative information was obtained through the administration of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Form L-M), the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Tests, and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. The findings reviewed in this report show a positive change for children who experienced five years of enrichment in the Institute for Developmental Studies program, as compared with a control group of children who were not in the enrichment program. Experimental children performed better on a number of measures of ability and achievement, and appeared to maintain much of their early enrichment advantage over their controls. (Author)",

On the other hand, the importance of urban places in low income subregions is underscored by the finding that many of these places are growing. A more intensive examination of these places could determine what role they are playing in the urbanization process. The positive effect of subregional population change upon urban population change is the strongest consistent finding.

It was originally intended to collect appropriate baseline data prior to desegregation and then to observe subsequent changes in the data at various times after the desegregation had been implemented to obtain systematic feedback regarding desegregation effects. The collection, analysis, and interpretation of the baseline data collected during the spring of 1971 constituted Phase I of the overall study. The findings of only the Phase I study are reported here. This document is a report of research findings in classrooms  operating on the neighborhood school concept; it is not an evaluation of desegregation effects. In behavioral terms it is considered that there is no reason to believe that Kalamazoo teachers, as a group, discriminate against black students; teachers are just as accepting of ideas expressed by blacks as of those expressed by whites. Yet black students at both the elementary and secondary levels are held to have more unfavorable attitudes toward the school environment and seem to feel that teachers are less accepting of them than do whites.

Assessment of the relative level of interracial intimacy in the integrated projects is hindered by measures lacking in clarity and comprehensiveness, but the data actually reported suggest that both inter-and intraracial contacts were not particularly intimate. Although not designed to replicate or extend the findings of these studies, a study of four integrated, low-income public housing projects in Syracuse contained data which raise further doubts about interracial intimacy. The studies are interpreted in light of the voluntaristic nature of neighboring in urban society. (Author)",

The record of the past two decades shows that blacks have been migrating out of the rural South into the cities of the North and West. There, with greater choices, many have been progressing economically from unskilled low-paid jobs into white-collar and skilled occupations. In search of better housing and jobs, many have been moving out from their first place of urban settlement in city core centers into the surrounding suburban rings. Over a period of time, a migrant population has been giving way to a settled, urban, second generation, as increasing numbers are moving economically and socially from extreme poverty into middle-class status. Others are left behind, both in the rural back waters of the South and in the urban  centers.

The subjects (40 preschool children from low-income areas of New York City) were shown a quadrant Chinese letter array, and eye movement patterns were monitored by an Eye Movement Recorder. Subjects were then given training in a technique designed to encourage scanning through entire arrays. Following training, subjects were again recorded as to eye movement  patterns and retested on the Chinese Letter Naming Task. In terms of directly changing scanning behavior, evidence of the efficacy of the training procedure is absent. Whether or not training procedures similar to the one used here can produce changes in scanning remains to be seen.

Data from the census, the city Department of Planning and school sources, were used for the demographic descriptions. Information on real estate transfers was drawn from state corporation data, tax information, and deed recordings. One of these 16 census tracts was used as an illustrative case of the scope of the speculator activity and its effects. Speculator activity drove up the price of housing considerably:  to $1.5 million dollars mark up over nine years or a 58 percent mark up. Over a 20-year mortgage life, this amounts to a minimum of $7,200 overcharge for these properties as compared to one bought for fair market value. Hypotheses about the condition of the housing and the financial status of the black home buyer as explanations of the mark ups are rejected on the basis of comparative analysis. The effects of selling practices discussed on density, city services, schools, and family life are briefly discussed. (Author)",

There are clinical and social criteria by which students are labeled mentally retarded. The study concludes by noting that a pluralistic diagnostic procedure involves securing information beyond that are ordinarily considered in clincial evaluation. The findings suggest that only persons in the lowest 3 percent of the population should be labeled as subnormals, and that information about adaptive behavior should be  considered as well as intelligence test scores in making clincial assessments. Only persons who are subnormal both on the intelligence test and in adaptive behavior should be regarded as clinically retarded. (Author)",

The attitudes of both tutors and tutees were modified in a moderate but positive direction relative to control pupils. (Author)",

Participation in the Basic Occupational Language Training (BOLT) program was based on the assumptions that an intensive exposure basis will result in significant improvement in job-related and non-job-related English language capability as measured by designated tests and followup, and improvement in language capability will contribute significantly to persistence, success in and benefit from specific job upgrading programs, as derived from analysis of skill training reports and followup in employment. Other than the positive results that language improvement does, in fact, occur, and that it contributes to job retention and  upgrading, other inferences can be made from the data from computer analysis and a range of evaluation data compiled. The assumption that older men resist training is unwarranted as shown by significant increases in language competency in 40- and 50-year-old students. The report gives an account of techniques and actions which resulted in a continuation of the experimentation in a second phase now in progress. (Author)",

The 500 subjects were randomly assigned to two instructional groups and given a 30-item test requiring the subject to plot vectors from 12-lead electrocardiogram tracings. The results were analyzed using a computer program. There was no significant difference using textbook, programed textbook, lecture-workshop, and lecture-demonstration on achievement tests, but a significant difference among means of instructional time was  found. The second part of the study tested the hypothesis that among the groups of physicians there were no significant differences in the results of the test of knowledge requiring the application of the information taught by lecture with slides, set-clinic with slides, lecture with slides and a film of a patient, and bedside teaching with the patient that was films and slides. Volume II of the study is a programed text on spatial analysis of the electrocardiogram. (BC)",

In order to test the curriculum, two groups were selected, including a control group electing a comprehensive homemaking course and an experimental group electing a skill development course emphasizing a semester of each of  clothing and foods. The experimental group showed significant gains in attitude toward home economics and skill development, but there were no significant differences in study habits, general knowledge, development of critical thinking, or transfer of learning. The study implies that skill development should be emphasized in the beginning course of home economics while conceptual development should be emphasized in the high school courses. (Author/SB)",

The six work values under investigation were identifiable psychological needs: (1) dominance-recognition, (2) mastery-achievement, (3) economic, (4) independence, (5) social, and (6) interesting activity. The demographic variables chosen to be linked with the work values were marital state, age, educational attainment, employment status, career pattern, socioeconomic class, and field of work. Analysis of 1,871 returns revealed that the values which women seek from work are linked to specific demographic variables. The only value which consistently crossed all demographic variables and is, therefore,  considered the central work value for women was the mastery-achievement value. The two least important work values were dominance-recognition and economic. The results of this study have many implications for the guidance and counseling profession, such as: (1) the work values of men and women differ, (2) women need to derive a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from their work, and (3) women seek work to fulfill their social needs.

The study involved 205 automotive mechanics enrollees at four Pennsylvania area vocational-technical schools. The treatment group received individual, self-paced instruction on the simulator and performed significantly better than the non-treatment group which did not receive any simulator instruction. Affective, cognitive, and experience type variables were  predictive of troubleshooting efficiency, while cognitive and experience variables predicted success in troubleshooting proficiency. Instructors felt that the simulators motivated students, facilitated instruction, and enhanced learning. (Author/GEB)",

If a pattern of these changes can be established, or if a cause and effect relationship can be determined, the benefits to the community can be heightened. The purpose of this report is to delineate the characteristics of community power structures within a changing community in order to help community leaders expedite programs during those periods of social change. The report identifies the community power figures in Central City and determines the characteristics common to these people. Social problems and community needs are analyzed  comparing the views of the identified power figures and a sample of the community at large. There is also a consideration of the characteristics of community power structures that tend to inhibit or facilitate changes in occupational education and of implications for social action in relation to occupational education. The report concludes that a core of community power should be developed to attain the goals of occupational education, within the broader goals of the community. (Author)",

Preparation for occupational proficiency is conceptualized as a continuous process that begins with entry into the school system and continues throughout the individual's career. Curricular experiences are integrated continuously so that the relevance between school and work is readily visible. Thus, traditional dichotomies are obliterated, and the essential continuity of educational experiences is emphasized. The problem of integrating the individual's decision process into the curriculum is a basic step in attaining the national goals. (BH)",

Intended to provide occupational information to children in Grades K-9 at different levels of difficulty, each OCCUPAC contains multi-media materials in the form of slides, tapes, equipment, and materials used in different occupations, decision-making simulation activities, and other props. Some recommendations resulting from Phase I activities are: (1) Students seem to prefer using the OCCUPACS on an individual or small group basis, (2) Other occupational information activities such as field trips should be included into the OCCUPAC  program, (3) Teachers using the OCCUPACS need instruction concerning individualized instruction, career development, how to use information techniques with the packages, and counseling, interviewing, and listening techniques, (4) More OCCUPACS representing a variety of occupations should be developed, and (5) Effective preservice and inservice procedures need to be developed for orienting teachers and counselors to K-9 occupational information. Tape scripts for each of the 15 OCCUPACS are appended. (SB)",

To investigate certain demographic characteristics and opinions which influence county supervisors (gatekeepers) in the selection of publications for dissemination to vocational agriculture teachers, numerous publications were mailed to Maryland county supervisors. The extent of dissemination of these publications was checked through the vocational agriculture teachers, who also provided opinions regarding what types of publications they needed. Further, the supervisors were interviewed by telephone to obtain the demographic data and their opinions regarding several factors of the publications. Some conclusions reached as result of  the study were: (1) Supervisors were aware of teacher needs but did not disseminate publications to meet these needs, and (2) Supervisors base their opinions of publications in part on the general content of publications.

Findings indicate that at the fifth and sixth grade levels the program successfully acquainted students with a wide range of occupations. At the tenth grade level the cluster  skill training had a positive influence on the attitudes of the girls toward school, but there were no significant differences between the attitudes of the two groups of boys.

Conducted in response to critical problems in vocational teacher education, the institute focused on ways to locate and prepare adequate numbers of teachers to work with urban disadvantaged youth. The general plan of attack adopted by the institute was to have each participant, with the help of the 19 consultants, develop a teacher training model appropriate for his own situation. To this end, the format of the program consisted of a series of formal presentations, a question-and-answer panel, small group work sessions, and a variety of evaluations of the proceedings. A major  conclusion advanced by this institute was that the teacher education model needs to stress that the teacher is both a manager of resources and an effective specialist in a prescribed area.

A total of 60 participants, representing 23 states, Washington, D.C., and the Virgin Islands, took part in this program, which consisted of general sessions, homogeneous and heterogeneous small group sessions and a field trip to an inner city program. The general conclusion was that there is need for great flexibility and breadth in teacher requirements, certification, and preservice and inservice education. Recommendations include occupational experience for guidance personnel, guidance courses for vocational teachers, vocational courses for all teachers, flexible curriculums and methodologies in the areas of sociology and  psychology, and that colleges and universities should provide a vocational-technical teacher preparation program which extends beyond the confines of its classrooms.

        "description":"This analysis of entry into the labor force by American men between the ages of 30 and 39 was based on a set of about 1,600 retrospective life history interviews, approximately half from whites and half from blacks. At the time of entry the mean level of whites' education was higher than that of blacks and this was translated into jobs with higher prestige for the whites. When education was held constant there was little difference between the first job wages of whites and blacks. The only race differences at this early point were among men with very high levels of education, where whites had significantly better jobs. The social class of a respondent's family strongly influenced his level of education but did not affect the jobs he obtained. In the 8 years after entry, the gap  between whites and blacks spread to the lower levels of education. The tasks men performed were largely based on their levels of education, but their wages came increasingly to be dependent on experiential factors, so men with limited amounts of education could experience considerable wage mobility. The first jobs obtained after entry exerted a unique and continuing influence on later occupational mobility. (Author)",

        "description":"A total of 10 studies since 1962 pertaining directly to the use of cloze procedure as a teaching technique are initially reviewed. The reviewed literature is then synthesized to determine what is currently known about cloze as a teaching device and to identify general weaknesses in this research area. General problems identified are no real teaching, lack of focus, weak experimental designs, measurement problems, and omissions in reporting studies. It is concluded (1) that research evidence does not indicate the cloze procedure to be an effective teaching technique and (2) that past research in this area has been rather narrowly conceived and limited in scope. The author also feels that little attention has been focused on appropriate instructional strategies, methods of  presentation, and relative effects of varying deletion systems or benefits derived by different age or grade levels. Based on the problems identified, suggestions are made as to the direction future research might take, and guidelines for reporting cloze research are offered. This publication is one of the \"Reading Information Series: Where Do We Go?,\" designed to strengthen the research in reading education. A bibliography is included. (AW)",

Where there are financial difficulties, they are largely a result of internal decisions, both within the colleges themselves and in higher education as a whole as when objectives that cannot reasonably be fulfilled are established. The data for the study was collected during personal visits to each of the campuses over a period from July 1970 to March 1971. The interviews are part of the data and shape the interpretation of much of the hard data. This study is divided into two parts. Part I discusses, mainly, the collection of data. An overall financial analysis is made, and the impact of federal aid on the financial  status of colleges is studied. The benefits of efficient management and various college policies are also discussed. A bibliography is included. Part II is divided into four sections. Section I presents a number of statistical tables which summarize the major items of data collected and developed for the study. Section II provides statistical documentation of the major financial, instructional and federal aid characteristics used in the analysis of finance in Part I. Sections III and IV describe the stepwise regression and the analysis of variance used to examine the patterns of resource allocation at the 50 colleges studied. (Author/CK)",

An underlying assumption was that organizations select certain membership linkages in preference to others within a community. Thus one would expect to find points of integration and cleavage among community organizations. The data was collected in a community of 5,000 persons, and 41 organizations met the criteria of the researchers for inclusion in the study. Analysis of the data resulted in discriminating three percentage overlap clusters of organizations interrelated primarily because of their large size. Selectivity analysis of this data included eleven additional organizations not in the percentage overlap clusters. Four selectivity  clusters were delineated in this community; 16 organizations were not in any selectivity clusters and one organization, which had many selectivity linkages, did not cluster and was defined as a mediating organization. A selectivity Consistency Index was constructed which indicated a relatively homogeneous selectivity pattern of within and between selectivity clusters in the community. These findings suggest selectivity analysis as a useful technique in defining structural interrelationships among organizations. (Author)",

It is a continuation of research to determine the endurance of troops using combat equipment with 48-hour capability. Proficienty tests were constructed for each type of tank-crew activity and made part of a 12-hour field exercise. Two groups of crews were used; one group negotiated a problem course four consecutive times for a total of 48 hours of continuous operation, and a control group followed the same procedure but had 24-hour rest periods between each 12 hours of operation. Only moving surveillance and some driving activities showed significant performance deterioration over a 48-hour period of work  without sleep. Major conclusions were: (1) No serious performance decrements result from operating present tank equipment continuously for 48 hours without sleep; (2) Performance at night is not significantly affected by the subject's diurnal rhythm; (3) No major changes in present unit organization and tactical doctrine are necessary to accomplish continuous tank operations for periods up to 48 hours.

A pre-project survey determined the number of industrial workers to be about 20,000. Two questionnaires were used in the survey. One was addressed to the employer and was designed to obtain data about the total number of employees, the nature of industrial activity, the number of illiterate workers, and the location of the  company. The second questionnaire was directed at the illiterate worker and aimed, through an interviewer, to obtain personal information about the worker and to determine whether the literacy center should be located in the industrial establishment or near the residence of the worker.

        "description":"If human services in America are to become more responsive to the needs of the consumer, the training of the service worker will have to be radically transformed. Currently, the training of human service workers resembles that of prolonged apprenticeships. Teacher training, for example, requires general education and broad knowledge rather than specific skills that would make the service more productive. Changes in the character of human services require that these services be more consumer oriented, that they be offered in the style of the consumer, and the consumer have the opportunity to critically evaluate the service and, most important, that the consumer be directly involved as service giver. The training of human service workers must prepare the worker for consumer  participation. A training model is needed that is geared to the development of the specific skills required for effective service delivery. Participatory simulation can be applied to all kinds of training--that of teachers, social workers, doctors, and nurses. (CK)",

        "description":"A major concern of this article is to document the role of paraprofessionals in providing services for clients in the mental health and psychiatric fields. There are basically three types of paraprofessionals. The first type is the \"old\" hospital worker; he does not have a college degree, is not indigenous to the community in which he is working, comes from a low income background, is frequently Black or Puerto Rican, and does supportive therapeutic work. The second is typically a woman with a degree, generally engaged in substantive therapeutic work, and, mainly, white. The third is the indigenous paraprofessional who does hold a degree, is generally employed, and is engaged in therapeutically relevant work. A wide range of data on these professionals was collected. Although no  one of the studies conducted is conclusive by itself, a number of them such as the Ellsworth study are well controlled and offer powerful evidence. However, the multiplicity of evidence derived from a great variety of different sources, stemming from different investigator biases, using diverse methods and indices, leads to the conclusion that paraprofessionals play an important role as treatment agents and contribute to the improved mental health of clients and patients in highly significant, often unique ways.

        "description":"This study was undertaken to determine the homegrounds improvement situation among 4-H families in Polk County, Tennessee. It was conducted for the purposes of: (1) obtaining information concerning characteristics of homeowners and renters, (2) determining which recommended homegrounds improvement practices they were using, and (3) identifying some of the factors influencing them to adopt practices. Representatives of 84 4-H families (65 homeowners and 19 renters) were interviewed in random samples for comparison. Data were analyzed in numbers and percent, and adoption levels of homeowners and renters were compared on the basis of practice diffusion ratings. Findings disclosed that the average interviewee in this study in 1966 had the following characteristics: (1) was about 44  years of age, (2) had completed about nine years of schooling, (3) was a rural non-farm resident, (4) was a housewife, and (5) lived in a house built between 1950-59. Homeowner families were more often farm families, older, first occupants of their homes, lived in homes built between 1950-1959, and spent more money for plants than did renter families. With regard to the adoption of 27 recommended practices studied, homeowners were consistently farther along than were renters on nearly all practices. With regard to eight attitude toward landscaping statements and eight attitude toward nurseries statements, renters had better attitudes than did homeowners on most of the statements. More owners than renters reported larger inventories of trees and shrubs. (Author/CK)",

The educational counseling component of the program, Division of Adult Education, has as its major objective to maximize the opportunities of the WIN enrollee, who is encouraged to educationally advance himself vocationally and/or academically. Student questionnaires were distributed; a teacher survey was conducted; and statistical data on the classes were collected, in order to screen out the problems and concerns of this program. These were found to include the following: lack of student-teacher communication concerning vocational goals, lack of student motivation, varied abilities of students placed within the same classrooms, and personal and/or financial  problems of students. The conclusion drawn from all the data collected is that the success of the program depends largely on the placement of students into vocational and on-the-job training programs, getting closer to job placement and off the welfare rolls.

The home-based program is the SWRL Parent-Assisted Learning Program (PAL). PAL was created as an adjunct to a broader communication skills program, First Year Communication Skills Program (FYCSP), a criterion-referenced instructional program, which includes research-based instructional materials and procedures and is designed to teach kindergartners basic reading skills. In developing the PAL Parent Guide four basic guidelines were followed: (1) minimizing the reading requirements for parents, (2) providing a means for parents to practice skills being taught, (3) providing a means for parents to evaluate  their own learning, and (4) keeping training procedures as brief as possible. The current Parent Guide consists of 10 pages and includes the following: (1) a description of the purpose of the PAL Program, the materials included, and other basic information, (2) a description of the Practice Exercise and the General Instructional Procedures parents are to follow when using the Practice Exercises, (3) a series of exercises designed to give parents practice in using the General Instructional Procedures, (4) a pronunciation guide illustrating how the Program Words and Word Elements are sounded out and procedures for practicing the pronunciation of them.

As educational provision of the traditional type has expanded, so has the demand for education. One feature which most correspondence education systems have in common is that they cater mainly for adults. This survey attempts to assess the present situation in this field in the member States of the Council of Europe. It is based on information supplied by the member States. The significant elements only in the various national systems are presented. Statistics are not presented in standardized format. The report follows the particular characteristic of correspondence education, namely, its orientation toward its clients. The deductive approach is used. Chapter II identifies the  correspondence. Chapter III considers the institutions which exist to meet the needs expressed by the clients. Chapter IV deals with the educational methods employed by these institutions and traces the development of educational methodology in this field. Matters of external control and assessment are treated in Chapter V. In Chapter VI, some possible future developments are outlined. In particular, this last chapter deals with the growth of international bodies concerned to standardize practices and raise the level of professionalism in the correspondence field. (Author/CK)",

        "author":["Goldstein, Joel W."],
        "description":"The overall thrust of these 2 papers is that, with widespread drug use, we must re-examine motivation for drug usage and clearly distinguish between drug use and abuse. Considerable data is included on: (1) patterns of use; (2) relationships of use with peer attitudes and use; (3) the educational level of beginning use; and (4) attitudes and values related to use. The widespread use of drugs demands that the common practice of analyzing causation on the basis of personality differences between users and non-users be re-examined. Such analysis must take into account not only the user, but also which drug is used and cultural-environmental factors. The author, while acknowledging a continued role for personality variables in such analyses, clearly sees a trend toward explanatory  mechanisms drawn from the study of collective behavior. Disavowing the usual moral-based refusal to distinguish between illicit drug use and drug abuse, the author offers a value-free view of usage which is related to the problems of adolescence and of secondary education: the adolescent wants to feel better, believes that drugs will work, has no constraints against using them, and has the opportunity.

A generalized disposition is represented which ascribes reinforcement contingencies to either \"external\" (and, hence, uncontrollable) factors or to \"internal\" sources in which case the individual perceives himself as the effective determinant of reinforcing events. In this study, the \"control of reinforcement\" dimension was used to generate differential predictions about subjects' responsiveness to subtle social influence and experimenter effectiveness in producing change in verbal behavior. As predicted, \"external\" control Ss, selectively reinforced in a sentence construction task, evidenced significantly greater performance gains  then \"internal\" Ss. Other differences are also reported. All differences are interpreted as being due to the internal's resistiveness to subtle forms of influence. Consideration of the control of reinforcement dimension as an important determinant of responsiveness to social influence in certain situations is emphasized. (Author/TL)",

Seventy-two introductory psychology students were paired on a task which required that one of each pair become \"indebted\" to the other. Their roles were then reversed, and data was collected to see if the debtor-turned-creditor gave back more than he had received (reciprocal altruism). The theoretical bases, procedures, and variable manipulations are described in detail. A major finding of the study is the negative correlation between self-esteem and reciprocation. That is, persons with high self-esteem reciprocated less than those with lower self-esteem. Two possible interpretations are offered. It is also reported that, where subjects anticipated  face-to-face confrontation with the other member of their pair, they were more likely to reciprocate. Overall, a cynical interpretation of this finding is favored by the authors: in the absence of a threat to punishment, one doesn't repay his debts unless he must face his creditor. (TL)",

The house plan literature is exhaustively reviewed and is shown to effectively deal with the problems of Chicago's schools. The description of the model program is extensive and includes: (1) administrative organization; (2) relationships between goals, curriculum, student body, facilities and staff; (3) actual services, facilities and equipment needed for implementation; and (4) staff roles. The model is then compared  with: (1) the current services in Chicago's high schools; (2) selected national, state and local guidelines; and (3) the shortcomings of Chicago's pupil services as described in the 1964 Hauser and Havighurst reports.

More recent trends in behavior modification with children are then examined.

Racial and ethnic prejudices create the vicious cycle of low expectations -- low achievement -- lower expectations. Abilities are further undermined by the emphasis in schools on verbal skills and reading as opposed to non-verbal skills. Ability tests, standardized with middle class white children and geared to their value system, are used to classify all children for the rest of their lives; however, most minority group members cannot do well because of the test's irrelevance or senselessness. Because these children's backgrounds and experiences are so diverse, standardized tests provide little help in achieving the goal of equal educational  opportunity when used for grouping children. However, if they are used to develop recommendations for individualized instruction, to provide experiences appropriate to the development of each child, they have value.

The author examines comparative theories of student protest movements from other cultures, as well as discussing the varied theories which have attempted to explain the American student protest movement. Also included is a fairly comprehensive overview of the historical development of the student movement in our country. In a final section, the author discusses \"what is to be done?\" and points to  the complexity of developing social and educational policy. Several approaches are presented as possibilities for working with student protest and their possible impact is explored. (TL)",

        "description":"Reported relationships between individual characteristics and group performance have been weak, but Davis (1969) and Johnson (1970) found that a subject's stated preference for working alone or in a group was associated with differences in group performance. In the present study, preference for group or solo participation was examined in relation to personality measures that focus on interpersonal behavior. On the Fundamental Interpersonal Behavior Organization and Maudsley Personality Inventory Scales, individuals stating a preference for groups consistently scored in the direction of greater social responsiveness and extraversion than individuals preferring solo participation, and were more amenable to attempts by others to exercise control in social interaction. Ratings of  such subjects by their co-participants in group decision-making were highly intercorrelated, the most extravert subjects being most likeable. Furthermore, subjects preferring group to individual decisions were found to be more socially responsible. Choice of a work setting in an ambiguous situation may be associated with interpersonal stances that individuals consistently wish to adopt. (Author/KS)",

In addition, special emphasis is given to recent attempts to define and assess college student values and value change with comments on the efforts of Keniston, Wheelis, and Rokeach. Finally, the author presents a conceptual model of values and their relationships to the belief and attitude systems of Rokeach and show how this conceptual model is  related to the development of the College Student Value Questionnaire, an instrument for measuring contemporary college student values.

A second purpose was to apply models of analysis suggested by quantitative models of Concept Identification to the data from a traditional shift study with children, in order to provide some information regarding the processes which result in concept acquisition. Comparison of post-shift solution rates revealed that the effect of the detailed instructions was to decrease the difference between reversal (R) and  non-reversal (NR) shifts in the predicted direction, and R shifts were still solved more quickly than NR shifts. Further analyses revealed that the data could not be accounted for by no-memory hypothesis sampling models. It is suggested that current developmental theories which can account for the relative difficulty of R and NR shifts be elaborated to quantitative models of children's concept learning. (Author/TA)",

Background statistics are presented which indicate that women are increasingly entering the world of work, but are increasingly concentrated in the relatively less skilled, less rewarded, and less rewarding fields of work. Restrictive hiring practices and subtle forms of discrimination which still persist based on old myths about women's capacities, performances, their work life expectancy, and their absence rates are cited. Several ideas are recommended for counselors. Among these are: special careers' nights for girls and  their parents to broaden the perspectives of both on their work horizons; more and better occupational information designed to erode the stereotypes and encourage a wide range of occupational choice; stimulate early interest in developing individuality of girls; use of parent conferences to help parents understand changing roles and changing choices in the career decisions of girls; and use of co-educational group counseling sessions to explore attitudes and expectancies.

No significant differences are shown between the experimental and control groups for either blacks or whites. The second study, in which 43 pre-schoolers were divided into 3 subject groups, varied the level of aggressive content by showing a different cartoon to each group. It was assumed that the children exposed to the most aggression would emit the most aggressive responses in a subsequent free play period. Again, no significant  differences were found.

        "description":"College Entrance Examination Board Scholastic Aptitude Test decile scores for 1106 university freshmen compared (annually for 7 years) with student achievement, attrition, and graduation showed positive correlation for some academic majors and correlations only at the extremes for other majors. Two hundred, or 36% of all drop-outs, were apparently capable of succeeding in college, and, except for a relatively few outstanding students, achievement was found to represent, in effect, a pass-fail system. After 7 years 539 or 48.7% of the entering group were graduated, 555 or 50.2% were lost by attrition, and 12 or 1.1% were eligible to continue. A follow-up questionnaire showed that 59 or 5.3% of the entering group were graduated from other 4-year colleges and a projection technique  indicated that a total of 160 or 28.8% of all drop-outs may have been graduated elsewhere, making an estimated total of 699 or 63.1% of the original class who may have received a bachelor's degree in 7 years.

The authors hope that these 5 programs will serve to show how certain urban, suburban, and rural communities have responded to the guidance needs of their children. The general model presented grew out of a careful consideration of the common threads running through these programs and from the recommendations of the advisory committee as to what might constitute a model program. The focus of this model is on the importance of  early identification and prevention of learning problems of all children.

A week-long training program patterned after Carkhuff (1969b) included the conditions of empathy, regard, and genuineness; training in the action aspects of counseling; and experienced-based learning in interpersonal relations and communication skills. Carkhuff's Index of Discrimination was administered to the experimental group both before and immediately after their training experience. Each experimental subject nominated a control subject similar to him in age, education, vocation, interests, etc. There was also a 3rd  random control group. The 3 groups were roughly equivalent before training, with the experimental group tending to do somewhat higher in level of discrimination ability. This group improved considerably after the training program, while both the matched control group and the random control group declined slightly. Thus, the study shows that at least on the discrimination variable, lay helpers can be quickly and effectively trained. (MA)",

This study was planned to examine the proposition that the effects of interracial association on tolerance and acceptance of other group members depends upon the circumstances under which the association occurs. Carried out in an elementary school that had experienced massive integration in the middle of the school year, the study was run in 2 parts: the first concerned sociometric choices of pupils and the second concerned interactions of black and white pupils in the classroom. Both sociometric and interaction data revealed a strong tendency for members of each group to prefer to associate with other  members of their own race. Furthermore, this tendency was not improved by a year of association in a school situation that appeared to have ideal conditions for fostering interracial acceptance. Yet, although equal status association may not eliminate the cleavage between races, it may eliminate much of the hostility that has been fostered by unequal status non-association. (Author/TA)",

Two characteristics, interpersonal trust and a need for ethical consistency, were translated into empirical questions and studied accordingly. Subjects were undergraduate college students who scored low or high on the New Left Scale and the Political Activities Scale. Results of the experiment indicate that (1) activists demonstrate greater interpersonal trust than do conservatives, and even when that trust is diminished by interaction, activists appear more willing to acknowledge their opponents' strengths; (2) activist students more readily admit ethical transgressions, when confronted, than do more conservative students; and (3) components of primarily  political attitudes can be related in predictable ways to behavior in situations that are not explicitly political in nature.

It also examines the effects of students' ability, using a general measure (determined by school tracking procedures) and a specific measure (achievement test in the specific class). The results of the study indicate that, after playing the basic version of T/D twice, further playing of the basic game or the advanced game will not increase students' understanding of the mechanics of the game (perceptions), strategies of play, or analogies between the game model and the real situation. The effects of students' general ability on learning in the game were weaker for learning of strategies than for learning of perceptions of the game, or for understanding of the analogies  between the game and real life. The learning of perceptions and of strategies was not related to the specific measure of achievement, but the correlation between learning of analogies and the achievement measure was significant.

Cost models were developed for both. Research findings include: (1) OIAS rated \"good\" and the Counseling Center \"fair\" when compared with a model system checklist; (2) both systems were attractive, OIAS largely because of its unique teletype terminal and the Counseling Center because of students' information needs; (3) counselors had more effect on students' career plans and career certainty than did OIAS, though this difference was due in part to dissimilar system purposes, different student motivations for using the two systems, and  the large number of OIAS users who were certain of their future careers before accessing information; (4) all but a few students were satisfied with the information received from either system; and (5) OIAS delivered information of at least equal quality to the Counseling Center in about one-half the time per user, at a cost one-tenth or less that of the Counseling Center. The main conclusion is that OIAS is a useful tool for counselors and students because of its general ability to store and deliver information more efficiently and less expensively than counselors.

Firstly, since the educational setting is challenging and often fear-provoking for disadvantaged students, it would seem desirable to reduce the generalized expectancy of powerlessness that is characteristic of many of these children. A way to reduce some of the disastrous effects that the American school has often had on the disadvantaged child is to increase his perception of his personal responsibility in the outcomes of his education. Secondly, educational administrators would do well to strive to employ as many well-qualified black teachers as possible in order that black students could have a choice of teachers in terms of race. A third  implication of the concept of internal-external control for education concerns the social rejection and isolation of black students by white students and teachers in desegregated schools. Rejection and isolation is largely seen by the black student as out of his control. (Author/JM)",

In each school the principal and a small group of key personnel identified by the faculty and selected by the principal should be trained to use problem-identification and problem-resolution techniques. The training is to be directed specifically to the  needs of the school system. The training should be accomplished through short two- and three-day workshops followed up by periodic single-day sessions. The building of the cadre in each school should take place over an extended period, but it can begin to be a problem solving or reducing mechanism after initial training.

Eighty-five percent of the teachers granted that a deficiency in knowledge, understanding, and the know-how of communication among the cultures of Mexican Americans, Indians, and Anglo Americans could be the reason for failure to meet the needs of the students. Among the objectives of the program were: to conduct training for the professional staff, the student population, the community, and non-certified personnel with regard to human values by means of in-service programs geared to the specific needs of each respective  group; to conduct highly concentrated beginning-of-the-year orientation in-service sessions according to the individual needs of the staff; and, to prepare long-range sequential procedures, which will lead to a balanced curriculum and provide for relevancy in the instructional program, so that students will get more meaning by being able to relate their home environment to their school environment, at least partially.

A politicization of ethnicity is being played out in New York City schools. While Puerto Ricans are legal citizens of the United States, free to enter and leave New York City at will, the legal status of the &quot;others&quot; is precarious; many have illegally by-passed U.S. immigration laws. Their presence has important consequences not only for them but also for the nature of the interaction between the entire &quot;other Hispano&quot; segment and the American society. Even when political units acknowledge that Puerto Ricans are but one segment of the Hispano group, they are of necessity  forced to recognize the Puerto Ricans as the political spokesmen for the larger Hispano segment. The Hispano often fails to make a permanent commitment to immigrate to the United States, thus further modifying the patterns of assimilation and acculturation taking place.

The extensive evaluation disclosed various strengths and weaknesses of all components. The major changes suggested were: (1) separate levels of instruction for children at or near grade level and those well below grade level; (2) improved  communication in the CRMD Component; (3) more consistent selection of qualified teachers in the ESL Component; and, (4) year round commitment of staff, and early commitment of funds for significant improvement in the success level of the summer program.

The overall concept guiding the study was that paraprofessionals are certain kinds of people who perform certain tasks and have an impact on certain people around them. Out of this concept came the three tasks set for the study: to develop a profile of paraprofessionals giving background characteristics related to the purposes of the  program and to the impacts paraprofessionals are intended to have; to survey the nature of paraprofessional work, determining what specific activities they carry out, in what kinds of schools, in what physical locations, and on what time schedule; and, to determine the impact paraprofessionals have on the paraprofessional himself, pupils, teachers, the school principal, and parents.

The New Careers Program seeks to create a category of jobs in the human service field which will provide a &quot;career&quot; ladder through which individuals of low income and minimal education can progress from an entry level position up to a professional rank if educational requirements are met. Exercises centering on the creative arts can be designed to modify the self concept and self esteem of students. The quality  of the environment provides the raw materials upon which children can project themselves: art, poetry, dramatics, and choice of books. Genuine liking and respect for children is considered shown by offering such opportunities for the development of individuality. (Author/JM)",

Four centers in Chicago supplied sites for training and research. Program emphasis was on one to one tutoring at least once a week for predominantly black and poor primary school children no more than one and one-half years below grade level academically; academic groups were combined with leisure, some auxiliary services, and cultural activities. The research design compared academic achievement in reading before and after tutoring, as measured by the Gates Reading Tests. Participants and control groups were tested. Reactions of tutors and coordinators were gathered, as well as a community study to gather factors affecting  organizational stability of centers. Among the findings, one of the major handicaps in the development of volunteer work was the lack of ability on the part of professionals to relate effectively to non-professionals and to help them develop effective skills.

Metapolicy deals with policies on policymaking, including the characteristics of the policymaking system and basic policy frameworks and postures. Unless urban metapolicy is improved, no meaningful improvements are possible in concrete policies on specific issues. Required changes in urban metapolicy include: (1) development of urban policy sciences knowledge; (2) invention of new urban policy tools; (3) explicit strategy determination; (4) new policy-contributing institutions and/or policy research organizations; (5) improvement of urban policymaking personnel; and, (6) advancement of citizen participation. This analysis  has important implications for urban educators. On one hand, similar improvements in the urban education policymaking subsystems are needed for better urban educational policies. On the other hand, some radical changes in urban education are needed to meet the needs of better urban metapolicies. These include: (1) education of adults for more active roles in urban policymaking; (2) preparation of children for even more active future roles in urban policymaking; (3) training and retraining of urban policy practitioners for new patterns of urban policymaking; (4) training of new types of urban policy professionals; and (5) development of policy scientists.

Kansas City mental health professionals and educators sought to prove the hypothesis that negativism might be reduced if the teachers had an improved awareness of themselves and the inner city community and children. The research design included participating and non-participating teacher groups, a principal's group, and a supervisory personnel group. A semantic differential type of instrument was used for pre- and post-testing.

        "description":"The &quot;assimilation perspective&quot; on minority group relations in America distort empirical reality because of two hidden assumptions. First, divergence or difference is recognized at an earlier point--only to be corrected by equalization of opportunity. The second tends to view the &quot;new world&quot;--the assimilated--as homogeneous. The cumulative effect of the Civil War was to lead to a legal perception of the black man as a person, while the social perception of him as property persisted with behavior tending toward the latter. The second world, however, would have emerged apart from this discrepancy--in part because black men came to the U.S. in chains. Every black family must teach its young and help them to develop a strategy to cope with being black in America. It is clear now that  strategies of culture deprivation--compensatory education, Head Start, Upward Bound, etc.--are doomed to fail. The failure comes as a result of the belief that the attitudes, feelings, and behaviors of blacks are pathological deviations from a superior white life style. The emergence of a &quot;black life style&quot; is, however, a result of social reality. Deviance and deprivation are misleading constructs, implying that blacks can be something they cannot be, namely white.

This drop of 12 percent from the 2.9 million in 1968 reflects further utilization of farm labor-saving technology. Members of the 1969 HFWF were mostly young (median age 23), white (77 percent), male (74 percent), persons living in non-farm places (74 percent). They earned an average of $837 in cash wages, or $10.75 a day for 78 days of farm wage work. Only 21 percent were engaged chiefly in farm wagework. Of these, 301,000 were year-round workers, who were the most fully employed and highest paid, averaging 319 days of farm wagework and earning $3,485. About 60 percent including housewives and students were not in the  labor force most of the year. About 257,000 were domestic migratory workers. This group declined at about the same rate as all hired farmworkers, thus continuing to comprise about 10 percent of the total.

Specifically, it compared reliability estimates determined by averaging across individually obtained job ratings and reliability estimates based on consensus ratings from interacting panels. To investigate reliability of job ratings obtained from individuals and from panels of raters, 450 basic airmen rated 100 brief job descriptions individually and in panels of three and five raters. Analysis revealed that estimates of mean reliability were greater for individual raters, and mean rating time increased with panel size. Consequently, the individual approach appears to be more economical and efficient than the  panel procedure, in terms of reliability, time required, and number of raters required. (Author/BH)",

Five test batteries were administered to groups of approximately 1,900 subjects each. Multiple regression analyses indicated that there were significant interaction effects for six of the selected tests. The relationships between the cultural variables combined and each aptitude test were significant for all tests. Significant net relationships of race, educational level, and geographic area were found with a majority of tests, although wide differences were found among aptitude tests in their sensitivity to demographic-cultural influences. Race appeared to be related to  tests in most factor areas, with its highest relationship in the mechanical area, whereas education, which had the lowest relationships with the mechanical area, had the highest relationships with verbal, numerical, and reasoning factors. No discernible trend was noted for geographic area. (Author/BH)",

Labor costs and shortages most directly affected farms that sold $20,000 or more of farm products in 1964 and 1966. In 1966, these farms produced 68 percent of all farm products sold and used 68 percent of all man-hours of hired labor. Yet the farm family was the major source of manpower in both years. Regular hired labor was important on farms with $40,000 or more in sales and a major source of hired manpower for dairy and livestock operations. Workweeks were shortest for tobacco farmers, longest for dairy farmers and livestock ranchers. To  produce $100 of sales, more labor was used on small farms, particularly tobacco farms, than on large farms in both 1964 and 1966. Data in this report were derived from information obtained in two Pesticide and General Farm Surveys conducted by USDA's Economic Research Service on 1964 and 1966 farm operations. This report presents data for farms having sales of $5,000 or more. (Author)",

The data indicate that reaching maximum staffing levels by 1977 is unlikely, although minimum levels probably can be achieved. The study highlights the need for expanded refresher training for high school skill level jobs and both post-recruitment and refresher training for college skill level jobs. The report recommends the development of a plan for state action in safety manpower, with guidance and funding by the National Highway Safety Bureau.

        "description":"Two methods are presented for extending Holland's occupational classification to include all occupations in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT). Holland's classification is based on a theory of personality types, with occupations in the classification organized into major categories (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional) and subcategories using the same concepts. The two conversion methods enable translation from any DOT occupational code (a six digit number) into the corresponding Holland Occupational code. The first method is essentially an application of Bayesian statistics to 399 occupations in Holland's Occupational Classification, while the second method was developed by using the definitions of each DOT group (first three DOT  digits) and assigning the Holland code which seems theoretically consistent with the DOT definition. Testing and comparisons with four occupational samples revealed that Holland's classification could be extended to all DOT occupations. (Author)",

The model is designed to examine the flow of men, throughout their lives, through the occupational structure. Using retrospective life history data collected from a sample of black and white men, the model treats men at age 13 as inputs into different statuses in education and the labor force, including the military, and examines changes through age 39. In addition, hypothetical experiments are carried out via the model to find the occupational distribution of blacks if their particular educational and occupational experiences are modified to correspond to those of whites. The results of these experiments suggest the general utility of  the model both for policy formulation and the scientific study of occupational changes. (Author)",

        "description":"For a large portion of its student body, the school makes no conscious effort to prepare for the transition from school to employment. Instead, the school concentrates on preparing students for more school. About 20 percent of high school students receive some form of vocational education, but under pressure from the Congress, schools are beginning to recognize that they should meet the needs of a higher proportion of their students. Vocational education is devoting more attention now than formerly to the needs of the student and is placing less emphasis on meeting the narrow needs of the labor market. Although vocational education is criticized for being too narrow and specialized, this is rarely true. However, the principal method of evaluation of vocational education  (immediate job placement) places a premium on specialization. The major weakness of vocational education content lies in its exclusion of many important occupations. There are several types of obsolescence of vocational education, some of which are much more serious than others. The part-time cooperative method of instruction, broadened teacher education, in-school employment offices, and better instructional materials are means of minimizing obsolescence. (Author)",

The report points out that several effective approaches could be implemented at substantially less cost than conventional classroom kindergartens and preschools. The major goals of statewide programs for children under 6 years of age should be to: (a) strengthen the family role and involve parents in the education of their children; (b) provide for the health, safety, and psychological needs of young children; and (c) provide remedial health and education programs for all preschool children in need of special services. An analysis of federal priorities and programs indicates that states will  be required to carry the major burden of early childhood programs and coordinate them with the many ongoing federal programs. Topics discussed are: state organizational structure; alternative approaches; objectives; training and certifying personnel; physical facilities; methods of providing state financial support; and implementation. Appendixes present a discussion of educational goals; a summary of pending federal legislation; and information on state funding and personnel programs in early childhood development.

Major findings reported are: (1) in most urbanized areas, there is a crisis in educational finance, yet school districts in rural areas received more federal aid per pupil;  (2) there was no compensatory relationship between federal aid and assessed property valuation; (3) because of the impact of Title I, districts with lower income and higher proportions of nonwhite pupils received more aid than those with lower proportions; (4) amounts of aid received varied markedly and erratically in individual school districts; (5) the failure to concentrate funds on most needy students has resulted in fragmented programs or new equipment; and (6) amounts of aid are too small in view of the existing problems.

        "description":"Training is one of the many means that an organization may use to help its employees in their adaption to organizational change. F. Olsen Ltd. is a major Norwegian International Shipping organization. This study was concerned with the Olsen Berths based at Mill Docks in the Port of London. The major problems, as defined by senior management at that time, were as follows: (1) the supervisors were not prepared to work in different ways to suit the new methods of work; (2) the supervisors would not accept that they were an integral part of management; and (3) the intergroup rivalry between the supervisors at the two berths was having a bad effect on work output. The first task for the trainer and researcher was to produce some sort of quantifiable factual evidence of the present  activities of the supervisory team. Management meetings were held to identify and solve the problems. The intention from the start of this project had been to develop a management team at Olsens that would be self-regulating and responsible for its own self-development. The evidence from the study suggests that this objective was at least partly achieved. The Olsen study offers some insights into the possible requirements of an effective change program. All those involved in change must be consulted about the reasons for change and its possible effects. (CK)",

        "description":"With the acceptance of the concept of life-long integrated education, education is seen as a global system which not only prepares people for life, but which is an integral part of life itself. Before the introduction of Western systems of education, Asian education was related to one's position in society. However, Asian countries now show their belief that education is one of the most important keys to development by devoting high proportions of national budgets to it. The current difficulties of formal education include: (1) education-employment antinomy, (2) education-manpower inbalance, (3) education and its anti-rural bias, (4) the closed system of education, and (5) the cost of education. To solve these problems, entire school systems will have to change. This process can  be accelerated by fuller university involvement in adult education. Asian universities have a solid base to build a program of continuing education. Thousands of adult students are being served by extension courses. Up to now, the role of the universities has remained limited in the field of continuing education. This condition results from unchanging attitudes from within and lack of financial support from without. There is, in addition, a need for smooth working machinery; organizational patterns must be worked out on a country by country basis. UNESCO will extend aid to those governments engaged in adult education programs. (CK)",

        "description":"This paper describes Personality and Educational Environment Scales (PEES) and a self-concept theoretical model, used in diagnosing dropout from educational institutions, as utilized in a follow-up study of participation and dropout in adult education classes. A dropout was defined as a person who after being present for session 1 or 2 was absent for the midpoint session and four successive sessions of a continuing course. The PEES form, measuring the student's rating of himself, his lecturer, the other students, and his ideal self, as well as his reasons for giving up the course, was sent to persister and dropout participants of adult education evening courses. A total of 948 PEES were received from persisters and 326 from dropouts. A factor analysis was performed on the data  obtained from the PEES, and mean scale ratings were obtained; a matrix of over 13,000 mean scale and discrepancy ratings were produced. The findings of the study show that low discrepancies (or assumed self/other similarities) are associated with persistent behavior, whereas dissimilarity (or high discrepancy) is associated with dropout.

The purposes of this data-collection technique were: (1) to identify some of the characteristics of low-income families; (2) to determine some of the homemaking practices and needs of low-income homemakers; (3) to discover what low-income homemakers consider as problems related to food and clothing; and (4) to suggest ways to respond to these problems. The data collected were analyzed by frequency distribution. Results of the study show that the primary concern of these homemakers is getting enough food for the money they  have to expend; the same concern showed in clothing problems. A need for help with financial planning is clearly evident. Impressions of the families, as shown by interviewers' notes, are presented; these \"word portraits\" relate to family characteristics, health, income and money management, and housing and housekeeping. The resolution of these problems will require the efforts of other agencies, as well as Cooperative Extension. (CK)",

The purpose of this discussion is to explain the assessment procedures that publishers should use in order to assure the publication of only high quality programs and to share this information with educators. When he first receives a program, a publisher should have it checked over by an expert, and a decision should be rendered as to whether or not it is academically sound and whether it is appropriate for a specific educational curriculum. The program is then objectively tested in a classroom situation. Once appropriate sample subjects are selected, the students are administered an objective achievement test as a pre-test. Next, they work through  their programs. Attempts are made to minimize the effects on the students' learning of all variables other than the program itself. Upon completion of the program, the students take the achievement test again as a post-test. Finally, the students and teachers complete standard program evaluation forms. The data gathered from the pre- and post-tests, from the students' actual work on the program, and from the evaluation forms are then analyzed. A final publish-no publish decision is made according to the criterion of the amount a student learns from the use of the program. (CK)",

Inherent within this examination was the evaluation of the effectiveness of the training period toward producing desirable and/or favorable changes in participants' knowledge and understanding of A.B.E. and attitudes toward the A.B.E. program. The following were selected as the independent variables for this research: age, sex, race, educational achievement, A.B.E. experience, and place of residence. Data was collected on these variables. The topics basic to the overall theoretical perspective employed here are presented in the  following order: reference groups, attitudes, values, characteristics, review of related research, and hypotheses. The major statistical techniques employed in the analysis of data included analysis of variance, McNemar's test for significant changes, correlation, and chi-square. Although it was concluded that the subjects' attitudes became more favorable toward the A.B.E. program during their participation in training, the extent to which the content of the training influenced the change rather than outside factors was not determinable from available evidence.

Addresses presented were: \"Aging--The Need for a Choice\" by Dr. Thomas Rich; \"The Physiology of Aging\" by Dr. Fred B. Thigpen; \"Psychology in Aging\" by Dr. Neil Coppinger; \"Second Career Planning for Older Adults\" by Dr. Irving L. Webber; \"Counseling Older Adults and Using Community Resources\" by Mrs. Margaret E. Miller; \"Learning and the Older Adult\" by Dr. George F. Aker; and \"Financial Support and Provision of Facilities\" by a panel composed of Harold Kastner, James Fling, Myrtle Burnett, and Chalmers Murray. Three resource documents are included in the  proceedings: \"Some Issues Concerning Education for the Aging\"; \"Suggested Educational Activities for Older Citizens\"; and \"Survey of Community--Senior Citizen Information and Needs.\" A sample of a form used by the attendees to evaluate the institute and a summary of these evaluations are given. Among attendee suggestions are: that the next institute be held near a dynamic program; that people from out-of-state be invited; that presentations include nutrition and theological implications of aging; and that nursing-home administrators be invited to attend.

Home bound instructors were divided into six teaching teams, each comprised of a certified teacher who served as team leader and designed the materials used, two teacher's aides who recruited students and prepared and taught the materials, and five volunteers who conducted classes in private homes one night each week with the teacher as support. Daily two-hour inservice training was given to both aides and volunteers by team teachers and consultants. The 22 staff members hired attended a 30-hour workshop for both staff and volunteers which emphasized the psychology and teaching of adults and the types and use of instructional  materials. Homebound classes began on October 5, 1970 with 81 students and ended on June 30, 1971 with 342 students. The project was structured into three phases. Phase I was the enrollment and individual home instruction of students in organized &quot;kitchen classes.&quot; Phase II involved the grouping of students into classes at neighborhood centers. Phase III involved the initiation of an eventual take-over by volunteers. The project proved to be an effective vehicle for adult basic education home instruction. (Author/DB)",

Findings of the study are: (1) personal contact is the key to the success of the program; (2) contacting influential persons is necessary; (3) homemakers  have the best attitude toward the program, and are the most help in securing teacher-leaders; and (4) homemakers and students appear to be the best possibilities for serving as teacher-leaders, but more time should be devoted to training them.

The Experimental World Literacy Programme educational activities show two major methodological trends: an \"ecological\" trend and an \"industrial\" trend. The purpose of functional literacy is to develop in a socioeconomic context not only the technical and vocational skills of individuals but also their mental powers of analysis and their ability to communicate. A course that allows for diversification in respect to (1) programs and methods, (2) teaching materials, and (3) teacher recruitment is needed. The aim of a study of the environment is to ensure that the programs and their content shall  be well suited to its needs and problems. The teaching strategy involves devising teaching programs, preparing teaching materials, and training the teachers. An indispensable methodological prerequisite is that responsibility for functional literacy programs be assumed at the beginning by the socioeconomic authorities and institutions (technical ministries, industrial and agricultural undertakings, trade unions, etc.) of the environment concerned.

Case studies are presented of five of the colleges. The study group found that considerable community involvement is taking place on the part of the colleges, but some colleges are more concerned with community needs than are others; and there is considerable variation in the ways in which concern is translated into actual involvement. Recommendations include: (1) the uniqueness of each college be  preserved; (2) that colleges be encouraged to develop or to continue direct interest and involvement in the community; (3) that the practice of subsidizing only credit courses be reviewed; (4) more concern be given to the needs of the citizens in dealing with problems of their communities; (5) more attention be given to the learning needs of special groups, such as older people; (6) the placing of field men in different locations within an area to become better acquainted with the local people be encouraged; and (7) liaison with community organizations be continued.

Demographic and sociometric data was collected, as well as a measurement of the respondents' knowledge about the campus, and a ranking of each organization's stated priority for serving society, education, and campus community, or itself. Results show that organized group behavior is affected by intergroup interactions under certain conditions, namely length of members' time on campus, knowledge of the campus, the range of a group's contacts with other groups, the group's inception date, and the academic major of group members. The direction of extreme  organized group behavior, either conventional or aggressive, is determined by the degree of generational conflict and by family background and structure.

Students were free to explore typical role behaviors of the institution psychologists, their relations with other professional and para-professional workers, the treatment programs of the hospital, and its organizational structure. One goal was to induce changes in behavior relevant to the student's perception of state hospitals, both as social institutions and as occupational settings.

This paper focuses on some of the initial determinants of this own-group preference and on the isolation of factors which increase or decrease it. The major finding appears to be that the mere anticipation of cooperation or competition can affect \"own group bias\" (OGB). The finding that those subjects in groups anticipating cooperation also showed a significant OGB effect offers further support for the balance theory interpretation that classification as a member of one group along with exclusion from another is sufficient to produce OGB. However, this study does not lend insight into Rabbie and Horwitz's (1969) failure to find OGB as a function of classification  along, and their explanation that it may be due to the failure to provide justification for the division into groups remains plausible.

The author draws several conclusions: (1) different behaviors, labeled as mental illness, must be treated in different ways; (2) the term \"illness\" is more appropriate to some cases of mental illness than to others; (3) each of the seven meanings entail deviation from some norm or standard; and (4) those involved in the  institutionalization of individuals on the grounds of mental illness are obligated to spell out what norms or standards form the basis for their judgment.

Current biases and prejudices concerning drugs and users are viewed as obstacles to solutions. The most commonly used educational and preventive measures are critically evaluated. Attitude change is considered a more important goal than mere factual presentations. The counselor's role vis-a-vis school drug users is examined. The school board's attitude is seen as crucial in determining whether schools will help or not. Several new approaches are recommended: (1) growing community involvement in helping schools educate against drug use; (2) the viewing of the problem as a holistic one; and (3) the approbation of school boards as a stimulus to teacher and  administrator involvement.

Internals are defined as persons who believe that reinforcement is contingent on their behavior, while externals are those who believe that reinforcement is independent of their actions and is controlled by chance or powerful others. Attraction was assessed after subjects were differentially successful in changing the opinions of two confederates. Results on a behavioral measure support the hypothesis that internals are more attracted to others they are able to influence, whereas externals do not differentiate their attraction on the basis of others' persuasibility. However, on an attitudinal measure, there was a trend for  internals to be more attracted to the confederate with whom they were less successful. A possible resolution of these results is discussed.

Job-seeking behavior is viewed as contingent upon two critical factors: (1) the degree of vocational choice crystallization; and (2) the individual's personal characteristics, dynamics and life style.

Specifically, it is the organization of a family's problematic interpersonal response patterns into a hierarchy, followed by systematic relearning of appropriate response interchanges. BTFS involves five sets of operations: (1) specifying problem areas of the family system; (2) ranking the problems; (3)  outlining the plan of therapy; (4) analyzing problematic response patterns and modeling appropriate alternatives; and (5) rehearsing appropriate response interchanges.

The second suggests that, where paraprofessionals are involved, the bulk of supervision should be directed at enhancing their growth. Supervision is viewed as the key to an ongoing evaluation program. Traditional selection procedures are critically evaluated in the third paper and the work of the New Careers movement and that of Carkhuff (1969) set down as promising models for selecting paraprofessionals. In the fourth paper, a general outline for training is presented. Both general skills (e.g., interpersonal) and specific skills (e.g., those which  are job-related) are viewed as essential.

He draws heavily on Fritz Heider for his phenomenological analysis, by which he means an analysis of learning based solidly and integrally on what can be simply seen by all men. The paper distinguishes a learning process found in the developing child, called maturational learning, which is not found in the adult. In addition, it considers three learning processes common to children and adults: (1) learning to do things; (2) acquiring knowledge; and (3) learning to go along with people or in groups. The author concludes that, of the different learning processes which he discusses, social learning is by far the least clear perceptually, and the most mysterious conceptually.  (TL)",

The need for standards is viewed in terms of both public and professional concerns for the psychological safety of participating students. The following are elaborated: (1) minimal entry level criteria; (2) additional full trainer status criteria; (3) criteria for measuring a trainer's interpersonal skills; and (4) criteria for maintaining full trainer status. The second paper considers the haphazard and inconsistent way in which drug and sex education policies are formulated  and implemented. Essential elements of effective policy development are summarized: (1) goals of the institution; (2) the channeling of resources; (3) the framework for decision making; (4) a guide to action; and (5) collection of data. Such a policy would, in the author's opinion, facilitate the institutional commitment to drug and sex education. (TL)",

Three types of stimuli were used: (1) visual judgments; (2) opinion statements; and (3) delay of gratification preferences. Age-trends were observed for unanimous peer pressure, adult influence, and peer pressure with social support from a partner. Unanimous peer pressure yielded decreasing conformity across age, being more pronounced for males than for females. Adult influence declined over age for both sexes. Social support from a partner who gave correct or modal answers reduced conformity to a constant low level across all ages. The report concludes that mechanisms of group influence are highly similar across age, and that age trends may reflect  variations in situational factors associated with age differences. Hence, the variable of age may be of limited value, in itself, in studying peer influence. (Author/TL)",

Two additional measures were included to test the possible relationship between strength and \"arousal\". Thirty-three graduate students were measured for Absolute Visual Threshold, Auditory Threshold, 2-Flash Threshold and Reaction Time, with the remaining variables derived by systematically varying experimental conditions. A factor analysis provided no clear-cut support for a dimension of strength although a number of less pervasive factors were obtained.

Reputationalists find an economically dominated power elite. They picture a community's power and influence structure as pyramidal -- the power elite forming a monolithic power pyramid. Thus, according to reputationalists, only a select few run the affairs of the community. The pluralists, on the other hand, assume that influence is specialized and that people act primarily in areas of major interest. Consequently, for pluralists, no single group dominates the community, and those people who are influential in one sector of public activity tend to be noninfluential in another. However, both schools of thought agree on one fundamental point:  very few citizens actually participate in the community's decisionmaking processes. (Author)",

        "description":"Wages in the private sector are generally determined by labor supply and demand. In education, wages are frequently conditioned by political processes leading to severe irrationality in the salary policies of the institution. Hypotheses were tested that saw a school district's salary level as a function of the community's socioeconomic, cultural, and educational statuses; the levels of teacher experience; teacher training; and other teacher quality characteristics. Surveys showed that teacher salaries were unrelated to a community's cultural and educational levels and to the level of teacher training. Salaries varied directly with teacher experience and with community socioeconomic status except in very low status communities. Teaching quality was related to teacher salaries, but  the direction of the relationship varied with the measure of quality. From an economic perspective, teacher salaries in New York State are determined irrationally and without information as to the influence of teacher quality on the learning process. (RA)",

In Venezuela, the national school system was highly centralized with even routine decisions being made in Caracas, which resulted in a rigid, unresponsive relationship between local men and government officials. In Colombia, State and local units were relatively autonomous, and government funds were divided among these units so that control over allocations of educational money and enforcement of standard teacher qualification requirements were in the hands of the local units. In both countries, decentralization programs were designed that set up a series of regional offices to strike a better  balance between local and national authorities. (RA)",

Study results indicate that the pattern of events in school and community appears to reflect the pattern occurring throughout the nation. High schools and communities are in a state of transition, but the active, decisionmaking role of the schools in curriculum, instruction, and organization indicates the school's ability to provide more broadly based, individualized programs that include additional  options for students.

The conditions provided that each group be internally heterogeneous, but that intergroup differences be small, so that each would represent a separate replication of the same experiment. The allocation was to mirror uniformly the central tendency and variability of the overall student population. This method could apply to a more flexible set of initial conditions: it could accommodate another variable, be equally useful for ensuring representation across socioeconomic or cultural variables, and obtain proportionality with the racial-ethnic mix of the student  population considered.

Data on structure, content, and determinants of attitudes of over 3,000 persons in seven countries were gathered. Concentrated upon were four groups: special education rehabilitation workers, regular teachers, parents of the retarded, and parents of the non-retarded. The instrument consisted of a facet theory derived six level attitude scale and questionnaire. Data are analyzed in terms of the relationship of attitude to the following predictor variables: values, knowledge of retardation, amount of  contact with retarded, religiosity, age and education, openness to change, group membership, and multidimensionality. Data showed that attitudes at the action-behavior levels have an affective-value-contactual basis rather than a cognitive-knowledge one. Data also proved that the ABS-MR attitude-levels do exhibit a simplex structure, that selected variables are effective predictors of attitude-behaviors, that the ABS-MR can differentiate between groups having different degrees of favorableness of attitude, and that it is cross-culturally equivalent and comparable.

Characteristics and numbers of such children, and literature reporting some methods and experiences in educating trainable mentally retarded (TMR) children are reviewed. Four public school TMR classes currently in operation in St. Paul and Minneapolis are described. Also summarized are available followup studies on TMR children documenting their adult status, including one detailed followup study done on children who attended St. Paul classes. Two chapters deal with studies conducted in Minnesota on the attitudes, hopes, and experiences of parents of TMR children. The subjects in one study consisted of parents of retarded  children enrolled in the Minneapolis-St. Paul classes, while the other study surveyed only parents whose children were not in public school classes. A final discussion on the problems of day school care concludes that public day school programs for TMR children can be established and maintained, but also points out that evidence is inconclusive as to whether such classes represent the best or most valuable type of program. Summarized are divergent professional points of view and the reasons for them. (KW)",

Evaluated were two experimental groups numbering 12 and 22 persons (mean ages 10 years 7 months and 10 years 2 months) who had been enrolled in two different community centered programs for 1-6 years (mean of 3 years), and a control group of 20 subjects (mean age 9 years 9 months) waiting to be enrolled. The TMR Performance Profile, a descriptive behavioral measure, was used to assess subjects' abilities in five major areas of daily activities: social behavior, self-care, communication, basic knowledge, and body usage. Both experimental groups scored significantly  higher than the control group in all areas except self-care, in which only one experimental group scored significantly higher. It is concluded that systematic training programs as exemplified by the community centered concept significantly improve the skills and functioning of the TMR and that the development of such community centered programs is justified.

Increasing the relevance of course content is seen to be possible through thematic or generic structuring of content based on significant works of literature and by concern with communication in all its forms and via all media. Discovery methods similar to those used in newer physical science courses are recommended, as are communications or media laboratories,  for promoting an inductive study of language in all its forms of communication and for relating course content to the needs of gifted students in this age and to the development of high-level skills.

Concepts, generalizations and themes of the social sciences are examined as they relate to principles of teaching social science to gifted children. Emphasis is upon productive thinking, creative thinking, problem solving, and a blending of cognitive-affective skills. The concern is expressed that, rather than merely learning simple inquiry training, gifted students experience productive thinking through behaving like social scientists and that they conceive of themselves as problem-solving thinkers. Social science skills are examined (conceptual models, behavioral skills,  evaluative and creative skills). Higher intellectual skills are considered in a chapter discussing several theoretical frameworks for examining thinking abilities. Creative persons and the creative process are briefly discussed in relation to teacher strategies. Thoughts on the contribution of the social sciences to the development of the gifted child's potential conclude the booklet. (Author/KW)",

Programs were categorized for analysis purposes into California Programs, New Programs (in operation for 12 months or less), and Old Programs. Analysis of data showed the majority of non-California programs in Texas and Florida. Clients in Old Programs had short lengths of stay (mean of 22 months), used public facilities and contributed to own maintenance in 60% of the cases, and went independently to jobs in over half of the cases. New Programs resembled Old Programs except that over 60% of the New were integrated by sex.  Although 51 halfway houses were found outside California, not one for the mildly retarded was found in California. The sample of existing California Programs (Family Homes and Resident Facilities) were characterized by fewer residents, longer stays, lower estimated IQ, little community involvement, and lower level of self-maintenance. Patients were not normalized to the extent of residents in other programs. (KW)",

Hierarchical levels of psychobiologic deficiency and corresponding condition variables are given for the various physically handicapping conditions which result in non-ambulation. Information on performance characteristics is intended to be used in design research for determining abilities and needs of specific non-ambulatory groups at all levels of non-ambulation and for determining the characteristics which the proposed dynamic artificial aids must possess. A case study using the data provided is included to illustrate that a  psychobiologic approach to design is possible and to indicate the type of reasoning which needs to be followed in developing design solutions.

        "description":"Examined were relationships among various verbal and nonverbal personality scales purporting to measure extent to which an individual behaves as if he, or the environment, controls events. Also investigated were developmental trends related to this internal-external dimension of personality and its relation to academic achievement of the educable mentally retarded (EMR). Subjects were 215 EMR children (ages 9-15 years, IQ range 45-82), who were administered a battery of six tests. The hypotheses that there would be a significant relationship among the personality measures at all age levels across settings, and that there would be a developmental trend across the age span involved, moving from an external to internal frame of reference as age increased, were not sustained. It was  concluded that internal and external dimensions of personality play a minimal role in the academic achievement of EMR students as compared to the roles played by MA and CA.

The APSTRAT (derived from &quot;aptitude&quot; and &quot;strategies&quot;) model is designed to train men at many levels of aptitude and with wide differences in educational backgrounds for a variety of tasks. The model, which is now undergoing tests, simulates on-the-job training. The central feature of the model is its use of peer instruction, which has been found to be both practical and efficient. For each task, the trainee passes through this cycle: observation of the task being performed, learning the task, job-performance (in which the trainee is observed by a new trainee), and teaching (in which the trainee instructs another). The trainee  passes through this cycle until he has learned each task thoroughly, as judged by observation and testing administered by the instructor. A prototype of this model has proved successful in preliminary tests, but it is not yet established whether it is generally suitable for the wide variety of application for which it is intended.

The occupations selected to be filmed were considered to have growth potential and to be open to non-college bound students. It was found that the films could be photographed by a graduate student directly on 8 mm. film according to a professionally prepared script with little or no editing. This was important because the first three films prepared by a commercial studio proved to be too expensive. The sound track for the films was tape recorded on a cassette. Starting the film projector and the tape recorder at the same time provided a sufficiently synchronized effect for instructional purposes. When  the films were shown to some 1322 middle-school students, the majority of the students rated them as a good or excellent method of learning about occupations. The acceptance of the films varied somewhat with the sex of the student and the film content. The major criticism was the desire for more information. Their simple presentation form allowed the films to be used in an individualized instructional setting. (JY)",

One instrument, termed manipulative, used a programed text with objects and artifacts that the students handled during instruction. The other instrument, termed non-manipulative, used a programed text with pictures of objects and artifacts used in the manipulative instrument. Two tests were developed to measure learning achievement. One test was a series of \"fill-in-the-blank\" questions; the other test required the students to use clay to demonstrate their understanding of the art concepts. When these instruments were used with 112 out of 516 students who  had been identified as having either high-verbal-low-motor or low-verbal-high-motor ability traits, it was found that there was no significant correlation between short-term learning and instructional treatment. However, significant correlations were found between retention and instructional treatment and between testing methods and ability traits. One practical classroom application of the results is that it is important for the means of demonstrating learning (testing) to be related to the individual student's ability traits. (JY)",

The possible uses for an ITV system and some overall planning considerations are surveyed. The test pattern concept for assessing the quality of a television picture is explained, and descriptive definitions offered of some basic ITV terms, such as broadcast quality, cable television, microwave, etc. Planning considerations for studios and studio equipment are outlined. Transmission  options--open-circuit, cable, instructional television fixed service--are described, as are the links in the television reception chain--preamplifiers, modulated radio frequency systems, etc. Quadraplex videotape recorders are compared with slant-track recorders. Advice on preparing for color capability and on assembling an ITV staff is given. A basic planning pattern details the personnel who should be involved in the design stage and estimates the initial costs of an ITV system. (JY)",

C., in 1967 by the Association for Educational Data Systems and the U.S. Office of Education, attempted to lay the groundwork for an efficient automatic data processing training program for the Federal Government utilizing new instructional methodologies. The rapid growth of computer applications and computer use was cited as the reason for the overwhelming need for such a training program. Specific needs for data processing personnel in the Federal Government were considered with special attention to the need for systems analysts and managers. Training needs for data processing personnel in higher education and industry were also identified. Training objectives for managers and systems analysts were outlined as a basis for defining  subject-matter content. The structure and content for curricula for a management training program and a systems analyst training program were agreed upon. The possibility that new educational media, particularly computer-assisted instruction (CAI), could be used in this training program was examined. A request for proposals for a pilot project to conduct training in data processing for the Federal Government was drawn up.

Technical students, who have to master long and difficult courses, present special motivational problems. A review of the literature indicates that motivators for technical students can be classified under three main headings: task-related or \"intrinsic\" factors, need-related or \"dynamic\" determinants, and external rewards. It appears that elements of these motivators may be useful in encouraging CAI students in technical courses. To illustrate the application of motivating factors, a potential system which utilizes techniques from all three classes of motivators is proposed, first in the  context of a military training course in radar repair and then in a job training program for disadvantaged youth. The system classifies students according to certain dynamic variables such as need achievement. Other features of the system include rewards of time off or cash for successful learning and student participation in goal-setting. (Author/JY)",

Problem solving and electronic data processing skills are the principal classroom instructional uses; mathematics is most often the subject area taught with the assistance of a computer. Computers have shown a great ability to motivate students. They are more frequently used as an aid in instruction than as the object of instruction. Most financial support for computer programs in schools comes from the local  level and is expected to continue to do so in the future.

The profected production capacity coupled with the recommended ITV team formed the basis for an estimate of personnel needs. Two training programs were then  projected: one which would permit upgrading the skills of existing personnel and one which would not.

The simulator, which will run on any computer with even a limited FORTRAN IV capability, simulates a single address, six decimal machine with 15 basic instructions, nine index registers, and 1000 memory locations. It is capable of taking any problem and a solution prepared by the instructor and using that solution as a standard against which student problems and solutions are automatically compared and graded. The instructor can specify the  weighting of factors he considers important in the grading. Diagnostic information is provided to the student on practice runs. A second system, called an Assembly Monitor, provides for the running of student machine language programs on any IBM 1130 computer. It provides a protection system against novice programers destroying resident programs and, in addition, supplies debugging aids and a grading system very much like that for SIM 610. (JY)",

The primary focus of the study was an evaluation of two mathematics programs--one adapted from an American program and one developed locally for teaching mathematics to low-ability elementary-school students. The teachers who used these programed materials had little training or experience in using programed materials. On the whole, the programed materials were successful in teaching the subject and were helpful in eliminating the large difference between low- and high-ability students. In an ex post facto study of students in a vocational high school who had used programed mathematics materials, similar results were found. A few introductory lessons  in English as a foreign language were developed and tried out informally on two fifth-grade students with limited success. These studies suggest, in particular, that the two mathematics programs developed thus far may be used to an advantage in Israeli schools with large populations of culturally deprived students and, in general, that further development of programed materials for use at the elementary and the high school level in Israel is warranted.

The National Center, through this board, will review, acquire, and disseminate completed instructional television (ITV) courses. The staff of the Project in conjunction with curriculum committees, instructional television personnel, and school service personnel developed three series of programs which will be produced when funds are available: social studies for elementary school students, humanities for secondary school students, and educational news for teachers. Quality ITV programs produced in the northeast region were identified for possible distribution  and exchange through the Eastern Educational Network. The Project coordinated such information dissemination activities as demonstrations, workshops, and newsletters and also aided in the evaluation of instructional television programs throughout the Northeast Region. The goal of the Project is a self-supporting regional instructional television service. (JY)",

        "description":"The effects of the availability of behaviorally stated objectives on the learning process were studied. It was hypothesized that objectives would serve as orienting stimuli which would help students to attend to, process, and organize relevant aspects of displayed information in accordance with stated objectives. Therefore, the presentation of objectives was expected to reduce the number of examples and the amount of time required to learn the task, to facilitate performance on transfer retrieval criterion measures, and to reduce the requirements for memory and reasoning abilities. The learning task consisted of a hierarchical imaginary science called the science of Xenograde systems (see EM 009 053). It was presented by an IBM 1500/1800 computer-assisted instruction system to  130 introductory educational psychology and science education students. Subjects were randomly assigned to an example-only group, an objective-example group, a rule-example group, or an objective-rule-example group. A significant rule effect was found in that the rule groups needed less time and fewer examples than the no-rule groups. Objectives significantly reduced the number of examples required to learn the task, but did not reduce total latency. Objectives and/or rules also effected a reduction in the requirement for reasoning ability. (Author/JY)",

The major purpose of this research was to develop theorems of instruction related to the interaction of task variables and individual difference variables and to develop them in a manner relevant to the instructional designer's task. The studies focused on the relationship of cognitive abilities to the learning of concepts and rules and to the learning of an imaginary science of \"Xenograde systems.\" The goal was to establish a theoretical and methodological continuum from simple concept learning, through the learning of a complex system of concepts and rules, to a set of instructional design procedures which permit transfer of  this knowledge into practice. On the basis of the studies a model for research in this area was recommended, cognitive processes relevant for concept and rule learning were defined, and a hypothesis construction model of simple concept learning was outlined, along with proposed theoretical considerations for more complex concept learning and specific recommendations for instructional design utilizing differences in intellectual abilities.

The new method was found to have good reliability of sequence determination. An index, called the hierarchical sequence conformity index (HSCI), was constructed for quantifying the degree of conformity of the sequence of a particular presentation to the sequence determined by the information processing task analysis. When the HSCI was used to study the effect of three cognitive abilities (induction, reasoning, and memory) the results indicated that: induction  appeared to contribute to performance on disordered sequences of instruction, reasoning ability affected performance on self-selected sequences, and memory appeared to have no effect on performance. Since selection of one's own sequence did not produce an increase in performance or interest, a predetermined hierarchical sequence may achieve the desired instructional goal as efficiently.

One viewer with an adjustable horizontal screen has a normal magnification rate and is mounted on a desk top. The other viewer has a high (4x) magnification rate in a mini-theater configuration with remote microfiche positioning controls. The matte surface screen is believed to be an improvement over conventional screens. Both viewers utilize conventional projection optics to maintain image contrast in controlled lighting environments. Interference between the user and the projected light is virtually eliminated by oblique projection achieved by simple, practical techniques. A survey of users shows a marked preference for the mini-theater viewer  over conventional near projection viewers. Two control modes for positioning microfiche were developed for the mini-theater viewer: a velocity-control system and a position-control system. A comparison of these two modes shows that users prefer the position-control system. A survey of fiber optics, photochromic materials, and conventional optics for possible use in a small portable, and self-powered viewer shows that conventional optics with clever packaging will best meet the design needs.

The characteristics of a disadvantaged student's family structure, home environment, and neighborhood all affect his learning potential. The special needs of disadvantaged students suggest that, particularly in the field of mathematics instruction, modern electronic technology will be helpful. Computers may be especially useful in that they allow the program of instruction to be individualized to suit the student's needs. Experience with computer-assisted instruction (CAI) drill-and-practice programs such as those developed by the Institute for Mathematical Studies in Social Science, by the IBM Watson Research  Center, and by RCA indicates that improvements in performance and student and teacher attitudes may be expected when CAI is used with disadvantaged students. CAI can be useful in overcoming negative teacher attitudes toward disadvantaged students, in teaching students to follow instructions, and in stimulating student interest. CAI would seem to be an important tool to be used to overcome learning problems created by a deprived environment. A table listing CAI programs for the disadvantaged is provided. (JY)",

After an introductory discussion of some basic principles of instructional programing, this first volume focuses on the system analysis phase, describing some major sub-phases within the program construction process. The current trends in the choice of areas where instructional programing may be used are identified. A systematic method of determining instructional goals is recommended: first searching for goals with empirical and comprehensive means, then focusing on goals which are behavior oriented and non-conflicting, and, finally, adjusting goals in a series of successive,  post-checking revisions. The necessity for an analysis of the special characteristics of the intended student population and the external restrictions on the use of the study material is stressed. Some procedures for examining the logical and psychological structure of the subject matter are presented. The mechanical and non-mechanical devices available to present an instructional system are described and evaluated, including programed texts, closed-circuit television, and teaching machines.

In addition, the Mexican-American children were evaluated on Spanish comprehension, Spanish production, Spanish phonology, Spanish intonation, and Spanish syntax. For each scaled  evaluation, evaluators provided a description of their bases for judgment. Evaluators responded to open-ended questions regarding instructional needs, reading achievement, and overall reactions.

        "description":"This study is concerned with misarticulated speech sounds of children and the phonetic realization of these sounds. The articulation errors of 384 standard-English-speaking school children were analyzed in speech samples obtained by the National Speech and Hearing Survey and were samples of both free speech and of performance on the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation. Error rates and incidence of various types of errors (omissions, distortions, and substitutions) by grade level were noted. The major thrust of the investigation, however, was an attempt to explain the substitution errors in the sample using the constructs of distinctive feature theory and markedness theory. The hypothesis presented in and confirmed by this study is that when substitution errors occur, less  complex phonemes will be substituted for more complex ones. The data analyzed in the present study suggest that substitutions are governed in part by a tendency toward ease of articulation with constraints imposed upon substitutions by a tendency to maximize perceptual distinctions in the speech output. The phonetic features themselves were found to be of varying degrees of stability. Tables and charts are included. (Author/RL)",

Corollary recommendations covered in the report include: (1) increasing the entrance requirement from two to three years providing there is substantial improvement in the quality of secondary school instruction, (2) expanding the counseling services to explain to the freshmen the full nature and rationale of the  requirement, and (3) combining the rhetoric and the foreign language requirements, calling it the Language Arts Requirement.

A. program at San Francisco State College was established in 1963 and has graduated over a hundred teachers. A number of developments, particularly in general linguistic theory, in language acquisition and bilingualism, and in social dialects, have affected the profession significantly. The program at San Francisco State, so far as its array of course work and requirements is concerned, appears to have changed little since its beginning. Yet adjustments have been made because of the accumulated experience of the staff, changes in the local population of non-English speakers, and developments in the profession  generally. This paper attempts to describe and evaluate the San Francisco program by considering where it has been, where it is, and where it might be going. (Author)",

        "description":"This study supports the hypothesis that educated white listeners react negatively to the phonological variations of non-standard English. White college freshmen and seniors listened to a recorded tape of ten speakers, black and white with standard and non-standard styles of pronunciation, all reading the same passage. Students were asked to judge on phonological variations alone ten characteristics as well as the races and probable occupations of the speakers. Although all the speakers were educated, half, both black and white, spoke with a non-standard southern style of pronunciation. Non-standard speakers of both races were rated significantly lower overall on the characteristics than their Standard speaking counterparts. However, stereotypes included higher ratings on  friendliness and honesty. Non-standard speakers were also perceived as black members of the working or lower classes, and Standard speakers were perceived as being white professionals. The situations observed in conducting such a study were as revealing as the statistical findings of the study itself: the typical reactions of southern speakers to the suggestion that they had such a speech style, the hesitancy in reading of all black speakers, the minor differences in perception between the freshmen and the seniors, and the reactions of the college students when confronted with their stereotypes.

A December 1970 Gallup Poll indicated that in a roughly random sample of college students, 42 percent had tried marijuana at least once, double the figure of spring 1969, and a figure that is terrifying indeed, if the amotivational syndrome is to be believed. Studies correlating college student use of illegal drugs and grades do not, however, support the amotivational syndrome view. A survey of six hundred students attending a deviance and delinquency class at Stony Brook indicated that 7 out of 10 had used amphetamines, and 4 percent had used heroin. The GPA's of the marijuana smokers and abstainers were roughly identical. There appeared to  be a slight curvilinear relationship between drug use and grades. The highest grades seemed to be earned by the casual marijuana smoker, and the lowest grades by both the heaviest users of drugs, as well as the abstainer. Grades tended to dip with students heavily involved with drugs, with the heroin user having the lowest percentage of B average or better. Three variables: sex, class in college, and parents' socioeconomic status, were introduced and were found to have no effect on these findings. (AF)",

        "description":"Secondary schools have traditionally looked to higher education for guidance and leadership, yet they might do better looking elsewhere. Instead of teaching being considered a plum, it is considered a burden, and outstanding faculty may be lured to an institution with the promise of no undergraduate classes. Colleges base their reputation often on the achievement of their graduates, ignoring the fact that their selective admission policies practically assure the success of a good portion of their students who already possess all the needed attributes before they even enter college. Arguments against open admission policies include the fear of lowering academic standards, but academic standards should not be measured by the number of educationally superior students admitted, but  by the success the institution has in educating its students for life and in contributing to the students' personal development. Procedures should be established for evaluating institutions and their effectiveness should be measured by taking into account the students' initial level of performance and improvement in performance over time. Evaluation of faculty members is also essential, and one way would be to administer a departmental test to all students taking a particular course and to apply multiple criteria of performance, including the progress the individual student has made.

Discussed are: (1) computer capabilities and costs, in terms of hardware and software, and two major trends in computing that hold special promise for instruction with the computer: large centralized computing facilities, and small, inexpensive minicomputers; (2) the provision of computer service in terms of four choices: a centralized campus facility; decentralized campus facilities; regional networks; and commercial time-sharing service; (3) the provision of instructional materials, including the current situation, and the suggestion that commercial time-sharing systems and small, inexpensive computers could offer the means to use these  materials that could be produced and distributed on the same basis as textbooks are now; and (4) how these developments would affect higher education.

It summarizes the earlier character of student leftism and describes how the &quot;New Left&quot; developed, its constellation of beliefs, and its tactics and objectives. A principal conclusion is that hard-core student activists quite consciously seek confrontations and that university officials frequently play into the hands of the dissidents by calling the police before trying other alternatives for resolving the conflict. Accordingly, this essay suggests the critical importance of developing new strategies of the types that lead to the management of conflict within institutionalized democratic procedures. (Author)",

The sample included black collegians (477 men and 837 women) who had been nominated by their high schools for participation in the first annual National Achievement Scholarship Program and who responded to a 1966 followup survey, following their freshman year of college. When men and women were grouped in five types of colleges, statistically significant correlations were found between scores on the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (NMSQT) and freshman grades. The most striking result was the inverse relationship between average college grades and average NMSQT scores. In general, students in the  largely black colleges had lower NMSQT scores but received higher freshman grades, while the opposite pattern prevailed at primarily white colleges. (Author/AF)",

The relationships between the  independent and dependent variables were analyzed by means of a completely randomized 2X2X2X2X factorial of variance. The results indicated that non-science majors had a significantly higher GPA than did science majors, and that there was a statistically significant interaction between transfer status and the division enrolled: transfer students did better in the Division of Professional Studies, while the native did better in the Division of Arts and Sciences.

Of the 254 students who selected the option, 75 percent received credit; it appeared that students had a better chance of receiving credit if they were more advanced in class ranking. Generally, students who elected a course on the credit-no credit basis were better than average students. Results of a questionnaire sent to students participating in the option indicated that students used the option  primarily to reduce pressure for a grade, but also (about 40 percent) to explore outside their area of interest. Most students said they did as much work in the credit-no credit course as in a regularly graded course, though they agreed the option did remove some of the pressure for a grade.

Information was obtained from all students from Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria attending Pacific Coast institutions. The results of the survey indicated that more than half of the respondents favored educational change in the African countries. Forty-eight percent of the pro-change group favored the establishment of indigenous universities, because they believed that those institutions represented the formula for resolving the problems of contemporary African nations. Only 8 percent favored the stable continuity of  the existing colleges and universities. Those who tended to see economic development, educational needs, tribalism, and national unity as very serious problems confronting their society favored educational change, while those who did not take these problems as very serious tended to support the status quo. In addition, the large majority of those who favored &quot;Africanization&quot; of higher education were in favor of educational change and wanted the creation of indigenous institutions.

Because conventional grades do not serve these functions adequately, they rarely reflect the student's true potential or the student's real academic strength and weaknesses. Studies have also shown that there is no evidence that conventional grades are better  predictors of future academic success than are nonconventional grades.

Four factors were interpreted to involve Size, Affluence, Technical Emphasis, and High Cost - Private Control. The EAT profile scores are closely tied to theory, appear to reveal meaningful differences in emphasis by Japanese universities on subject matter areas, and are related in meaningful ways to the factor environment measures. Thus, both procedures yielded results that are reasonably clear and meaningful. Moreover,  the pattern of these results is generally similar to the pattern of results in the United States, but with differences that appear related to the organization of higher education in the United States.

        "description":"The main objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the degree to which SAT scores and high school grades were effective in predicting the freshman grades of disadvantaged/minority students; (2) to examine the validity of these same predictor variables for subgroups of minority freshmen formed on the basis of sex, ethnic background and &quot;risk&quot; admission status; and (3) to determine if the use of a common white regression equation for minority students either over or underpredicted their actual performance. The data was obtained from 200 minority students enrolled in the 1968 Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) and in the College of Letter and Science (CLS) at 2 University of California campuses. These data were cross validated with findings observed for entering 1969 EOP  groups, and randomly selected control populations of over 600 CLS freshmen were added for purposes of comparison. The results showed that the high school average was the best overall predictor of college grades for both minority and white freshmen. SAT-V was a more consistent positive predictor for white than for minority students. Minority and white female SAT-V correlations were generally higher than those for males; and the predictor variables correlated poorer for EOP &quot;risk&quot; groups than for other groups.

Fourteen other states: California, New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Vermont, Connecticut, Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma  and Massachusetts have centralized subsystems within the state, each under a single governing board whose jurisdiction is confined to its own cluster of institutions. Since junior colleges in most states continue to be based on local taxing districts from which they derive part of their tax support, in addition to getting substantial aid funds from the state, they cannot be said to constitute a totally centralized subsystem.

These include: (1) policy and structural changes to promote increased involvement of women in academic life at  all levels and in all fields; (2) program and service changes to facilitate life on campus for women, such as the provision of child-care facilities on campus, and campus health services for women; and (3) academic changes, including the institution of a series of courses or major programs of female studies.

Part II presents resolutions for the establishment of All-College committees to replace parallel faculty and student committees. Following rejection of the College Cabinet and bicameral legislature, new proposals for a College Senate were submitted. The proposals and a summary of the committee's reasoning appear in Part III.

Students identified by guidance counselors were informed by FAIT personnel of the availability of funds for higher education. A source book containing pertinent information on each student was sent to all post-secondary schools in Georgia and contiguous states to encourage institutions to recruit disadvantaged students. This study examines the 2,777 graduated FAIT students. A questionnaire sent to a representative sample of the 57.5% reportedly enrolled in some type of post-secondary institution elicited responses from 41.4%. Among the results, it was found that sex and race were related to continuation  of a student's education; white FAIT students and male FAIT students were more likely to attend. White FAIT students tended to enroll in public 4-year schools while black FAIT students enrolled generally in private 4-year colleges. Financial aid was received by 50%; 57% of the blacks and 31% of the whites reported difficulty in securing aid. (JS)",

The purpose of the project described in this report was to produce a 22-minute instructional film that would enhance curricula in composite materials and to involve students in a mission-oriented project. Classes divided into 3-man teams assumed major responsibility for planning, researching, filming, and narrating parts of the film.

Directionless institutions in this revolutionary era are likely to surrender to factional pressures and to misplace priorities. Perhaps the position of the president should be modified since neither academic nor managerial skills are sufficient to manage the modern university. We have failed to define the role and qualifications of the board of trustees, which shares responsibility for guiding institutions. Lack of managerial abilities and a complete understanding of and dedication to institutional needs and objectives by  trustees and president can leave an institution floundering and defenseless. Both trustees and presidents should be accountable for their performance. As guidelines for mutual evaluation, 22 questions are suggested for the presidential candidate to ask the board, and 28 for the board to ask the presidential candidate. (Author/JS)",

A total of 28,800 National Merit Scholar Qualifying Test participants were selected to compose 72 subsamples formed on the basis of race (black or nonblack), sex, ability level, and geographical region of residence. The return rate was 64% and was related to students' NMSQT selection scores, highest for those with the highest scores. It was concluded that marriage seems a more important factor in the college attendance behavior of nonblack than black males. Marital status of a woman of either race is especially significant as a determinant of college attendance; a married woman  is less likely to attend than her male counterpart. Marriage can also affect the type of college entered, the grades received, and completion of the freshman year. The data are illustrated in tables. (JS)",

A faculty member's total workload consists of three different assignments: teaching, research, and public service. The average faculty member spends from 50 to 55 hours each week in these pursuits. The time spent in teaching is usually expressed in terms of contact hours and credit hours which, in turn, are controlled by three factors: (1) the class level of the student; (2) the accustomed or accepted methods of teaching; and (3) the nature of the subject matter. In addition, in assessing teaching loads it is also necessary to have information on: (1) the number of contact hours per week taught in each school according to the academic trade of the faculty member; and (2) the  teaching load based on the full-time equivalent faculty position. The teaching load of the research professor should be assessed on an individual basis. Other measures used in consideration of faculty workload discussed in this paper are: teacher-student ratio, class size, and student credit hours per full-time equivalent faculty. (AF)",

        "description":"This study identified prior career experiences of 612 junior college faculty in 10 of 12 junior colleges in Pennsylvania and investigated the relationship between identified career experiences and faculty attitudes toward progressive-traditional education issues. Attention was given to the prior career experiences that faculty members felt had the greatest influence on forming their attitudes toward education. These experiences were classified as (1) degree held; and (2) the kind of institutions they were last affiliated with (public school, junior college, 4-year college, graduate school, or business and industry). Kerlinger's Education Scale VII (ESVII) was the measurement inventory used in the study. It was found that: (1) there are statistically significant differences  between the subjective pre-organizational career pattern classification of faculty and their attitudes toward educational issues; (2) attitudes of faculty toward education issues do not vary according to the number of jobs held; (3) there is a significant relationship between selected biographical characteristics of faculty, especially academic field and age, and attitudes toward educational issues. It was concluded that community college leaders must try harder to recruit progressive faculty by developing closer contacts with those in graduate study and/or from 4-year institutions. The questionnaire used in the study is included. (CA)",

It offered a successful alternative to traditional and remedial courses, as shown by measures of grades, essay ratings, and national achievement tests. The following recommendations supported the project's objectives: (1) development of a composition course for students who are above the remedial level but not yet ready for the usual freshman English; (2) extension of time and careful structuring of  composition courses for some students; (3) use of beginning lessons as a practical orientation to college; (4) consideration of male attitudes toward courses; (5) granting partial credit for slower-paced courses; (6) careful selection and scheduling of instructors; and (7) assurance of stability of testing and placement conditions before a long-range experiment is begun.

Data were gathered from the Illinois Junior College Board and Bureau of the Budget, and from questionnaires sent to the 1968 graduates of three junior colleges in areas of high youth unemployment and of two junior colleges in areas of low youth unemployment. Researchers were able to account for 55.2 per cent of variables influencing earning capacity. The major variable categories were individual, college, family, and job. Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) uniform cost accounting procedures are needed to permit meaningful analysis of comparable data among colleges; (2) influence of the variable&quot;hours worked per week while in college&quot; on earnings indicates that occupation-oriented males may gain a great deal from work experiences that result in future earnings; (3) junior colleges should have on-going follow-up and evaluation programs in all occupational training areas; (4) the colleges should be sensitive to the needs of their constituents; (5) adequate vocational guidance programs should be developed to assist the student and his parents in making an occupational choice; and (6) scholarship programs should be re-evaluated on the basis of effectiveness in assisting individuals in their goal achievement.

        "description":"Fundamental adjustments in the educational philosophy and practices of private junior colleges are essential to their survival. There is a great need for public awareness of the private junior college's economic plight, which is due to rising costs and non-competitive prices for students and salaries for faculty. A major purpose of this monograph is to see how the private purposes of private junior colleges are relevant to contemporary public policies in junior college education. The private junior college, being a relatively free agent, is suited to the role of a prototype for the future 2-year college; however, the concepts of equal opportunity, accountability, and individualized instruction must be incorporated into its institutional style. The case study of Mitchell College  (North Carolina) shows how the cooperative efforts of trustees, administration, and faculty succeeded in redirecting the purposes and style of a private junior college. It was found that (1) a junior college must be oriented to the needs of the public interest; and (2) individual institutions need local and national organizations to promote and protect their interests.

A case study of Coast Community College District (California) is presented: five broad administrative programs are discussed; cost comparisons are examined for different instructional programs; and three techniques of comparing instructional effectiveness, (normative, summative, and informal evaluation) are presented. The paper concludes that instructional innovation can be performed only by faculty  members, but administrators are needed to provide an organizational environment receptive to and actively promoting innovation. A great need is seen for cost accounting systems to serve educational institutions. The summative method of evaluation is the most informative but also the most difficult to perform.

It was found that although Harcum student's parents have a higher educational level, there were no significant differences between the two groups of students in the ranking of nine educational goals. Neither group associated the more personal goals with their formal schooling. In terms of frequency of selection, the most valued experience  categories for Harcum students were all directly concerned with academic matters. The most valued experience categories selected by Harrisburg students included personal experiences as well as those relating to academic matters.

Teaching religion, especially the history and study of comparative religions, is considered legal as long as neutrality is guaranteed. Studies must neither advance nor inhibit certain religious beliefs. Religious studies can be academically presented in a cultural, social, historical, literary, and/or artistic sense. A scientific examination as well as a reflective, expansional treatment should be used. Options on form and structure include: (1) each professor treating religion as it arises naturally in his subject matter; (2) offering specific  courses on religion in various departments; or (3) as the author advocates, creation of a separate department or program for religious studies.

The junior colleges should take advantage of the great student potential for positive social action and realize that, in the area of curriculum development, the student can test what he learns in class against the real world. The student populations of the eight colleges in the district are broken down by race, and the volunteer programs examined for: purpose, structure, funding, and the portion of community serviced. No district-wide commitment to student volunteer services was found, but where there are programs, the faculty and administration do support them. The  programs seem to concentrate on improving skills and self-image among disadvantaged members of the community, especially elementary-age children. Most of the programs are loosely structured. The colleges with a high concentration of minorities show weak attempts at operating student volunteer programs. This can be explained partly by other demands on their time and partly because existing minority organizations may not operate through the colleges. There is a wide variance in funding sources.

        "description":"Through the Veysey and the Regional Occupation Program/Regional Occupation Center (ROP/ROC) Acts, junior colleges can assist high school students in gaining skills for immediate employment on high school graduation. In an attempt to develop an early introduction to technical skills, the Veysey Act (initial legislation 1963; amended 1967) allows high school students to attend junior college classes part time with both schools counting attendance, and the student receiving either high school or junior college credit. The ROP/ROC legislation (1963 and subsequent amendments through 1969) encourages county-wide systems of vocational education through regional programs and centers where vocational, technical, and occupational preparation can be extended to more students than can be  served by a single district. Innovations that might encourage students to take occupational classes are: (1) the &quot;career ladder&quot; approach, where students acquire specific skills for entry-level positions, leave school to work, and return for an upgrading of skills for a higher job; and (2) &quot;package learning&quot; or classes of any length that enable the student to enter any time rather than just in September or February.

A major use of the library's computer is to prepare bibliographies of biomedical subjects requested by medical schools, researchers, practitioners, public health officials, and other health professionals. The library is encountering problems responding to such requests. About 2 to 4 weeks is required to process requests, and library officials believe that the requests should be processed in a much shorter time. The longer time presently required is due to the relative slowness inherent in the computer's storage and retrieval system. Limitations in the computer's vocabulary,  inconsistency in indexing procedures, and errors by the people who do the searching have resulted in data that is not responsive to the requests.

Twelve have independent technical service units for processing serials and 26 are dependent libraries. The objective of Phase I of this Project is to identify feasible alternative system configurations and provide a basis for their evaluation so that the contract libraries can select the most workable configuration for intensive design in Phase II. The alternatives must take into consideration three major factors: (1) requirements of the contract libraries, (2) implications of state and national standards and (3) the state-of-the-art of automated library applications in general and serials control systems in particular. Four tasks are defined to fulfill these objectives: (1) a literature review  and bibliography on serials control systems and related topics, (2) the analysis of non-contract libraries and other organizations, (3) the study of current serials systems at the contract libraries and (4) the cost estimate of alternative system configurations. This final report is presented in five sections: (1) conclusions and recommendations, (2) literature review summary and conclusions, (3) report on selected non-contract libraries and other organizations, (4) analysis of current systems at the contract libraries and (5) alternative system configuration costs.

The effectiveness of this particular type of training is shown to be complementary to academic library education, which deals with principles and general practice. Specialized practices and the experience in-service training gives, assume a significance which mere theorizing and background knowledge often fail to bring out. In-service training may serve the further and more important purpose of integrating librarians in their profession; of giving them such a wide scope of experience as to awaken in them various otherwise dormant interests, making them efficient relations officers with a well balanced attitude toward theory and practice. Details such as the working out of in-service  training in relation to organization, specialization, the question of salary and leave, the choice of libraries and criteria for their suitability, length of time and techniques of training, are discussed and the need for the establishment of a center for the organization, direction and promotion of all aspects of librarians' post-professional education, is dealt with. The functions of such a Post-professional Study Center would include the proper conduct and supervision of in-service training, planning of courses and encouragement of higher standards of achievement.

In addition, he should keep abreast of new developments in his particular speciality and related fields. This monograph is a systematic presentation of one aspect of the librarian's post-professional education which is furthered through conferences, clinics, group work, institutes, lectures, staff meetings, symposia, workshops and similar assemblies, whether national or international. It defines the meaning of each of these terms and places the whole  subject in the context of the librarian's constant need of acquaintance with new techniques and developments. It assesses all the advantages the profession can derive through its members' attendance at, and participation in conferences. Each method of interchange of ideas is scrutinized and suggestions are made for the better organization and running of conferences and group activities. Finally, the need for the establishment of a center for the organization, and promotion of all aspects of the librarian's continuing education is discussed. (Author)",

If a distinction is made between traditional information systems such as libraries, documentation services etc., and the wide spectrum of mechanized systems, the inventory aims at retaining all mechanized systems and only important traditional ones. In particular, it includes all systems which are designed as mechanized systems from either a search or storage viewpoint and to which general national access is possible. Some systems are also included which consist of mechanized entry into systems which are based in other countries. Systems to which funds have been committed are also included even if  not yet fully developed. The scope of the inventory includes social sciences and related fields. The indexes included at the beginning of the inventory enable the user to find an entry by its name, acronym, sponsoring body, country, area or field, etc. The present version of this inventory has been prepared on the basis of a joint survey carried out by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

According to the 1961 census, 87% of the male and 75% of the female labor force of Prince Edward Island had grade eight or lower education. Public libraries are the only provincial agencies which can be of any help if the dropouts, functional illiterates and the undereducated decide to continue their education outside the formal classroom. The purposes of this study are: (1) to overview the public library resources and services available to the rural people; (2) to identify the educational and informational needs of this group; (3) the extent to which they are satisfied, also to suggest reasons for which they have failed to satisfy these needs and (4) to suggest measures which can be taken to meet these needs.  To tap the potential of public libraries, it is suggested that the libraries be provided with a foundation in law, and that necessary steps should be taken to meet the minimum standards set by the Canadian Library Association. Other suggestions for securing effective library services are also made. (Author/NH)",

Phase II, consisted of (1) distributing the hardware to the participating physicians, (2) producing and distributing the training program on equipment utilization, (3) pre-and post-program questionnaires and interviews and (4) producing and distributing the fifteen content programs.

Indexes of the accumulated data base may also be used as a basis for manual retrospective searching. The manual search involves searching computer-prepared indexes from a machine readable data base produced largely by human abstracting and indexing. Retrospective searching in the Text-Pac System provides computer matching of a machine-readable data base prepared by human abstracting and indexing against questions manually prepared and translated into the system language. The entire record is scanned for occurrence of the question words and the &quot;hits&quot; from this matching are obtained in the form of a computer printout. The logic and search  strategy are the same as used for the Current Information Selection. (related reports are available as ED 044 120, and ED 044 121.) (Author/AB)",

The answer depends on what the user of the retrieval system wants, his wants being expressed in terms of stated precision-recall preference, or by the exact number of relevant documents he wishes to retrieve. Depth of indexing does not contribute significantly to effective retrieval. Documents should be indexed with broad terms to satisfy recall preferences with narrow terms to satisfy precision preferences since the amount of material retrieved in a system is not a simple function of the total numbers of terms posted to documents in the collection. At high cut-off values the retrieval power of broad and narrow terms tends  to become equalized. Precision can be improved through raising the cut-off point and deleting broad terms. Experiments with weighted indexing provided poor results, and with title-term indexing gave inconclusive results. (AB)",

The proposed system relates closely to the long range planning process since it enables each institution to estimate its requirements for future library resources and staffing once the factors of student enrollment, faculty staffing and graduate programs have been determined for any given year.

The method used to analyze trends in demand for future communications include: (1) assemble, from the literature and Stanford Research Institute (SRI) files, a list of existing or potential information transfer services; (2) select sample services from the list  that are of particular interest and (3) for each of the selected services, determine a projection variable that bares some relationship to the amount of information transferred. The major findings concern the maximum amount of electrical or electronic information transfer that might reasonably be expected in the categories of: voice; video; record, data, and private wire; and written.

Problems, objectives, and strategies for development of  activities are described and major problem areas within activities are delineated. Research which concentrates on disadvantaged populations, which is linked to other USOE programs, which can be disseminated to the schools, and which can be implemented in experimental schools or regional educational laboratories will offer maximal return for the investment of resources.

Near the end of the year, a 6-week training program consisting of 30-minute daily lessons using Piaget's tasks was administered to the experimental group by teacher aides. The controls were simultaneously given a traditional arithmetic program. The experimental program emphasized children's manipulation and classification of materials and the development of language and concepts of number, size, weight and length as well as an awareness of reversibility in relation to many different kinds of transformations. Both hypotheses were supported. (Author/AJ)",

These inferences may be summarized as follows: (1) The Bereiter-Englemann program has clearly had more impact on IQ and achievement than the traditional child-centered approach, but not necessarily more impact than other programs having a strong instructional emphasis; (2) the traditional nursery school and kindergarten program has failed to achieve as good results in cognitive learning as the more instructional approaches, and at the same time has not demonstrated any redeeming advantages; and (3) however encouraging the immediate results and follow-up achievement data of a preschool compensatory education program, no preschool program shows promise  of making, by itself, a permanent difference in poor children's scholastic success. It is suggested that no more resources be devoted to the search for better preschool programs because the existing technology enables young children to be taught far more than they can benefit from. It is proposed that educators direct more effort toward constructing articulated programs that permit teaching in preschool what will be useful later, and teaching in the elementary school what builds upon the child's learning in preschool.

Findings from the survey provide data on existing day care programs, availability of day care services, and the nature and extent of the need for day care service. The results of the survey indicate that there is a sizeable potential demand among low to moderate income working mothers for better day care center capacity, that for school-age children there is little organized care or other supervised recreation to meet needs before and after school; and low to moderate income working mothers pay a nominal amount of less than $100 a year for in-home care, and $400 to $700 a year for  out-of-home care. Information was obtained from day care center operators on expenses and income, and parents were asked what they were willing to pay for adequate day care and what they could afford.

        "description":"This research was initiated to determine whether the extent of a white child's first-hand contacts with black peers would influence his attitudes toward blacks. The subjects, 49 white, middle to upper class kindergarten children, all from two-parent homes with mothers who did not work outside the home, were divided into three groups: (A) children with no association with black children, (B) children with interracial contacts in school only, and (C) children with interracial contacts both in school and residential environment. The test used was the Social Episodes Test designed by Trager and Radke-Yarrow, but with pictures designed especially for this project. The three pictures shown and discussed were: (1) three white children playing and a black child approaching the group, (2)  three white children playing, and (3) three white children and one black child playing together. An interview was conducted to determine the extent of the child's associations with and feelings toward black children. 79.7% of the sample displayed some form of tension after being shown the first picture. About half that number of children displayed tension after picture number three of racial harmony. Refusal to discuss picture number one was most prevalent among Group B subjects. Tension displayed by distraction was most evident among Group A subjects. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"This study tests the hypothesis that labeling facilitates recall in nursery school children if and only if it leads to rehearsal. Subjects were 34 children ranging in age from 47 to 53 months. During pretraining, those children in the Label group named pictures of animals and fruits as they were presented, while those in the No Label group matched each picture to the same card in a second set of pictures. Eight test trials followed. During each one the child was shown two pictures, one at a time, with exposure ended as soon as he named them (or in the No Label group, after a comparably brief exposure.) For all subjects there was a 20-second delay between presentation and recall, during which the tester conversed with the child to prevent rehearsal. Subjects who labeled showed  recall superior to that of subjects who did not, indicating that the facilitating effect of labels in short-term memory is not solely attributable either to an increased tendency to rehearse or to the strengthening of a primary memory source.

Demographic data are included for the participating families, who are members of the Wolof in Senegal, Africa. For this study, interaction was defined as a sequence of behaviors involving both caretaker and infant which fell (a) within one 10-second time column or (b) extended over two or more time columns but which the observed judged to be a continuous sequence. Six different infant behaviors (fret/cry, extreme movement, look, vocalize, smile, touch) and five adult behaviors (touch-gross, touch-fine, vocalize, smile, approach) were recorded. After collecting the observational data, the new Bayley Scales of Infant Development were  given to the infants in their homes. The most important result to emerge was that the pattern of caretaker-infant interaction was related more strongly to the age of the infant than to any other variable investigated. The results of the developmental testing are in agreement with other findings that African infants show precocious development within the first year. No relationship between the interaction measures and tests of cognitive and motor skills was found. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"This study was designed to investigate the functional similarity of the mental processes children use to learn verbal tasks and pictorial tasks. Children in grades 3 and 6 (n=144) and in grade 9 (n=112) were given four short paired-associate tasks entitled Pictures, Concrete Words, Abstract Words, and Japanese Characters. The tasks consisted of six stimulus-response pairs presented over two trials. Planned comparisons in mean level of performance involved the first three tasks. Performance on Pictures was found to be superior to Concrete Words, and Concrete Words was superior to Abstract Words, with the former effect reaching significance for grades 3 and 9 and the latter for grades 3 and 6. An analysis of all four tasks found that correlation between Pictures and Concrete Words  increased across grade levels to a greater degree than correlation between any other pair of tasks. This last result paralleled data from an auxillary experiment and suggests a developmental increase in children's use of verbal processes along with imagery to learn pictorial materials.

Included are lengthy extracts from the discussion. Participants at the conference were from the biologic and social sciences. The goal of the conference was not so much to reveal answers to problems as to make sure the right questions were being asked, in the hope that the ultimate answers might serve as guides to social and political action. The seven parts into which the conference was divided emphasized these aspects of human development: earliest influences; physical and chemical growth and development; socialization in early childhood; cognition and learning; adolescence; the city; institutions, economics and the law. All of the papers are  timely; some were freshly updated before this publication. The issues discussed present the need for study and research, and for community action that will help children to live creative and productive lives. (Author/NH)",

The test meets the need for a brief procedure which (1) identifies articulation and language disorders, (2) is not dialect bound and goes across cultural and regional differences in English, and (3) is standardized on a predominately black population. The test takes 5 to 8 minutes to administer and includes basic areas of vocabulary, articulation, and language. A failure in articulation and/or language indicates the need for a longer evaluation. The results of the short screening test are compared with the results of more extensive testing for 152 children enrolled in day care and Head Start type programs.  Ages ranged from 2 1/2 to 5 1/2 years, with 25 children in each 6 month age group. Ninety-four percent of the time the screening either agreed with the evaluation (135 children) or gave a false positive (10 children), indicating that this test is an efficient and valid indicator of articulation and language disorders. Communication of results to school personnel and parents for effective follow up is discussed. Tables are included. A testing kit and manual are available. (Author/NH)",

Thirty infants, representing a random sampling of race, sex, and socioeconomic background, were tested on three consecutive days at ages 3 months, 5 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Tests based on existing methods of successful infant conditioning were adapted to infants' abilities at each age, but at each test time included eye blink, vocalization, head turn, discrimination and single-stimulus conditioning. Tests of attention-span and the Bayley Test of Mental and Motor Development were also given each time. The subjects will be tested again at age 3 and at age 7, using standard IQ and personality  tests. The feasibility of this longitudinal study was established, and conclusions were drawn about the usefulness of the various conditioning procedures employed. Further research leading to standardized procedures and a test of conditionability is needed, to give clues to the child's individual learning style. Figures showing the apparatus for the tests used in this study are included. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"The West 80th Street Day Care Center represents a community effort to meet the needs of the children and parents in the New York ghetto area it serves. The heart of the program and a major reason for its success is the fact that the center is community-controlled, with an unusually high degree of parent involvement. To help improve the lives of whole families, not just the children in the day care program, the center is very involved in social action programs, counseling and referrals, offers help to older children, and acts in special emergency situations. The educational program is based on the premise that a child's education cannot be isolated from the social system in which it takes place. The children are taught about the dangers of drugs on the streets, and in all  educational activities (which include many field trips) the center tries to link what the children see in the classroom with what they experience daily in the community. A special emphasis is placed on development of language skills and a good self image. In this report, background information is given on the center, and also details of program organization, staffing, and budget. Physical facilities are very poor (the center is located in an old restaurant), but through community efforts money has been raised for a new building. (NH)",

The ethnic distribution is wide including Chicano, Black, Anglo, Navajo and Chinese children. Significant to the program's success are: the complementary mix of staff personalities, the emphasis on career development of paraprofessionals, the extensive parental involvement, cross-cultural education, health care and social service resources. The educational program emphasizes that as a child gains confidence and masters skills, he develops socially and emotionally. Teachers plan units around various subjects and organize field trips and activities to accompany them. Children are encouraged to be aware of and express their feelings through dramatic  play, nursery rhymes and games. Praise is frequently given to build confidence and bolster self-images. Activities are structured around language growth, teaching of pre-reading skills, &quot;Sesame Street,&quot; music and art. Other information provided in this document includes discussion of center and staff organization and resource uses, samples of classroom schedules and learning games, and copies of a volunteer orientation schedule, and center regulations.

It is in an urban area, and over one-half of the families served are Puerto Rican, many of whom have unemployment and language barrier problems. A bilingual program (English-Spanish) is one of the outstanding features of the day care center. The program strongly emphasizes the development of English language skills, in an atmosphere which accepts the child's difficulty with English and reinforces his attempts to learn. Each age-grouped classroom has both English- and Spanish-speaking teachers who work for the development of positive self-images in the children and for the acquiring of language skills through a flexible curriculum. Development Learning materials are used  extensively for seriation and sensorimotor development. Counseling is available to parents at the center, with referrals to community social services if further help is needed.

A community organization program was also formed by the NRO system. Ninety percent of the families served are Chicano, and all are below the poverty level. These aspects of the day care program are particularly noteworthy: the trailer facilities (formerly used as mobile units, now permanently located); the educational program for children from 1 month through 5 years of age, which is based on the special needs of migrant children and uses a combination of approaches to adequately prepare the children for public school; and teacher training which insures that new curriculum is introduced efficiently and  uniformly throughout the NRO system.

More than 1,100 children are presently being served. There are eight centers and about 180 day homes which are used to supplement the care available at the centers, either because no center exists in the neighborhood or because it is felt the home environment would be more suited to a particular child. Other outstanding aspects of the NCDCA program are its stability over many years of operation, the job security it provides for staff, and its capacity for delivering social services through counseling and referrals. Creativity and independence are important to the NCDCA education program,  and a high value is placed by teachers and parents on manners and an ordered routine. Development programs in the day homes are somewhat limited because of lack of training of the day home operators, but warm and continuing care is provided. The organization, staff and budget of the NCDCA is described. An appendix gives additional illustrative materials. (NH)",

        "description":"The Mecklenburg County Department of Social Services in Charlotte, North Carolina, operates nine child development day care centers and 5 day homes which provide care for 257 Black and Anglo children, 2- to 5-years-old, primarily from low-income homes. The centers are located in churches, schools, and facilities in low income housing projects. The system's basic emphasis is to teach \"culturally isolated\" children to function in an integrated world using a variety of ethnic materials. Emphasis is placed on language development, motor and coordination skills, creative expression, and social-emotional development. Unique to the centers' program is the style and scope of the nutrition program. Many children suffer from malnutrition, anemia, and psychological anxieties resulting from  chronic hunger at home. Double amounts of food are served on Mondays when children are hungry from the weekend and on Fridays in anticipation of the weekend. Mealtime becomes a period for learning socialization. Another significant aspect of the program is the private home after-school care facilities that provide relaxed, yet stimulating, atmospheres for children after the regimented public school day. Although program data varies from center to center, general topics discussed in this report include parental involvement, transportation, health programs, staff training, center organization, and resource uses.

The centers,located in churches, abandoned school houses and store fronts are staffed largely by paraprofessionals from the community. Social services are extended beyond the child to the family. For instance, a homemaker service is offered the mothers during which the homemaker visits parents and offers to help in cooking, cleaning, or caring for a disabled parent. The homemaker often stimulates parents' interest in their children and helps families to help themselves. Parents are involved in all levels of the project's policymaking apparatus and active in all aspects of the  program. The training of paraprofessionals helps them to develop a wide variety of job skills. Volunteers are used extensively in many capacities. The children's education program is not formal and written curriculum is avoided. Emphasis is placed on individual expression through the use of creative materials. Nutrition and health are emphasized and providing transportation for children over the mountain roads is a continuing concern. Information is given on the centers' organization and use of resources.

Tables provide basic data on these centers and include information on background; notable elements; child, staff and family characteristics; and estimations of funding and expenditures for 1970-1971. Chapter Two discusses factors involved in the effective operation of a center and presents detailed recommendations. Designs are presented for three prototype centers serving  respectively 25, 50 and 75 children in average daily attendance. These designs detail center organization, staffing, operation, and finance. Chapter Three gives specific information about the provision of services beyond a core program for preschoolers. Both operations and finances are discussed.

Of concern is the need for development of a multilingual, cross-cultural approach to teaching in a curriculum which is sensitive to cultural diversity. Efforts of the Office of Education (OE) to aid the educationally disadvantaged through compensatory programs and Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act are examined, and a strategy is proposed concerning the most effective use of OE resources in pursuit of quality education and involvement of Indians in their educational programs. To intensify the assistance to the  Indians in their educational endeavors, the following are discussed: (1) the Higher Education Opportunity Act, (2) the Emergency School Assistance and Quality Integrated Education Act, (3) the National Institute of Education, and (4) the Education Revenue Sharing bill. In conclusion, the commissioner suggests a new commitment to a new Indian education policy which would provide Indians with a more equal educational opportunity. (EL)",

A morphology of educational change, implications for the Mexican American, and research notes are developed. It is concluded that education is the most important area of action for the Mexican American. The main issues in relation to the school are curriculum content, distribution of educational services, and control through school-community interest and participation. Demands to be made of the public school are (1) establishment of an open enrollment policy with transportation to make it a reality; (2) insisting that all teachers in predominantly or de facto segregated  Mexican American schools be bilingual in Spanish-English; (3) establishment of an adequate bilingual counseling service; (4) elimination of tracking; (5) improved libraries, facilities, and curriculum; (6) recruitment and promotion of Mexican American personnel on merit basis; (7) adequate programs of English as a second language; (8) meaningful adult educational, vocational, and recreational programs; (9) adequate placement services for graduates; and (10) development of Mexican American studies. Eight demands to be made to higher education are also listed. It is through such demands and implementations that the Mexican American may change his position in society or change the society itself.

However, more Spanish-surnamed young adults are enrolled in post high school programs, such as the Albuquerque Technical-Vocational Institute, than are students with other surnames.

The philosophy of early school camps was almost totally activity-centered, with little emphasis on formal curricular subject matter, such as science and math, except where needed to solve problems at hand; however, modern philosophy of school camps emphasizes those activities not normally undertaken in the classroom as well as school subject organization wherein different subject matter areas are dealt with specifically. Since many school districts do not own their own camp sites, a potential method of acquisition of facilities is rental from some other organization or  governmental agency. The major justification schools have for offering school camp programs is that these programs offer the potential for experiences unavailable in the classroom. (DA)",

        "description":"The report encompasses a joint student-faculty 2-year project (funded under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) conducted in an effort to decrease problems of the educationally handicapped students coming to Bacone College. In better preparing the student with low ACT scores for college level work, specialized or modified courses were offered in freshman English and mathematics as well as in core courses. In furthering the college program to relate to the unique student body that consisted of Negro, Caucasian, and American Indian students, a \"philosophical core theme\" concept of class organization was implemented. Units within the core concept included Discovering Who I Am, I Participate in Society, Understanding Myself, Math-Science for Me, My Right to Read,  Personality Through Speech, I Compete with Myself, Developing My Language Tools, and Writing for My Now and My Future. Descriptions of these units, projections for continued development of Bacone's program, and comments by former Bacone Students are presented in the Document, as well as results of a follow-up study of 51 Bacone students who transferred to Northeastern State College. As a result of the follow-up, conducted to determine whether grades earned at Bacone could be used to indicate a student's ability to do college work elsewhere, it is believed that students from Bacone can do college work in other institutions.

The field work, completed in 1967, was designed to (1) compile financial information to correlate with measures of output, (2) identify and determine reasons for differences in unit costs between geographical areas and accounting periods, (3) assess reliability of the BIA's financial records, and (4) appraise the effectiveness of the BIA's financial information in meeting management needs. Available information used included the fiscal years 1960 through 1965. The review principally focused upon effectiveness of the financial information system, feeding costs,  guidance and dormitory operation costs, school bus and biannual transportation costs, plant operations and maintenance costs, and laundry expenses incurred by BIA schools. Also reviewed were assistance to Indian pupils in non-Federal schools; school management, instruction, and program direction; and summer programs and adult education programs. Recommendations for improvement in financial management by the BIA are included in the report, as well as 22 trend charts and schedules with narrative designed to focus on principal results of the review.

Utilizing a control group of 100 students selected on the basis of sex, parent occupation, geographical location of home, and race (Indian or Anglo)--all of which corresponded with the dropout group--it was established through interview that poverty and the accompanying cultural traits contributed most heavily to a student's dropping out. The poverty group&quot; was characterized by (1) hostility toward the community and its power structure, (2) dependency upon welfare, and (3) &quot;today&quot; being the only  real entity in time. The non-poverty group showed the attitudes of rejection as well as paternalism toward the poverty group. Lack of leadership ability and lack of participation in extracurricular activities, negative or non-caring attitudes by parents, lack of academic achievement, and lack of periodicals in the home all correlated positively to dropouts. This study also pointed out that Indian dropouts may be running from cultural conflict in the society, in instructional assumptions, and in value judgments of the school. An appendix showing the age at withdrawal (by month) and age-sex distribution of the populations in 10 district towns is included, along with survey instruments and a bibliography. (MJB)",

The field staff provided referral services to over 1,000 migrant families and provided part-time personnel services during periods of peak loads in many counties in order to expedite supportive services. Over 20,000 emergency food stamp and surplus food certificates were issued to migrant families by the Department of Social Welfare. Although production of fruit crops and employment of seasonal agricultural workers declined during 1970, Farm Labor and Rural Manpower Service personnel made 65,418 referrals which resulted in 51,236 placements. The average earnings of  hourly-rated workers increased, while the average earnings of piece-rated workers decreased. Participating in the final year of the Texas Migrant Experimental and Demonstration Project, the emphasis for 1970 was aimed at supplying job counseling, job training, and employment services needed to assist participating migrant families in facilitating their transition from seasonal farm employment to other careers which provide permanent employment and higher incomes. Twelve project families desired to quit the migrant stream in 1970 and settle in Michigan. A related document is ED 048 968. (JH)",

Many residents were unprepared to compete in today's labor market. Of those with low income, 37% had no economic potential because of age (over 65) or disability and needed some form of income maintenance to alleviate poverty. Of those considered to have economic potential, 20% could expect to escape poverty through job retraining. If 2 or more members of a consumer unit (an individual or a family) were retrained, as many as 25% of the consumer units might escape poverty. Fewer than one-half of those potentially able to escape poverty were interested in retraining, which challenges retraining program administrators to develop  innovative training delivery systems. Very few respondents had potential for becoming successful farmers. (Author/LS)",

Rural households in the Coastal Plain of northeastern South Carolina were grouped into 5 mutually exclusive categories determined by the age, disability, and sex of the household head: (1) households with heads 65 years and older, (2) households with disabled heads less than 65 years old, (3) households with able-bodied male heads aged 45-64 years, (4) households with able-bodied male heads less than 45 years old, and (5) households with able-bodied female heads less than 65 years old. Resulting categories of the poor were examined to evaluate their needs and to determine their potential for income  improvement through self-help programs of public assistance. One-half of the poor households, containing two-thirds of all income-deprived youth in the study area, were headed by able-bodied, working males. Assistance programs designed to lessen the impact of poverty among rural youth must be oriented to this target group. Most heads, particularly the younger ones, were willing to train, change jobs, and move from the area, if necessary, to get better pay. The remaining productive years of this group warrant public investment to improve skills and other income-producing resources. (Author/LS)",

Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance F-test, with controlled variables being sex, place of residence (city, town, country-nonfarm, and farm), and residence on/not on the Mexican Border. Language usage as an indicator of ethnic identification was concluded to be invalid by this study, but \"the theoretical significance of this fact must  be explored.\" On the basis of this, the author discounted language usage as a criterion to judge an individual's success index, feeling and thinking index, and job performance index.

The activity was 1 of 7 coordinated inservice institutes conducted during 1970 for vocational education and related personnel from rural areas throughout the United States. Major problems with which the institute dealt related to transfer and utilization of information to bring about changes in instructional programs. Through use of various approaches, the steps in the educational change process were illustrated and  simulated during the workshop experience. Three small groups worked together to apply the concepts and approaches presented and developed by the consultants, interpreters, and participants.

To accomplish the purposes and objectives established, various activities were used to enrich the understandings and experiences of the participants. Activities included formal lectures, informal presentations, 2 symposia, discussion groups, a  demonstration meeting, and individual and small group assignments. Institute participants were made aware of the importance of providing supportive services to students, especially disadvantaged and handicapped students, and were provided with techniques for initiating or improving such programs. In addition, the institute resulted in 5 task-group reports on recommended strategies for improving the coordination of supportive services and the development of realistic plans of action. (JH)",

Incidence of poverty was greatest among the aged, disabled, and small farmers of all ages who made farming their major source of earnings. Of the respondent households in this 1967 survey, 87% had earnings. Most respondents were nonfarmers. Although 42% received some income from a farm, only 12% got the major portion of their earnings from this source. Some 72% of poor households with heads under age 45, and 57% of those with heads aged 45-64, reported no income other than earnings, interest, or dividends. Even more received no welfare payments. In this area, where two-fifths of all houses were built before 1901, substandard housing was  prevalent among the poor. In addition to the narrative portion of the text, a list of 23 references, an appendix of tables showing relative income deprivation criteria, a cross index of tables in this report with those in &quot;Rural Poverty in Three Southern Regions,&quot; and 16 other pertinent tables are included.

Program components included a kindergarten course designed to teach Spanish-speaking students to read Spanish, a 2-year sequence of oral English instruction (kindergarten and grade 1) coupled with a 2-year experimental English reading program (grades 1 and 2), and a 2-year program in English and Spanish designed to teach 1st and 2nd graders about their families, culture, and school. The program, serving 1,210 students from 5 public and 2 parochial schools, had as its specific  objectives (1) to field-test and revise the first-year Spanish reading program, (2) to field-test and revise the English as a second language program, (3) to develop and pilot-test a first-year transitional English reading program, and (4) to develop and pilot-test a first-year social education program.

Data collection was accomplished using personal interviews, classroom and playground observations, sociograms, standardized tests, and informal conversation. In addition, 71 student case studies from the 1963 sample and 42 student case studies from the 1968 sample were used to supplement information obtained from 15 members of the dormitory staff, 2  school board members, 10 administrators, 54 teachers, 21 Anglo students, and the parents or relatives of 26 Navajo children.

The program thrust is beginning to become apparent in 1970. Local educators need to take into strict account the fact that education can no longer do the job alone. Educators must use other social agencies and must refine a partnership with the private sector to provide youngsters with realistic educational opportunities. This will be difficult in regions of the South where strong political influence has always pervaded education. As education must broaden its base and develop sources of support in other sectors of the community, it will erode the power base of the school superintendent and his traditional hold over decisions in education.  Educators must develop innovative approaches to utilization of the total resource allocation available to them; the classroom must expand into the community. School experiences must relate to real things, and the spirit of discovery must be tied to an analysis of society's needs. Education programs for the 70's will be designed to provide better-trained teachers, new program thrusts, and innovative structures so that education may continue to develop. (LS)",

(3) The fourth graders had almost reached the preference position of the adults. (4) Half of the second graders were approaching the adult pattern of preference. (5) Poor readers in third and fourth grades were less consistent than better readers in preference choices;  they also tended to take a more letter dominated view of similarity. (6) College seniors preferred the second error-word significantly more often than did the elementary children.

(5) The teacher must be concerned that the demands he puts on his students are realistic.

In the last decade there has been a move toward the knocking down of physical walls within the school (nongrading, team teaching, and individualized instruction), but first the psychological walls within the curriculum should be knocked down. This curriculum change may be accomplished by (1) extending elements of the informal kindergarten to the years beyond so that a proper balance is struck between learning on one's own and learning in groups; (2) integrating language arts programs to include writing, reading, content reading, and oral skills; (3) teaching grammar incidentally in connection with the others; (4) using a basal  program selectively and applying new technology; and (5) using books written by the children. Encouraging children to select what is to be published or discarded will help to develop criteria of excellence and improve their insight and taste as well as writing. Thus the major components of a language arts program are the children, the teacher, and books. (AW)",

There are three basic shortcomings in professional preparation today: (1) leaders and experts are inadequate; (2) course work for certification is not the crucial key to good reading teachers; and (3) too much blind devotion is placed in each approach to reading, and each of these methods has its shortcomings. The decoding approaches neglect important aspects of beginning reading instruction, such as readiness and listening experiences; the eclectic approach fails because teachers themselves are not eclectic; the language-experience approach demands creative, imaginative teachers, which 90 percent of the teachers are not; finally, the esoteric  methods often fail because they are used with insufficient diagnosis and without strict adherence to the manual. To overcome these failures in reading instruction, more attention must be given to readiness of individual students. Reading instruction could also benefit by looking at \"nonprofessional\" reading methods that have proven successful. In addition, both reading methods instructors and reading teachers should understand and practice the basic rules for success in reading. Finally, reading teachers must teach aggressively, think positively, and work at the task of teaching. (VJ)",

Thirty-five undergraduates were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (18 to individual symbol method of presentation and 17 to the embedded symbol whole word method). For the first group, 17 TWS graphemes were paired with corresponding TO graphemes in the Roman alphabet for learning; for the second group, the symbols were arranged to spell nine words. In a transfer test the subjects were required to transliterate seven novel words into their TO equivalents. The number of trials to  reach criterion (one errorless trial) for both methods was analyzed by means of ANOVA, and the Mann-Whitney U Test was used to analyze the data from the transfer task. Results showed that instruction by the whole word method resulted in faster learning, but this mastery was not as conducive to transfer as learning the symbols individually. When learning and transliteration were considered together, the individual letter method of instruction was significantly faster than the whole word method. It was concluded that though slower in initial learning, the individual letter method was superior and faster for transfer performance and overall time. Tables and references are included. (AW)",

For example, total group reading allows for presentation of specific ideas or skills which students can share after reading and for full enjoyment and sharing of some types of literature, such as drama and poetry. Smaller groups can be used for developing sequential skills, with several students who are at approximately the same level helping each other. Small groups are also useful for students interested in the same topic or striving toward the same goal, whether the  content be academic or nonacademic. Individual procedures are best for developing some skills, such as personal reading for pleasure, relaxation, or specific information. There are also various instructional skills packages designed to be used individually. Each of these approaches has its place in the classroom and can be used in all content areas.

        "description":"Because televisions are found in many homes today, they can be used as a channel for bringing reading improvement courses to a large number of people. Various experimental television reading programs are summarized which have proven successful in motivating people to improve their reading skills. Through Glendale Community College in Arizona, a weekly 28-minute reading improvement course was offered over commercial television. Enrolled students came on campus for administration of the Iowa Silent Reading Test prior to the first session of the course. Test results, along with reading materials kits with practice exercises, were mailed to each student. Each weekly lesson consisted of three parts: class instruction, including a review of the preceding lesson; guests; and the use of  filmstrips with the Tach X. It was found that careful planning of each lesson was needed to make the best use of the limited time schedule. Many typical classroom materials were used successfully on the programs, such as films and the overhead projector. At the end of the course, the Iowa Silent Reading Test was again administered on campus. Comparison of the pretest and post-test results indicated that students became involved in their work and improved their reading techniques. References are included. (VJ)",

Chapter 1 provides the groundwork for a sequential skills reading program, dealing with materials, diagnosis of students' reading abilities, grouping, and procedures. The three chapters which follow recommend different, but complementary, approaches to teaching reading. The oral approach section includes articles for background information, a bibliography of selections for reading to students, and bibliographies of taped stories from state-adopted texts. The chapter on developing individualized reading programs includes suggestions for motivating student interest in stories; a bibliography of high interest, easy reading books; and recommendations for  grouping. Suggestions for the humanities approach to enhance reading include enumeration of various themes treated in state-adopted texts, including specific behavioral objectives and lesson plans for examining these themes. The final chapter of the guide is concerned with techniques for evaluating the reading program. Also included is a bibliography of professional works on reading and teaching methods. (VJ)",

The IPI model includes four components: analysis of subject matter content, diagnosis of student preinstructional behavior, sequencing of materials to facilitate learning, and evaluation strategies. Elementary students in two experimental schools (E1, E2) and two control schools (C1, C2) were administered the vocabulary and the reading comprehension tests of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills at the end of the treatment period. Comparison between the mean grade equivalent scores of E1 and C1 showed that IPI pupils scored equal to or higher than non-IPI pupils in half the cases. Comparison between E2 and C2 showed that while neither group earned the  minimum test norm, all IPI pupils had scores equal to or higher than non-IPI pupils. In addition, pupil attitudes toward school and self were more positive in IPI pupils than in their counterparts. It was concluded that IPI does work in the area of decoding and of reading/study skills, and it has produced effective results with a variety of populations. Tables and references are included.

Results showed that (1) teachers showed significant gains in making informed decisions on a paper and pencil  exercise, (2) there was evidence of informed decision-making in the actual classroom situation, and (3) although the cognitive knowledge of the teachers did not increase significantly, there were indications of some cognitive gain from chi-square frequencies movement upwards in the quarter categories of the 2 by 2 array of data.

Second, a careful examination of the instruments used in perceptual training investigations would be a useful guide to selection of classroom tests. In addition, standardized testing should be supplemented with systematic informal observation, and clues to effective instruction should be searched for in well-controlled research. Third, teachers  should support good programs of motor development which foster the general well-being of students even though direct correlation to reading is inconclusive.

There is no doubt as to the validity of these new technologies on an experimental basis. Much good is found in the motivational and instructional aspects of machine instruction; but too much reliance on machines may reduce creativity and limit the amount of information and growth potential to a learner and at the same time result in the danger of dehumanizing learning and students. Machines currently available are (1) tachistoscopic machines providing practice and reinforcement in skill mastery and rate increase; (2) recordings and films providing reinforcement, instruction, and other  guidance; and (3) other audiovisual devices providing different levels of instruction ranging from simple presentation to that which demands a response from the student. Because of financial limitations, instead of buying one of every kind of machine, schools should carefully assess their needs and purchase the most useful items, such that enough of these could be used for all classrooms. Inservice teacher training programs should emphasize the application of technology in the classroom to encourage teachers to use these machines. (AW)",

Regression analysis was used to assess the degree of additional information the de Hirsch tests added to the prediction of scores on the Gates-MacGinitie, beyond that provided by the Metropolitan. The alphabet subtest of the Metropolitan and the word reversals and word reproduction tests of the de Hirsch contributed the most to the prediction of  second-grade comprehension scores. Discriminate analysis showed that the Metropolitan Test used alone properly classified 28 of 29 poor readers and 68 of 79 superior readers, and that the alphabet subtest discriminated nearly as well as all six Metropolitan subtests.

Much training was carried out in the observation and analysis of children's reading performance. Teachers were also trained to administer and analyze reading tests and to examine their instructional reading materials. There were also discussions on student grouping  and classroom organization. This resulted in the emergence of eclectic programs in each room and a diversity of classroom management practices, as well as a piecemeal approach to planning. The persistent problems concerned substitute teachers--teachers reported dissatisfaction with their performance. Also, the workshop session was often preempted by other activities.

Orthography is especially important to reading when it emphasizes spelling. Psycholinguistics holds great potential for aiding the reading teacher, but until the psychologist and the linguist add the neurologist to their study, the help from psycholinguistics will be incomplete. Reading instruction  is also aided by lexicography and etymology; dictionary usage is a valuable word attack skill, and tracing word origins is a source of pleasure for some students.

        "description":"The development of a new scheme for classifying the more than 7,000 documents on reading in the ERIC/CRIER data collection is described. An original scheme, developed in the early days of the clearinghouse, provided a means for listing documents in any of 45 broad subject categories in the field of reading and for identification by grade level. The system was found to be inadequate in that it did not permit sufficient precision for effective retrieval. The newly developed classification scheme proposes 27 classes into which documents can be divided. Each of these uses a numerical schedule which includes subclasses and provides means of adding more as needed. Further classification by grade level, source of material, type of material, and date of publication is also provided  through a faceting technique. To facilitate use of the classification scheme, an index was developed which alphabetically lists terms included in the scheme. Testing of the scheme by ERIC/CRIER personnel was carried out on a 200-document sample, and comparisons were made of their notations. Overall agreement of better than a designated standard of 60 percent was determined for 77 percent of the documents, with higher agreement noted in individual parts of the notation. Illustrations of aspects of the scheme are included. (MS)",

In 1965-66, data were gathered from 49,752 students who took the CEEB Chemistry Achievement Test. Questionnaires from 2,395 of these students were studied primarily for (1) the types of chemistry courses offered, (2) textbooks used, (3) topics studied, (4) time allotted, and (5) other secondary school courses taken. Findings indicated that despite the many variables involved, the content of secondary school chemistry did not vary greatly. Five fundamental topics were consistently taught in nearly all of these chemistry courses. Results supported the concept of nationwide chemistry achievement tests.

        "description":"During the 1967-69 ninth grade students at the University of Chicago Laboratory School had the opportunity to schedule various activities during an optional session when they participated in part of an independent learning project. Staff of the project included teachers of English, mathematics, science, and social studies, two librarians, a counselor, and a research associate. Seventy-three variables concerned with pupil background, indicators of study and conceptual skills, divergent thinking abilities, student self report characteristics (giving scores for sociability, diligence, individualism, and internal or external control), academic interest, use of optional time and indicators of pupil independence were analyzed. \"Independence\" is now seen as a mixture of habits of  thought, ability, attitudes, and behavior characterizing a person willing and able to structure his own learning activities. For students initially independent, the program provided an opportunity for growth in self-reliant behavior; initially dependent students may not have benefited. Methods of differential treatment of these groups should be developed. Appendices include four papers on aspects of independent learning, copies of tests given students, and the means, standard deviations and intercorrelations for each variable studied. (AL)",
