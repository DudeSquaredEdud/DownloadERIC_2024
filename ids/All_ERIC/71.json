        "description":"Libraries serve our nation and its citizens in two primary ways: by preserving our common culture, and by nurturing and sustaining democracy itself. A particular democratic function of libraries is fostering reading. As noted in two reports recently issued by the U.S. Department of Education, \"What Works\" and \"First Lessons,\" it is imperative to develop our children's reading ability, and libraries are essential to achieving this goal. Libraries should not only preserve; they should promote learning and literature--librarians should be advocates as well as custodians. Moreover, the library is an essential part of the school and, as key members of a school's education team, librarians can contribute to the content of education by thinking carefully about the books they acquire for  the library and by making a judicious selection of the books they wish to promote. Although technological innovations have led to enormous changes in the operations of libraries, the preservation and nurture of our culture and our nation are still the functions of libraries. Good books and good librarians are indispensible to the attainment of this goal. (KM)",

To achieve this goal, DTIC is sponsoring the development of an integrated bibliographic information system (IBIS). The system prototype, which has been under development since April 1983, will be used to demonstrate the concept of an integrated library system combined with an intelligent gateway capable of simultaneously querying and updating more than one heterogeneous bibliographic database (catalog) using a common  command language. A discussion of the project includes the project background; DoD library environment; development approach; information processing concepts and technologies investigated and selected for implementation in the prototype system; and issues underpinning system implementation. Considerations for the future include devising an acquisition strategy, developing a standard or common set of index terms and controlled subject terms for shared cataloging and retrieval; developing a microcomputer-based version of the IBIS; and expanding the number of databases that can be accessed and queried using the common command language.

The development and current status of distance library services at the University of British Columbia (UBC), the University of Victoria (UVic), Simon Fraser University (SFU), and the Open Learning Institute (OLI) are described, and the common distance library service elements of the four institutions are compared, including core collections, special telephone lines, requests for specific material, reference queries, interlibrary loans, computer literature  searches, advertisement of services, bibliographic instruction, support staff, and charges for service. This comparison reveals that library services are an important component of university extension and distance education in British Columbia. The 31 replies received in a national survey of 42 university libraries, however, indicate that few libraries elsewhere in Canada employ a model of distance library service similar to the one used in British Columbia. It is noted that the growing body of literature on distance library services will help promote more awareness of these services and facilitate the development of a closer working relationship between distance education personnel and librarians.

Examples in the manual are taken from databases in the Bibliographic Retrieval Services (BRS) system and Datatimes. The rationale and objectives for instruction are presented; the ERIC, ABSTRAX (A400), and Datatimes databases are introduced; specific procedures for going online with BRS and Datatimes are detailed; and factors to be considered before going online are discussed. In addition, two sets of suggested search activities and complete sample searches on seven topics are included, and a 39-item  annotated bibliography on student searching is provided. Four appendices include examples of BRS logical operators; a listing of the names, labels, producers, and descriptions of databases available on BRS as of August 1985; a summary of BRS commands, logical operators, and print options; and 20 additional search strategies.

This compilation includes only the material that was distributed for public comment. It does not include the minutes of meetings of advisory groups formed during 1986 to study ERIC, the background papers that were prepared to stimulate internal discussion, or the many letter reactions that were received from the field in response to these public announcements. The components of this package are: (1) &quot;ERIC in Its Third Decade&quot; (a statement of  principles); (2) &quot;Domains or Scope Areas to Be Included in the ERIC System&quot;; and (3) &quot;Summary of the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) Redesign&quot; (an implementation paper). Appended to the third component are two position papers: (1) &quot;Access ERIC&quot; (including &quot;ERIC Partners&quot;), by John Collins; and (2) &quot;Adjunct Clearinghouses,&quot; by Elizabeth Payer. Except insofar as they may be modified by further public comment or congressional action, it is OERI's intent to proceed to modify ERIC along the lines described in these documents. These changes involve: (1) Merging the Clearinghouses on Teacher Education and Counseling and Personnel Services into a &quot;School Professionals&quot; Clearinghouse; (2) Changing the names of seven Clearinghouses; (3) adding a Clearinghouse on &quot;Education  Statistics,&quot; to be located within the Center for Education Statistics (CES); (4) Initiating a new ERIC system component called &quot;ACCESS ERIC&quot; to concentrate on marketing, promotion, advertising, public relations, training, system-wide information analysis products, and liaison with other information systems; (5) Initiating a formal users' group to be called &quot;ERIC Partners&quot;; (6) Initiating a new kind of &quot;Adjunct Clearinghouse&quot; that will, at no cost to ERIC, acquire and process for ERIC the educational literature in the distinctive areas (e.g., art) in which their host organizations may have a special interest.

During the year, the program had the following achievements: (1) linkages were established with the City University of New York (CUNY); (2) together with Baruch and Queens Colleges, LCC developed and implemented a joint admissions program; (3) contacts were initiated with State Univerity of New York campuses; (4) work with private colleges and universities led to various activities to help students develop a plan to pursue scholarships and private funding sources; (5) a second institute was held at Vassar College with 22 LCC students participating; (6) 57  juniors and seniors from six local high schools were selected to participate in the Credit Bank Program; (7) a Career Development Module was designed to introduce educational and career planning in the required Freshman Seminar; (8) a Transfer Seminar was designed to assist with educational planning, college selection, and the application process; (9) the counseling staff increased its responsibilities regarding transfer; (10) two College Transfer Fairs were held; and (11) a Transfer Information Guide was developed to provide complete information on how a particular curriculum transfers to a parallel program at a four-year college. The project report provides an overview of these accomplishments as well as a description of related support services, a summary of evaluation goals and  procedures, and budgetary information for the period studied. Five appendixes make up the bulk of the report.

Introductory material explains the purpose of the essays, describes the student population, and outlines the methods used to analyze the essays. Part I of the report uses quotations from the student essays to draw profiles of the following student types: self-discoverers, undecideds, innocents, immigrants, perseverers, devotees, non-comformists, self-worth seekers, the prideful, and believers. Part II presents six entire student essays, each  representing a different urban area. Part III offers observations on the data, including reasons for selecting community colleges as study sites and a summary profile of the students as typically optimistic, frequently naive, and almost always appreciative of the community college and its faculty. Discussed also are: the recurring theme in students' essays of military enlistment immediately after high school graduation by male siblings; the participation of community college English faculty in the essay project; and differences between suburban and urban participants.

Introductory remarks pointing to questions being raised concerning the decision-making authority and capacity of trustees are followed by a working definition of governance to be used as a basis for the assessment of current and future trustee roles. The next section examines trustee roles in governance, offering a model that contains two elements: the amount of time and attention trustees devote to strategic issues and the problem of dualism in governing community colleges. In addition, historical and current perspectives on trustee roles are provided.  Next, changing social conditions (e.g., deinstitutionalization of human services, centralization of state-level decision making, economic differentiation, and changing government spending priorities) are reviewed in terms of their effect on trustee roles in governance. After proposing an expanded trustee role in budgeting and planning, the monograph presents a chart outlining respective trustee and administrative roles in governance for 16 decision areas. Next, an in-service model for trustee development is presented, and information on the implementation of the model is provided. Finally, concluding comments summarize the components of the future roles of trustees. A \"working bibliography\" of 70 sources is appended. (LAL)",

Puente integrates the skills of an English teacher, a Hispanic counselor, and Hispanic professionals acting as mentors to promote academic achievement, self-confidence, and student motivation. A study was conducted at Evergreen Valley College (EVC) to determine the success rate of Puente students for the years 1983-84, 1984-85, and 1985-86; and to compare the achievement levels of Puente students enrolled in the entry level English 330 courses with those of other Hispanic students who began in English 330 during the same semester. The 3-year comparative study of 115 Puente students  and 273 Hispanic counterparts yielded the following findings: (1) 89% of the Puente students completed English 330 compared to 46% of the other Hispanic students; (2) 70% of the Puente students completed English 1A, compared to 8% of the other Hispanic students; (3) Puente students completed English 1B at a rate 14 times higher than their counterparts; (4) Puente students were three times as likely to remain enrolled at EVC (53% vs. 17%); (5) all 21 of the Hispanic students who began English 330 in fall 1983 and 1984 and who had received or applied for an associate degree by fall 1985 were enrolled in the Puente Project; and (6) all 14 of the students from the original group who transferred to a four-year college were Puente students. The study report includes information on the goals and  methods of the Puente Project, along with 25 tables detailing comparative findings. Appendixes include a list of Puente projects statewide, a fact sheet on the mentor role, a list of EVC mentors, a list of advisory board members, and an outline of course criteria. (Author/LAL)",

The next sections outline problems associated with such programs, focusing on administrative concerns, which are primarily related to defining the \"mission\" or goal of the center, and providing financial support for the center's activities; problems with recruiting and screening faculty tutors; difficulties associated with tutor training; scheduling conflicts; and problems with unsatisfactory tutor performance and accountability.

Faced with divergent functions and financial/staffing constraints, two-year college development officers must not only serve as efficient managers, but also as effective leaders who can motivate other college personnel to support the resource development function. Resource development areas which require effective leadership include the following: (1) the provision of guidance to faculty and other staff in proposal development and other fund-raising strategies; (2) the establishment of practical goals and objectives for the resource development  effort; (3) the appropriate use of consultants to save time and money, to make necessary contacts, and to lend credibility to a fund-raising effort; and (4) the development of communications processes to inform staff and faculty about grants and fund-raising projects and get them involved in proposal development and other efforts. The special constraints of fund raising at the two-year college level must be considered for effective leadership efforts to be undertaken. At the same time, it is also important to note the advantages involved, such as two-year institutions' openness to innovation and the development officer's ability to serve as a change agent within the institution.

Study findings, based on responses from 113 colleges, included the following: (1) 88% of the colleges  reported that some percentage of the total campus acreage could be made available for various non-educational purposes; (2) the respondents reported that 8,133 acres (52% of the total acreage reported) was dedicated directly to the educational programs; (3) 53% of the institutions reported that all or portions of land available for various uses was used for aesthetic purposes only; (4) the 1986 survey found nearly twice as much acreage (1,214 acres) committed to public use as the 1978 survey; (5) nature trails and recreation areas were the most frequently reported public uses; (6) the total of the maintenance cost estimates reported was $1,260,188 for the maintenance of a combined total of 940 acres (or an average cost of $1,340.62 per acre); (7) 28 institutions dedicated 1,214 acres to  income purposes, with the predominant pattern being for an institution to lease land for agricultural purposes; and (8) only 18 respondents to the 1986 survey and 15 respondents to the earlier survey had a formal land use policy. Case studies focusing on land use income and programming, ways of overcoming lack of funds, and an endowment for the perpetual care of the Wilkes Community College (North Carolina) campus are included in the study report, along with state- and institutional-level recommendations.

Each chapter of the report states a premise, examines data and trends supporting that premise, and considers implications for community colleges. Chapter 1 focuses on anticipated changes in the demographics and lifestyle of Californians. Chapter 2 concentrates on issues  related to societal complexity and changing social values, changing skill requirements and skills obsolescence, and demands for increased productivity. After chapter 3 considers the variations among California communities, chapter 4 looks at the effects of the information and technology revolution on education and learners. Chapter 5 examines the question of educational quality in the context of change, and chapter 6 addresses institutional renewal as an essential response to rapid change. Finally, chapter 7 tries to project the future course of the state's economy and to examine its impact on the funding of community colleges.

The project was a joint effort by the Texas Department of Human Services (DHS) Region 11 child protective services programs from Harris and Montgomery counties and the DePelchin Children's Center in Houston. Intervention focused on helping families learn new ways to solve typical family problems. Parts I and II of the report provide, respectively, a process description and an impact evaluation of project outcomes for the period between September, 1984, and August, 1986. The process description focuses on the background and  origin of the project, first- and second-year operations and accomplishments, issues, and problems. The impact evaluation of the project compares the intensive intervention provided by DHS with similar services provided by the private contractor, DePelchin Children's Center, and with standard DHS protective services. Results indicated that while costs of intensive services were higher than for DHS standard services, the lower rate of removals and recidivism in intensive services cases resulted in lower cost for foster care and additional casework. Cost differences between intensive intervention provided by DePelehin and DHS were negligible. Appendices provide case summaries and the screening and impact evaluation forms used in the project.

It is concluded that increased knowledge of parents' effects on children's development has revealed how much remains unknown. Progress has been made over the past decade, but the progress has been in problem finding rather than in problem solving, divergent rather than convergent. Researchers should focus on the limits of parents' effects on their children's development and conduct systematic  experiments.

In 1967, the most salient issues were the following: How important is early childhood for education? When should early education begin? Can early education compensate for childhood experiences at home? Are the effects of early education permanent? In 1972, the central issue was what kind of early educational program is best? By 1977, the most pressing issues had shifted to the following: How can early education be done most efficiently and cheaply? Is parent education the answer? How does parent education work? In 1982, a new issue had arisen: What are the effects of full-time day care  on preschool children's development? Today, the most pressing new issues seem to be: How can we maximize the fit between programs and participants? What are the implications of the superbaby trend? What are the effects of day care on infants' development? A plea is made for research studies to be conducted that will address these urgent issues. (Author/RH)",

More states had implemented the six provisions not requiring state legislation than the eight that do.

All states reporting such information expected enactment by October 1, 1987. Regarding the six provisions not  requiring legislation, all states reporting such information expected implementation by December 31, 1986. The most frequently cited reasons for implementation delays were (1) administrative procedures were not developed or in effect or, (2) regarding the annual notices provision, needed changes in the states' automated data processing systems had not been made.

The first year was devoted to designing, making, and refining instructional materials. During the second year, one Head Start and two kindergarten classes participated as experimental and control groups. In the third year, the number of Head Start and kindergarten experimental and control groups was increased. Experimental group classes experienced an initial instructional unit in which functions of various computer parts, games, songs, and activities were taught. Subsequently, both experimental and control classes used computers. Data  were collected on pre-tests and post-tests. Generally, results showed that the initial instructional unit helped the kindergarten experimental class children to remember the largest number of computer-related terms.

A survey was prepared to assess the relative effects of a $50, $100, or $200 per month bonus or a one-time $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000 bonus on the willingness of families to extend in USAREUR (United States Army--Europe) for 12 months). In addition, the incentive value of a space-required trip to point of embarkation or home of record, with 30 days noncharged leave, was assessed. The option of a different job was also offered as an incentive for a 12-month extension. The survey was administered in May 1983 to more than 1,000 Army families,  including both the service members and their spouses. Families were representative of service members in combat arms, combat support, and combat service support organizations which were distributed over large, medium, and small military communities. A representative distribution of married and accompanied families in each rank grade was obtained. Findings indicated that service members were distributed in three groups: those who would extend without incentive, those who might extend with incentive, and those who would not extend for any inducement. Findings are intended for use by Army planners to determine the most cost-effective incentives for a desired extension rate. Data for enlistees, noncommissioned officers, and officers are presented separately. (RH)",

Subjects were 16 infants with normal Apgar scores at birth who were volunteered by their parents after an initial contact in a maternity hospital. Strangers' faces were closely matched to mothers' hair color, hair length, and facial complexion. It was predicted that, in the en face condition, a visual preference for the mother's face would be found. In the half-profile condition, it was again predicted that the mother's face would be preferred. In the full profile condition, it was predicted that no preference would be evident. Findings revealed that the en face and  half-profile poses resulted in significant visual preferences for the mother. No preference for mother was evident in the profile pose condition.

Alcohol consumption was estimated by self-report questionnaires filled out by mothers who were over 30 years of age. The questionnaire elicited information about the amount of alcohol mothers consumed prior to, during, and following pregnancy. Alcohol level was then computed using the Jessor, Graves, Hanson and Jessor AA score. The attachment behavior of 46 infants was observed at one year of age using the Ainsworth Strange-Situation Procedure. Infants were classified as: secure; insecure-avoidant; or insecure-ambivalent/resistent. Additionally, a new classification of insecure-disorganized/disoriented was used. This classification is thought to  include infants who may have very serious attachment disturbances. Findings indicated that the majority of infants of mothers who consumed more alcohol prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy were insecure in comparison to a minority of insecure infants of mothers who were abstinent or light drinkers during those time periods. Other results indicated that the classification of infants as insecure-disorganized/disoriented helped to identify a large number of infants who were insecure in the group of heavy drinking mothers. A 34-item reference list is appended. (Author/RH)",

The strategy of the design was to apply the same treatment in sequence across matched subjects exposed to identical environmental conditions. Subjects were selected by matching age, intelligence quotient, ethnic background, and economic status. Six additional children served as playmates for baseline and treatment activities. In the baseline condition, subjects were observed while involved in unstructured play. In the treatment condition, sociodramatic play was enriched through (1) theme-related activities; (2) increased  time, space, and props; or (3) facilitation of play. A total of 48 15-minute samples of the three subjects' language during play were audiotaped. Audiotapes were analyzed for vocabulary words specific to the defined theme of play; thought unit length and development (in T-units); total words; words specifying concepts of color, shape, number, quantity, space, and time; and language functions. Findings indicated that a functional relationship exists between sociodramatic play and language performance. (RH)",

This summary report and statement of conclusions provides views on (1) meeting the needs of young children; (2) parental roles; (3) the professional's role; and (4) changes in policy. The discussion of children's needs focuses on parents as resources for learning, family school partnership, pressures on the family, and formal versus non-formal models of intervention. The discussion of parental roles takes up the issues of cost-effectiveness of parent-based programs and social influences on program effectiveness. Quality in programs, institutionalization, and professional/parent collaboration are topics discussed in the overview of the professional's  role. The discussion of policy issues includes views concerning child advocacy and evaluation as a formative tool. It is concluded that a good curriculum in childhood education should be based on and positively reinforce the child's own family and environment, while remaining sensitive to the need of the child to move on to other environments. The key issues are the child's stable socialization, the development of the capacity to cope with school as an institution, and the ability to actively exploit opportunities. (RH)",

Chapter 1 reviews educational criticism since the 1950s. Chapter 2 contrasts two high schools--one traditional, one nontraditional--in one community, focusing on the influence of school size and school culture. Chapter 3 outlines the benefits of small high schools for students and teachers. Chapter 4 discusses strategies for change at the technical, managerial, and cultural levels, noting that change at the  cultural level is the most difficult to achieve and has the greatest effect. Chapter 6 describes &quot;Mountain Open&quot; High School, a model small high school program in Colorado. Topics include educational philosophy, individualized learning, student characteristics, teaching conditions, and curriculum. Discussion of curriculum covers the use of trips, community learning, community service, and the Walkabout--the culminating project in which students prove they can use their skills in real-world settings. Chapter 7 presents change strategies, emphasizing the need to address the problems of school size, structure, and culture. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Distance education is a current &quot;catch-all&quot; phrase for any form of instruction in which the learner is linked to an educational institution and is formally enrolled, but instruction does not necessarily have to be delivered to or from an official school site. Distance education can provide equity and increase the quality of educational opportunity; it can also provide access to subject matter not available in the local community, interaction and joint activities with students in other schools, increased access to information/instructional resources, opportunities for staff development and inservice training, and increased school/community linkages. Examples of rural distance education projects in K-12 settings in various states and localities are: elective correspondence classes  which can be taken for high school credit; courses in writing fiction using electronic mail; astronomy and calculus courses using audiographic resource development for vocational agriculture using telecommunications; and an electronics course using slow scan television and audiographics. Four examples of whole course delivery using satellite transmission are described, as are two examples of statewide distance educational networks. Most current K-12 distance education programs provide elective and enrichment courses or experiences supplementing the core curriculum. Such programs often have unanticipated side effects: increased communication/cooperation between schools and districts, parental involvement with courses, and mastery of a technology which students/teachers can apply to other  areas. Key issues and concerns in distance education relate to curriculum development, teacher training, student support, certification and accreditation, management and scheduling, costs, funding, evaluation, and program integration. An appendix provides delivery, cost, and contact information on the projects, satellite systems, and statewide networks described in the report. (NEC)",

Assessment information came from client follow-up surveys, requests for NWREL services, NWREL advisory committee input, a local education agency survey, a school improvement organization survey, and state-level school improvement agency planning meetings. Identified needs included: (1) intervention/prevention models for students at risk of school failure due to substance abuse, handicap, language, ethnicity, economic status, delinquency or other  factors; (2) models for structuring school programs to better serve students, prepare them for technological change, and integrate basic skills with life skills, vocational skills, reasoning skills; (3) closer linkages between teacher education institutions and public school systems to better prepare and upgrade teachers; (4) methods to promote public awareness and local support for schools; (5) identification of characteristics of effective school administrators and development of training programs; and (6) identification and dissemination of promising educational practices among small, rural schools. Needs in NWREL priority areas included partnerships between schools and businesses/human resource agencies, teacher evaluation, professional development, school-based management, and  technological awareness.

The paper discusses the model's underlying concepts and implementation process and includes descriptions of four workshops held in the western United States. It describes training methods and cites examples of participants in Montana, New Mexico, and Washington who applied the process to local situations, and speculates about further applications. Goals for workshop participants representing 29 communities included becoming more knowledgeable about fiscal, social, economic, and demographic consequences of decline, resources available to help cope with  decline, processes of informing and involving people at home, and strategies for economic and social recovery. Aspects of workshop development included multidisciplinary approach, needs assessment and action planning, impact assessment, management and mitigation framework, case study, and action planning process. Success of the training model is attributed to the synergism of the team approach, the model's transferability and adaptability, the multiplier effect potential, and trainer-team followup. (LFL)",

Mathematics achievement was only one component: the overall objective was to learn about the teaching of mathematics, what was taught, how it was taught, and what methods were most successful. Chapter 1 reviews the design of SIMS and describes how different interpretations of the two populations to be studied led to quite different samples of students from country to country. The second chapter is concerned with the officially mandated curriculum. Characteristics of Ontario schools and teachers are described in this chapter and compared with schools and teachers in other countries. Ontario student achievement and  attitudes are examined in chapter three. Achievement is discussed topic by topic in relation to other characteristics, with emphasis on students' opportunity to learn; gender differences are also explored. Attitudes are regarded as an outcome in their own right as well as in relation to achievement. The final chapter presents some of the lessons learned and plausible conclusions from the study. Results from Ontario are discussed mainly in the international context. A list of SIMS participants and a list of reports published or to be published on SIMS are appended. (MNS)",

Constructivist epistemology is described in terms of its emergence from rationalist, empiricist, and romanticist views of knowledge. Implications for science teaching are derived from Piaget's descriptions of social, physical, and logico-mathematical experiences as sources of knowledge. A study which exemplifies the confusion surrounding constructivism is then discussed. Support is given for the use of discovery methods on the grounds that they foster the construction of logico-mathematical knowledge better than do more direct  methods.

Each is described in terms of: (1) how it addresses the phases of exploration, term introduction, and concept application; (2) the steps used in preparing and using the cycle; (3) its application to a specific topic area, i.e., skull structure/function, air pressure, and transportation. If correctly used, it is contended that the learning cycle will provide the opportunity for students to reveal their prior conceptions and to test them in an open  atmosphere.

Included are major services provided, disabilities served, funding sources, annual budgets, education level of those served, and changes in residential status of those served. The brief descriptions of the characteristics and benefits of independent living centers provide only a  sampling of the activities currently taking place in actual operations. Seventeen case studies which feature stories about people and their experiences with independent living centers are included.

        "description":"A strong case can be made for increasing the hours of the social studies methods course from three to six semester hours. One of the major problems of secondary social studies classes is the unimaginative, unexciting, and predominant practice of transmitting unexamined and unquestioned facts and information to the students. Social studies education majors typically take from 45 to 60 hours of social science courses compared to 3 or 4 hours of social studies courses. This is an insufficient amount of time to help students to learn how to teach. The social studies methods course should be used to facilitate change and to help potential teachers learn current practices and concerns and learn and understand the theories that support social studies education. After years of effort, a  teacher at a southern university won acceptance for a 6-hour course consisting of 2 sequential 3-hour courses. The two sets of course outlines are presented in an appendix. The first course relates to the definition and purpose of social studies education, recent research, trends and issues, and instructional approaches. The second course is designed to develop skills necessary for effective social studies classroom instruction. (KWL)",

In an Old Order Amish education, children are taught the &quot;four R's:&quot; reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion, designed specifically for use within their culture. Responsibility for work is also an essential ingredient in Amish education since an Old Order Amish child has more work to do than a child on a modern farm. The lack of modern farming practices provides opportunities for many chores for the children. Old Order Amish education emphasizes caring for others and sharing one's goods and services. All age groups participate in  barn raisings for other families and contribute to the farm and household work if an Amish member is ill or dies. Religious beliefs are the heart of Amish education.

It creates the institutions of government, enumerates the powers of these institutions, and delineates areas government may not enter. The Constitution is the instrument by which the consent of the governed is transformed into a government. Constitutional law is that body of law which has resulted from the Supreme Court's adjudications involving disputes over constitutional provisions or doctrines. A constitutional law decision does not establish the &quot;supreme Law of the Land&quot; that is binding on all persons and parts of government, henceforth and forevermore. Rather, Constitutional law is the product of judicial interpretation of the  supreme law of the land, the Constitution. Officials of the executive and the legislative branches of government also have the duty and responsibility to interpret the Constitution. The speech concludes with an examination of important events in U.S. history related to the Constitution, with emphasis on landmark cases and decisions of the Supreme Court. A brief historical review of the development of the U.S. Constitution and challenges faced by the country precedes the main discussion. (KWL)",

Upon completion of learner analyses and content development, the development of objectives, flow  charts, and specific content in the form of modules was carried out. The use of interactive videodisks allowed learner choice and self-pacing, active learning, feedback, and exposure to multi-sensory learning sources. The paper concludes with a description of field testing and research, and a summary of the value of videodisks in social studies teacher preparation. A list of references is included. (KWL)",

        "description":"This book focuses on the history of the Statue of Liberty National Monument from 1952 through 1982. It describes how the monument has come to symbolize an expanding set of ideals, how the symbolism has produced responses in various groups of people ranging from celebrations to physical attacks upon the Statue, and the manner in which the monument is administered and maintained. This study includes accounts of the conception, financing, and development of the American Museum of Immigration, as well as the history of the incorporation of Ellis Island in the monument. The book contains eight chapters: (1) &quot;The Statue of Liberty: Monument to an Expanding Set of Ideals&quot;; (2) &quot;A Project Is Proposed and Financed&quot;; (3) &quot;The American Museum of Immigration Takes Shape&quot;; (4) &quot;The First  Decade of the American Museum of Immigration, 1972-1982&quot;; (5) &quot;What Shall We Do With Ellis Island? 1954-1965&quot;; (6) &quot;The Years of Neglect and Deterioration, 1965-1976&quot;; (7) &quot;The Search for Consensus and Funding Continues, 1976-1980&quot;; and (8) &quot;Preparing for the Centennials of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.&quot; Included are appendices giving annual visitation figures and names of monument supervisors, notes on sources, seven figures, and 10 full page black and white photographs.

        "author":["Schrodt, Philip A."],
        "description":"A &quot;world model&quot; is constructed where precedent-searching is one of the primary driving mechanisms. The simulation assumes that nations in the system are utility maximizers but that they have relatively primitive decision mechanisms and that they are strongly influenced by their previous short-term successful behavior and the short-term success of other states in the system. This model of foreign policy decision-making has been heavily influenced by recent artificial intelligence studies and simulations. States in the simulation follow one of three distinct strategies to maximize growth: imperialism, militarism, or trade and, in each mode, a state can increase or decrease its level of behavior, or it can switch modes. The objective of simulation is to get away from the purely  mechanistic difference equation formulations of world models while avoiding overly rational and optimizing models. Precedent-based decision-making is plausible for a goal-seeking system which, because of bureaucratic constraints, is capable of only fairly simple behaviors. The simulation uses a system vaguely characteristic of the 19th century world system with 5 large, 5 medium, and 10 small nations. The resulting behavior is generally plausible with bounded and fairly diverse activity depending on the random experimentation involved. Because of the weak bounded rationality, the system does not lock on to a single pattern of behavior based on initial conditions and so, for example, siutations exist where medium powers eventually become stronger than the initial major powers. The most  common pattern is one of a combination of trade links and imperialism, with about half the minor powers being colonized and some exchange of colonies occurring through conflict. An appendix, &quot;Key Elements of PWorld Program&quot;, and a bibliography are included. (Author/KWL)",

Attention is drawn to the limits of educational research based on untenable assumptions about human behavior so that more fruitful perspectives on the role of research may be developed and so that future research undertakings may be more likely to produce knowledge to inform and sensitize decision-makers. The paper also examines the following topics: (1) teachers' lack of access to research findings and the limited use of such findings; (2) the contradiction between two goals of research: the desire to help  practitioners and the desire to contribute to the body of scientific knowledge; (3) the appropriateness of the empirical-scientific approach in building knowledge; and (4) how meta-analysis fits into the research picture.

        "description":"\"Literacy\" is a hot buzzword for schools today. This is evident from the number of \"literacies\" that are making claims on the traditional subject-matter territory of the pre-college curriculum. Typically, each subject area of the school is asked to play a role in the achievement of these \"literacies.\" Such is the case with \"technological literacy\" and the social studies curriculum. Focusing on the secondary curriculum only, this paper examines whether social studies should play a role in the development of technological literacy, and whether social studies is equipped to play a role in the development of technological literacy, specifically at the secondary level. The former task requires the formulation of a defensible rationale for social studies becoming involved in such a  literacy effort, given the fundamental purposes of social studies education. The latter requires the design of a curricular framework within which the social studies' role may be most effectively performed, consistent with the content and methods of social studies education at the secondary level. After describing this framework, the paper concludes that the development of technological literacy is consistent with the purposes of social studies education and that the framework proposed should sharpen students' awareness not only of current social impacts of science and technology but also of issues arising from now unforseen scientific achievements and new technologies.

        "description":"This manual is designed to guide the implementation of the Joining Forces Program, a comprehensive improvement process for secondary schools. Implementation of the program requires the cooperative effort of the local school district, state and local education associations, and the administration and staff of participating schools. Joining Forces is a result of a careful review of available research on effective schools and other organizations, studies of the processes of change in secondary schools, and knowledge of exemplary organizational practices. Organizational diagnosis using factors based on research is combined with intensive team building, priority setting, and problem-solving techniques to produce an individualized improvement plan and building commitment to that plan  which meets the needs of the total school community. Manual sections discuss: program rationale, principles, and goals; cooperative agreements; orientation; coordinating council formation; creation of the school profile; council retreat; task group formation; action strategy and improvement plan; presentation of plan; implementation; evaluation; and revision and renewal. Sample survey materials are included. (CB)",

Data were obtained from two instruments: the Differential Loneliness Scale (DLS) and the Social Risk-Taking Scale (SRT). The DLS measures individuals' satisfaction with interpersonal relationships in four areas--romantic-sexual, friendships, and familial and community relationships. The SRT assesses the degree of comfort experienced by an individual in a variety of social situations. The results indicated a moderate relationship between the DLS, the SRT scales, and a self-rated loneliness measure on the one hand and a mental health index on the other. Social psychological variables were found to be  more closely linked to mental health than physical health, and the relationships were generally stronger for females than for males. (Author/JD)",

A comprehensive, structured telephone survey was conducted to evaluate the resource teachers' performances of their responsibilities. A total of 98 teachers were interviewed. Specifically, the objectives of this research study were to: (1) identify the responsibilities which resource teachers performed frequently or  in which they felt deficient; (2) identify training needs of the resource teachers; and (3) identify procedural, administrative, logistical, and other similar problems and determine their impact on the resource teacher's performance.

The third group are also postbaccalaureates who were selected to participate in a well-coordinated one-year program (Lyndhurst Fellowship Program) leading to teacher certification. The broad goal of the Lyndhurst Program is to recruit academically talented graduates of liberal arts colleges to teaching and  to develop and test an accelerated and clinically based program. A description is given of the salient components of the Lyndhurst Program and of the methodology used in making a comparative study of the three programs.

The paper focuses on the opportunities offered to teachers who work with mentors. Through the presentation of a selection of vignettes of teachers who worked with mentors, the paper suggests that the mentorship can provide the occasion for changing the norm of isolation to a norm of collegial assistance. Outcomes for teachers included companionship and assurance, access to models of teaching, adjustments in teaching practices, and, to a lesser extent, support for thinking about teaching. A secondary purpose of the paper was to describe some of the problems that several mentors encountered in asserting their role, such as  the lack of organizational support, suspicion and jealousy from other teachers, and a dilemma about how to assert themselves.

The CS-sponsored longitudinal study, &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; (HS&amp;B), was used as the data source for estimates; the information on coursework credits earned and grade point averages was taken from high school transcripts and questionnaires. Data shows that 80 percent of 1982 high school seniors participated in extracurricular activities. Except for hobby clubs and vocational education clubs, participation rates tended to be highest for students who were from high socioeconomic status backgrounds, who were pursuing an academic curriculum, and who made good (B+ or better) school  grades. Differences in participation rates among racial-ethnic groups tended to be small. Two exceptions were varsity athletics and chorus or dance, with a higher percentage of black students participating. The more activities students were involved in, the higher they ranked academically, indicating that extracurricular activities attract many bright, high-performing students. An overwhelming majority of extracurricular activity participants would meet the requirements of a cumulative 2.0 grade point average (GPA). Included in the report are technical notes on methodology and charts relating extracurricular activity and student characteristics to percentage of 1982 seniors who had a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or more.

        "description":"The term &quot;underclass,&quot; which refers to the concentration of economic and behavioral problems among racial minorities (mainly Black and Hispanic) in large, older cities, accurately describes a real and new condition in the United States social structure. In a sense, the rise of the underclass is an effect of the success of American social policy: the civil rights revolution caused a bifurcation of the racial minority groups. As upwardly mobile and educated members of racial minority groups have moved out of the ghetto, the people left behind have become more isolated and their problems have increased. Underclass conditions are economic, behavioral and attitudinal, and geographically focused. The concentration of poor Blacks and Hispanics in urban poverty areas is well documented,  and little descriptive research is still required. For makers of urban and social policy, therefore, the time has come to shift focus from diagnosis to prescription, and to address the needs and problems of the underclass. The philosophy of the Great Society has given way to a newly emerging social philosophy, adopted by conservatives and liberals, which synthesizes three approaches to welfare reform: guaranteed income, job provision, and block grants. One new trend, workfare, has shown promising effectiveness in reducing welfare dependency, and its emphasis on jobs appeals to the new reform mentality. Appended are tables presenting detailed data on the characteristics of poor people in 14 of the 100 largest cities in the United States. (KH)",

Using an enrichment approach, the project provided supplementary instruction in English as a second language (ESL), native language arts, and native language instruction in mathematics, science, and social studies. In the first year of a three-year funding cycle, the project was not able to realize all of its original goals. Installation delays prohibited the opening of a bilingual computer-education enrichment center at Brandeis, and funding delays stalled the work of a resource specialist at Bushwick. Project goals were not met in the areas of staff development and parental  involvement, but student achievement objectives were met in ESL, native language arts, content areas, and student attendance. Day-to-day operation of the program might be improved by: developing closer contact between Brandeis and the central office and between the staffs of the two participating sites, improving the physical space of the computer centers at each school, and collecting all the data necessary to assess all program objectives.

Two school factors that are consistently important in predicting a magnet school's success are location and curriculum. The report provides the following information: (1) a review of research on white flight and the effectiveness of alternative desegregation  plans; (2) the goals of a school desegregation plan; (3) the relative effectiveness of different magnet school programs; (4) the relative effectiveness of alternative desegregation plans (voluntary versus mandatory); (5) national desegregation trends from the 1960s through 1984; and (6) report findings and policy recommendations.

        "description":"At each age learning is a complex interaction of motivation, cognition, and development. In older adults, motivation is often related to a lifelong personality construct or personal meaning that an older individual will seek to play out when given the opportunity in late life. The needs of the older adult learner can be discussed in terms of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which include physiological, safety, love and belongingness, esteem, self-actualization, knowledge and understanding, and aesthetic needs. A review of the theories of various developmentalists suggests that because older adults often have the opportunity to play out the repressed sides of their personalities for the first time and need to relive past experiences, pass their legacy to future generations, and find  meaning in their lives, they may be best equipped for reminiscent learning. Studies of intelligence have suggested that there are two areas of intelligence, crystallized and fluid. The indications are that older people continue to do well in, and perhaps even improve in, the former type, which involves verbal comprehension, syllogisms, and arithemtical reasoning. Thus, older adults may very well be best equipped to make sense of things than are the members of any other age group. (MN)",

        "description":"The study described in this report investigated the effects of two context variables on small-group learning--namely, group size and group gender composition--within an adult learning framework. In the study, the &quot;revolving circle&quot; method was innovated. In this design, one group member is the center of the cooperative circle and all discussions are around his/her task completion. The method was implemented for a period of 2 months, 4 hours per week in seven different classrooms in Haifa, Israel, taught by four teachers in literature and language arts. Students in each class were randomly assigned to groups of different size (three, four, or five group members) and different gender composition (majority male or female). Two trained female observers watched each classroom for six  full periods of 90 minutes each, and coded behavior for 5 minutes using a checklist. Observed behaviors were grouped in six categories: listening and social interaction, group maintenance, interactive summary, giving and requesting information, cooperative learning behaviors, and general learning behaviors. The study found that most of the significant differences occurred in odd-number groups. Groups of three members elicited more integrative summary and general learning behaviors, while groups of five members elicited more cooperative learning behaviors, listening, and social interaction. The study also found that cooperative learning behavior was significantly higher in groups with either gender majority, while giving information was highest in equal gender composition groups. The  results of the study can be used in further research on group learning behavior. (KC)",

Data were collected in accordance with a three-block, temporally ordered causal model. The first part of the survey instrument sought data pertaining to teacher and school background variables, the second part consisted of Camp and Bourn's Student Misbehavior Survey, and the third part was based on the Brayfield-Rothe Index of Job Satisfaction. The study population was defined as all teachers of vocational agriculture teaching in the United States during the 1981-1982 school year and listed in the &quot;Agriculture Teachers Directory&quot; (N=12,726). A final systematic sample with a random start was used to select a final sample of 605 teachers. The  standardized coefficients leading to job satisfaction--student behavior and its square--both had substantial direct effects on job satisfaction (-.510 and +.413 respectively). Thus, as the teacher's perceived level of student misbehavior increases, job satisfaction decreases. This decrease in job satisfaction occurs, however, at a decreasing rate. Although student misbehavior problems contribute to lowered job satisfaction, the effect of misbehavior tends to become marginally less pronounced as misbehavior problems continue to increase. Also found to be significant were the relationships between job satisfaction and coefficients for years of teaching experience and community type. (MN)",

Questionnaires were developed and mailed to 136 persons, with a return rate of 68 percent. Most of the respondents were white female registered nurses with a mean age of 44 years, who were graduates of three year nursing programs or community colleges. Data were collected and analyzed to yield the following conclusions: (1) health education risk reduction skills training was needed; (2) a training plan needed to be developed to include patient counseling skills, small group instruction techniques, diabetes education, nutrition education, maternal health risk reduction, child abuse, and interpersonal communication techniques;  (3) district-wide conferences should be organized on domestic violence and physical fitness, nutrition, and health; and (4) health education methods training should precede other health education-risk reduction training when possible. Using these results, a training plan was developed and implemented at five training sites. Six training courses and four special interest courses were developed and taught by guest instructors at several training sites. Most of the CPHU nurses have received training, and most have rated the courses as very helpful. Changes in attitude and the application of learned skills were to be measured by the re-administration of the survey in March 1985. (KC)",

Understanding and improving the knowledge, cognitive abilities, and dispositions that guide, organize, and form effective action in the workplace, home, and community are significant problems for vocational education. This document provides an overview of educational and learning problems and reviews theory and research findings concerning the mechanisms by which people take in, process, store, combine, retrieve, and use information in directing, performing, and controlling operations, understanding and affecting situations, interpreting experience, identifying and solving problems, and making decisions and judgments. An agenda for inquiry is  presented that reflects existing knowledge about higher order thinking, identifies potential ways of determining how and to what extent vocational education involves the application of higher order thinking skills, and leads to development of curricular and instructional models in vocational education that incorporate and develop higher order thinking. The inquiry agenda is divided into three interrelated parts. Part I concerns identifying and organizing problems and contexts central in vocational education. Part II concerns descriptions, documentation, and understanding of the knowledge, cognitive abilities, and dispositions required by the problems and contexts identified in Part I. Part III focuses on identifying, developing, and assessing curricular designs and instructional processes  that facilitate development of the required knowledge, cognitive abilities, and dispositions.

The concept of &quot;skill&quot; and categories of skill are explored and defined. Chapter I discusses the concept of transferable skills. It looks at labor market issues and how they relate to the need for transferable skills. Developments in training practices are considered to see how they relate to the provision of transferable skills. Training issues are trade teachers, mobility and productivity, competence, and labor market. Chapter II looks at the two groups of skills that have been identified as enhancing job mobility: skills a student will require  to complete a course of training and/or retraining and skills needed during a working life. The relationship between skills in the two groups and their usefulness in vocational curriculum design is discussed. Chapter III first considers three curriculum delivery methods relevant to delivery of transferable skills: competency-based delivery, individualized instruction, and modular instruction. Next, DACUM (Develop a Curriculum) is recommended as the most appropriate method for curriculum development for transferable skills. Finally, teacher participation is addressed. Chapter IV outlines the proposed strategy for instilling transferable skills into vocational curricula. A four-page list of references is provided. (YLB)",

Haigler, director of the Adult Literacy Initiative, U.S. Department of Education; and Patricia Keeton, coordinator, Basic Skills and Foreign-Born Programs, Howard Community College, Maryland. In his testimony and written report, Governor Baliles commented that many people who are illiterate turn to a life of crime. He reported that since many of the prisoners in the Virginia system are illiterate, the state has begun a program of &quot;no read, no release&quot; to teach prisoners to read before they are sent back into society. In  his testimony, Duffy reported on the experience of ABC and the Public Broadcasting Service in Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), which spotlights the problem of illiteracy; broadcasters work through their stations to reach adult illiterates and help them find educational programs to meet their needs. Haigler defended the budget needs of U.S. literacy efforts and said that financial support is crucial to help adults to read. Finally, Keeton testified that more must be done to fight illiteracy and that it is unproductive to publicize the problem while cutting funds for adult education. A discussion among committee members and participants is also included in the hearing proceedings. (KC)",

        "description":"The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a study of employment practices at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to determine if practices for employing and advancing disabled veterans comply with applicable legislation. The study found that TVA's plans describing its Disabled Vererans' Affirmative Action Program were meeting regulatory requirements in fiscal year 1986. TVA has had mixed results in achieving the objectives identified in the plans. Because of declines in TVA's work force (a 42 percent reduction from 1980 to 1986), TVA's ability to hire and advance disabled veterans may have been affected. TVA has implemented activities aimed at achieving the following plan objectives: (1) providing awareness training to supervisory personnel; (2) establishing an advisory  committee of handicapped employees partly composed of disabled veterans; (3) providing guidance to managers and supervisors on how they could modify jobs to accommodate disabled veterans' abilities; and (4) adopting Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards to ensure barrier-free design in TVA facilities. The Disabled Veterans' Affirmative Action Program plan objectives that TVA has not been successful in implementing included the following: (1) increasing the number of disabled veterans on its employment register; (2) increasing disabled veterans' advancement opportunities within TVA through career planning and an upward mobility program; and (3) providing placement opportunities both within and outside TVA for disabled veterans scheduled for reductions-in-force. The TVA has recently hired  a disabled veteran to head a new veretans' affairs unit to deal with all veterans' issues. (KC)",

        "description":"The Government Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed 71 actuarial, behavioral, and economic models that are used for retirement forecasting, focusing on models of federal retirement program costs, civilian retirement decisions, and retirement income. GAO wished to determine to what extent the models have been documented, to what extent the models are updated and revised, and their forecasting accuracy. Of the 71 models GAO reviewed, 32 were program cost models, 35 were retirement decision models, and 4 were retirement income models. GAO found that documented models do exist for all three retirement outcomes and that considerable effort has been made in their development and maintenance. However, model forecasts are vulnerable in several areas, including the adequacy of model  documentation, the frequency or recency of model maintenance, the existence of evaluative information on model validity, and the quality of model data. With regard to documentation, GAO found that while models in all three categories have been documented, the amount, completeness, and content of the documentation varies. With regard to model maintenance or updating, this occurs regularly for program cost models, infrequently for retirement decision models, and periodically for retirement income models. Therefore, for some models, projections are based on antiquated data. With regard to validity (forecasting accuracy), GAO found that there is a serious lack of published information for most models and little evidence that serious attempts at validation are being made. The GAO concluded  that Congress may wish to provide additional guidance to federal agencies responsible for the development and maintenance of retirement forecasting models. (KC)",

Young parents were to be referred by the General Social Services Agency (GSS), given educational assessments, and grouped according to reading level. They were to receive a stipend for transportation and child care. The program, which served 37 students, had some limited success. The educational and child care components and the transportation subsidy were implemented. Teachers generally looked upon the program favorably and identified strongly with the program  goals. Students looked on the program favorably and judged that their basic skills and knowledge of useful occupational skills increased over the course of the program. Six participants passed the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) exam. Problems were poor articulation between GSS and SEED, late receipt of funds for carfare and baby sitting, and lack of data needed to measure the achievement of program objectives. (YLB)",

To make a successful transition, farm families need personal support, which could include counseling, moral support, help in assessing their financial condition, and legal and technical information to help them adjust to new circumstances and make decisions in selling their farm assets. Displaced farm families need financial bridges--a source of income until they can obtain work in the nonfarm sector. They also need help to find work. Skills assessment, classroom and on-the-job training, and job search and relocation assistance can help them find new work. The main federally funded source of help is the dislocated worker programs authorized by  the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Displaced farmers may be eligible for still other JTPA programs.

        "description":"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), between 1981 and 1986 approximately 10.8 million persons lost jobs in a manner suggesting that the job losses would be permanent. Experienced workers with three or more years of tenure made up about 5.1 million of the total number of individuals whom BLS reports have termed &quot;displaced workers.&quot; When such dislocation affects a large number of workers in one area, both the affected workers and their communities can be devastated. Although many employers, particularly the larger ones, appear to feel obligated to assist dislocated workers, many appear to do little, if anything, before, during, or after a mass layoff. The responses from government have also been spotty and rather narrowly focused. After examining the methods that have  been adopted by other industrialized countries to facilitate the adjustment of workers dislocated by structural change, the Task Force on Economic Adjustment and Worker Dislocation concluded that the most successful dislocated worker adjustment programs are those in which employers and workers are directly involved in program design and delivery. An identifiable public agency should be available to assist dislocated workers, and linkages and coordination between public and private efforts to assist dislocated workers must be expanded. The task force formulated 10 specific recommendations for policymakers to consider in the area of worker dislocation. The document includes an extensive chart outlining federal employee protection law from 1887 to 1979. (Appendixes making up about two-thirds  of the document include an evaluation of programs to assist displaced workers in foreign industrialized countries, longitudinal establishment data, BLS data, case studies, a report on private sector practices, selected references, and a dissenting view written by Richard McKenzie.)

        "description":"Vocational training in Spain suffers from a fundamental initial disadvantage, namely the subsidiary position that it occupies in the general structure of the country's educational system. The situation has been aggravated by the sector's relative neglect by the government, which has been forced to concentrate its efforts on secondary and university education as a result of the rapid population growth that occurred throughout the 1970s. The remainder of society is also rather uninterested in vocational training and views it primarily as the educational option for those who do not successfully complete their elementary education. The general attitude from industry is that vocational education does not provide adequate preparation for today's jobs and that its content is not geared  toward meeting industry's needs. More than once, the government has recognized the need for closer cooperation with the employment sector in planning course content and developing occupational profiles to guide vocational training. In general, however, the lack of labor planning and clear employment forecasts have allowed vocational education to continue concentrating on sectors of the job market that are currently saturated and to give inadequate attention to sectors that are currently expanding or of vital importance to the economy. As in academic education, theory is given preeminence over practice in vocational training. The lack of teaching resources appropriate to preparation for the contemporary world of work is another of the problems inherent in the vocational education system.  Closer links between vocational education and industry are difficult to establish since the formal vocational training system begins at age 14, which is two years before youth can legally hold jobs. A map of Europe and two diagrams are provided in color; tables, figures, and a bibliography are also included. (MN)",

        "description":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) farm real estate value index is currently constructed with a modified Laspeyres weighted average formula, with the acreage weights changed approximately every 10 years. An analysis of acreage weights from 1974, 1978, and 1982 census data revealed, however, that substantial changes in real estate values at the state level had occurred within the time period studied. The current formula for determining farm real estate value indexes would improve if a more frequent weighting scheme were used. Updating the acreage weights every 5 years instead of every 10 years would better represent current land use patterns and provide more consistency with the USDA dollar value farm real estate series. Two ways of improving the USDA indexing methods are  possible--altering the modified Laspeyres formula or switching to a Divisia formula. The modified Laspeyres formula with weights updated every 5 years is recommended because it is more understandable to users, whereas the statistical benefits of the Divisia formula are uncertain for a farm real estate value index. A table is provided that shows that when the 1984-1985 percent change estimates are weighted with 1974, 1978, and 1982 census estimates for land in farms the estimates for the lower 48 states decrease by 14%, 14%, and 13% for the 3 years, respectively.

Cash receipts, which measure gross production value, peaked in 1981 at $14.94 per hundredweight compared with $9.23 in 1975. Production costs in the Pacific region were more than $1 per hundredweight lower than costs in other regions every year during the period from 1975 to 1984. Appalachia and the Corn Belt had the highest costs. In 1983, the Economic Research Service revised its cost-of-production estimating procedures and cost-and-return budget formats to incorporate new concepts and methodologies. The old estimate format contained an estimate of variable costs and costs imputed to the operator-supplied  inputs (including machinery, overhead, management, and land). The current format, on the other hand, contains the following three major categories of revised cost-and-return measures: cash receipts, cash costs (including variable and fixed expenses), and economic costs (which are the sum of farm overhead, taxes and insurance, capital replacement charges, and interest on loans). Cash receipts, variable and fixed cash expenses, and economic costs computed according to the old estimate format were then readjusted to make the old and new estimates consistent.

Two presentations made at the Southern Regional Education Board's meeting on \"Strengthening the Academic Preparation of Vocational Students\" appear first. \"The Heart of Educational Reform: Integrating Academic and Vocational Education\" (Marvin Feldman) advocates linking academic learning to practical vocational applications. \"Investing in Our Children: Business and the Public Schools\" (Nat Semple) also talks about the relationship between vocational education and academic instruction. The summaries of nine various approaches to strengthen basic competencies are divided into three  categories. The categories and programs are Teaching, Strengthening, and Recognizing Academic Skills (The Division of Academic-Vocational Education--Holmes High School, Kentucky; The Virginia Master Technician Program; Individualized Language Arts and Systematic Teaching and Measuring of Mathematics/Vocational Applied Mathematics--Georgia; Florida's State Policy for Credit Substitution); Using Applied Courses to Develop Academic Learning Skills (Principles of Technology--The Center for Occupational Research and Development, Applied Vocational Mathematics--South Carolina, Correlated Vocational/Academic Programs--Ohio); and Remediating Basic Skills Deficiencies in Vocational Students (Individualized Remedial-Related Centers--Mississippi, Learning Resource Centers--Oklahoma).

        "description":"This report describes the activities of five federal agencies as they made the transition from merit pay to the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) during fiscal year 1985. It also discusses how PMRS addressed the problems identified with merit pay. In addition, the report presents information on the pay increases and performance awards provided to PMRS employees in fiscal year 1985 and discusses the initial perceptions of selected employees on PMRS operations. Some of the findings of the study are that the agencies lacked lead time in implementing the new system, that the change was difficult, that some agencies incorrectly calculated pay increases, and that continuing problems exist such as significant differences among the agencies in raises for employees with  the same grade and rating, and with the distribution of ratings. Employees express distrust of the performance appraisal systems and are concerned that insufficient funds are available to reward performance adequately. The General Accounting Office recommends that the formula for computing general pay increases be clarified; other recommendations were not made in this report because PMRS has been in use for only one year.

        "description":"The National Literacy Campaign of Zimbabwe was launched in July, 1983. The objectives of the campaign were to enable adults (1) to understand information about themselves, their localities, and their country; and (2) to become effective leaders and productive members of their cooperatives, village committees, management committees, and other organizations to which they might belong. The campaign was aimed at all illiterate people outside formal schools. The campaign was planned by the Ministry of Education and Culture, which made contributions through production of materials, training, and evaluation, and by the Ministry of Community Development and Women's Affairs through its community development workers. A curriculum was developed, and posters and an instructional kit for  tutors were created. Classes typically meet three times a week for two hours, and adult learners usually stay 6 to 18 months in their learning groups. Evaluations of the Zimbabwean National Literacy Campaign showed that some progress had been made, but that more women than men were involved, and some ideological corrections should be made. A model is proposed to describe the relationship between a nation's political culture and the literacy promotion strategy that a nation would normally choose. Although the literacy campaign in Zimbabwe had lofty goals, the economic development of the nation may not be ready for universal literacy. However, there is no reason why economic development and literacy development cannot grow together. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the effects of career guidance and counseling on intermediate outcomes measured while respondents remained in high school and on employment and educational outcomes measured after respondents left high school. Data from the 1980 sophomore and senior cohorts of the High School and Beyond database were subjected to multivariate analyses. These analyses strongly replicated findings of past research regarding the impact of status background and personal characteristics on career expectations and performance measures. These variables also affected college-going behavior and exhibited smaller and more erratic patterns of effects on early labor market variables (hours and weeks worked and unemployment, but not wage). Career expectation variables and perceived ability to  complete college also exhibited strong positive effects on college attendance measures and tended to have negative effects on the work variables, whereas general attitudes such as self-esteem and locus of control did not have strong effects on post-high school job or education outcomes. The effects of guidance program variables, on the other hand, are rather small and manifest some erratic patterns. Youth who attended schools emphasizing counseling tended to have higher career goals and attend college more than other youth, and youth who attended schools for which counselor respondents expressed positive attitudes about the guidance program also tended to have higher career goals and college attendance. Youth attending schools emphasizing occupational information, however, had lower  growth on test scores than did other youth. Recommendations for improving career guidance programs are included. A seven-page list of references concludes the document. (MN)",

The project, which was funded through the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Act, was intended to help staff examine their own personal attitudes about sex roles, heighten awareness of the harmful effects of sexism in the classroom, encourage all staff to meet nontraditional role models, provide teachers with information and skills to recognize sex bias and stereotyping in the classroom, and present suggestions and strategies for working with adult students in a nonsexist manner. Each of the eight workshops was taught by a coordinator and was two and one-half hours long. Each workshop  included 30 minutes of teaching techniques and suggestions for working with adult learners, and the rest of each session consisted of a pretest, group discussion, attitude survey, presentation of information about sex fairness in the adult classroom, a group activity to help participants learn to evaluate written material for sex-fair language, and a participant evaluation. The workshops ended with a posttest and evaluation of the presentation and content. (Attachments to the project report include a list of do's and don'ts on attempting to effect changes in schools, project-related correspondence, data on workshop attendance and outcomes, a workshop evaluation form, a guide to bias-free language, a gender communications quiz, and a sex role attitudes survey.)

        "description":"In recent years there have been a few systematic attempts to restructure social psychology in which all have concurred that there is a dearth of provocative and meaningful theoretical contributions in contemporary social psychology. Current theories are unnecessarily limited in scope. These theories are fragmented, have limited implications, lack a common framework, and fail to explicate underlying assumptive bases. Contemporary social psychological theorizing is dominated by the practice of working with theories (verification) instead of working on theories (explanation). Whereas the former practice casts theory in a role secondary to data collection by neglecting extrascientific influences, the latter incorporates sociohistorical determinants thereby elevating theory to a  position of fundamental importance in the description of social life. Consequences of continued allegiance to working with theories include lack of applicability to everyday life, an overemphasis on variables, and the neglect of meaning. The solution is not to end experiments or the hypothetico-deductive method, but to offset the relative inattention paid to theoretical endeavors. Working on theories will require a major shift in the primary activities of many persons engaged in social psychological research which will engender a flexibility that will contribute to an enriched understanding of social life.

Although psychiatric inpatient treatment is largely exempt from the constraints of the Medicare diagnosis related groups (DRG's), length of stay for geropsychiatric hospital services has decreased also. A trend toward higher rates of early readmission and a greater probability of a more restrictive setting has been observed. Community mental health centers have apparently been overwhelmed by the needs of earlier discharged elderly persons. An intermediary program to carry the patient from hospital discharge to ongoing aftercare through a firm establishment of an outpatient therapeutic relationship at a psychiatric aftercare facility was undertaken utilizing nurse therapy. The  goal of this intervention was to aid the former psychiatric inpatient in his transition to an outpatient psychiatric system. It was not intended to replace outpatient therapy, but to formalize a link between the helping networks. A preliminary evaluation has shown that the nursing intensive care model may have been a factor in the return to previous rates of recidivism and disposition. Although data demonstrating the impact of nursing interim care apart from other factors is needed, this nurse therapy model does provide continuity of care from hospital ward therapy through the clinic.

Who a potential victim turns to for help initially and how capable that person is in recognizing the signs of potential suicide are critical issues not fully addressed by research. A study was conducted to examine the ability of various service providers to identify lethality factors. The Thirteen Questions on Successful Suicide and the Survey of Professional Experiences with Suicidal Clients were completed by physicians (N=22), doctoral level clinical or counseling psychologists (N=14), master's level counselors (N=33), master's level social workers (N=12), ministers (N=19), and lower division college students (N=27). The results revealed no significant differences in the number of  correct responses by physicians, psychologists, and counselors, but all three groups scored significantly higher than all of the other groups. Social workers scored significantly higher than did ministers, and ministers scored significantly higher than did college students. An analysis of data by years of experience showed that those with 5-10 years of experience scored the highest, while the more experienced subjects had a drastic drop in scores. Only about 50% of responding psychologists, social workers, and counselors had experienced specific training in recognizing and working with suicidal clients. Those who had the most exposure to suicide were the ones who felt the strongest desire for additional information. (NB)",

Stress is defined and sources of distress are identified. Research is cited which examines sources of faculty or counselor stress. Issues such as time, money, reputation, significance, and concerns for the future are considered. Burnout, a distinctive kind of job-related stress, is examined as it relates to college and university personnel. Factors in the academic environment which contribute to stress and may lead to burnout are identified within the categories of role dynamics, responsibility, occupation, job  satisfaction, career paths, and the organization. Research exploring sources of student distress are also reviewed and contributors to student stress are outlined within the categories of instruction, competition, organization of time, adjustment to college, administrative problems, social adjustment, finance, housing, and transportation. Four preventive strategies and five combative strategies to help faculty members cope with stress are presented and six behaviors for faculty members to use in helping students handle stress are suggested.

        "description":"Although the contributions made by counseling psychologists to nursing homes has been marginal, there are several services that can be provided to long-term care facilities by psychologists. Once familiar with the pattern of nursing home life, the psychologist will be able to provide services indirectly as a consultant or trainer, and directly in the delivery of mental health services. As consultants and trainers, psychologists can influence continuing education programs often required of nursing home personnel to include training on mental health needs of nursing home residents. Four workshops developed to provide such education include: (1) Crisis Management in Older Persons; (2) The Family of the Nursing Home Resident: Adversary or Advocate; (3) Using Volunteers in the Nursing  Home and Making It Work; and (4) Brief Interventions for Problem Behaviors of Residents. The most frequently requested direct service is for assessment of residents' mental status and treatment recommendations. If diagnostic reports and recommendations are used for care planning, the counseling psychologist can have input into the management of such predictable resident behavior problems as oppositional and noncompliant behavior, depression, agitation and anxiety, social withdrawal, and cognitive disorientation. Although the magnitude of mental health problems in nursing homes and the inadequacy of current services concern counseling psychologists, the problems of adequate and legitimate financial reimbursement must be addressed at a national level if professionals are to be attracted to  the field of geriatric mental health in long-term care settings.

        "description":"Techniques of cognitive behavior modification such as cognitive restructuring have recently been employed in behavior therapy. Other procedures which fall within the approach of cognitive behavior therapy are techniques such as paradoxical intention which are subsumed under the title of logotherapy. Logotherapy refers to a form of psychotherapy or counseling which operates through developing a meaningful life. There is an emphasis on synthesizing psychodynamic approaches, existentialist views, and a broad learning theory or cognitive behavior modification perspective. In response to unemployment, individuals may react with wrong passivity, wrong activity, right passivity, or right activity. In cases where an active response to unemployment is limited, logotherapeutic techniques  such as paradoxical intention may be used to stimulate the right passive approach to the problems of unemployment. Paradoxical intention asks clients to experience the anxiety of their unemployment and to exaggerate the tensions associated with unemployment in an attempt to assist clients in developing changes in their attitudes and reactions to stress. This approach may prove useful in addressing career guidance problems in vocational services. (NB)",

        "description":"Machell's Theory of Power was developed to provide students in organizational theory two formulas of relationships to apply to organizational situations and organizational power. Formula 1 indicates that the level of power of person A is determined by the level of dependency that person B has on person A; and that person A's power can be substantiated or changed by the use of Formula 2. In Formula 2, person A uses a stressor stimulus to illicit fear in person B, which fosters a realization of the fullness of person B's dependency on person A, therefore solidifying or increasing person A's power. The overuse of Formula 2 by person A may motivate person B to lessen his/her dependency on person A. When this occurs, person A may lose power over person B. These formulas can also be  used in counseling situations, by either the counselor or the client. Since the level of dependency of one person on another helps to determine power, it is important to explore the issue of dependency in the counseling relationship. The use of this power formula in counseling situations partially redefines the notions of transference and countertransference. Counselors need to be aware of power structures in counseling situations. (NB)",

It compares coverage for selected health benefits in the federal and private sectors for a 6-year period (1980-1985). A description of methodology states that information on federal benefits was obtained by reviewing coverage for 18 FEHBP plans and that private sector benefits information came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' survey &quot;Employee Benefits in Medium and Large Firms.&quot; Results are reported showing that, compared to private sector employees, federal employees were more likely to be covered for routine physicals, hospice care, and catastrophic illness; less likely to have dental, home health,  alcohol and drug abuse treatment, and extended care coverage; and similarly covered for mental health care. Also reported are findings that federal enrollees paid more of their health care costs in premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance than did private sector employees. The report examines three other aspects of federal coverage: (1) what it has recently cost plans to add coverage for certain health benefits; (2) what benefit changes have been made for mental health coverage; and (3) what use plans are making of certain cost containment efforts, such as second opinion programs and hospital utilization review.

        "description":"Although many individuals use alcohol to cope with stress (their behavior being based on the belief that alcohol can produce a relaxation effect), research has reported conflicting results on the effects of alcohol on tension reduction. A study was conducted to examine the psychophysiological effects of moderate levels of alcohol consumption under a resting state. College students (N=18) were randomly assigned to either an alcohol group or a control group. Baseline measurements of muscle tension, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and state anxiety were taken on all subjects before treatment. Subjects in the alcohol group consumed sufficient quantities of beer or wine to achieve a blood alcohol level of .05%. The control subjects received no specific treatment but had  the opportunity to read health-related magazines while waiting to be tested again. Following their respective treatments, all subjects were retested. An analysis of covariance was used to examine the differences of criterion measures between groups (pretest measures were used as covariates). The results of the analyses indicated that there were no significant differences in criterion measures between groups. These findings fail to support the belief that alcohol is effective in producing a relaxation effect. (Author/NB)",

In order to support the parents and seniors, a seminar on the topic of separation was given to parents and seniors by a child psychiatrist and two high school college advisors. The objective of the seminar was for both groups to become aware of the nature and significance of the upcoming change in their lives. Preparation for the separation process was facilitated by sharing universal concerns and practical advice, and by expressing feelings of loss. The seminar began with an introductory lecture by the psychiatrist focusing on stages of separation through the life cycle such as weaning, the possession  of transitional objects, day care, nursery school, sleepovers, summer camp, and the multiple separations of adolescence. After the psychiatrist's presentation, parents and seniors were separated into their respective groups. Open-ended questions such as \"What is the most exciting thing about (you, your child) going to college next year?\" were discussed by both groups. Responses were discussed, recorded, and brought back to the entire group, promoting interaction, ventilation, and a new awareness of this difficult phase of individuation. Because the workshop actively helped the transition processes and allayed much anxiety about separation, it has received a wide audience. (Advice for parents and seniors on coping with the first year of college is included.) (Author/ABL)",

At-risk students identified in the school setting include those exhibiting signs of alcohol consumption, drug abuse, or antisocial behavior. These students need assistance to overcome their problems and to achieve in school. When counseling in the school setting is not sufficient, these students need to be referred to appropriate services in the community. For some high school students, the immediate earnings from employment seem more significant than staying in school. These students need courses in vocational education and assistance to help them develop positive attitudes toward education,  perceive alternatives to dropping out, and realize the worth of long-term goals. Pregnant teenage girls, also at risk of dropping out, need counseling services to help them obtain their diplomas, learn job skills, and cope with their situations. Family situations, such as cultural differences between values taught at home and at school, separation, divorce, or a parent's loss of employment, can put students at risk of dropping out. School personnel need to determine causes of tardiness, absenteeism, and dropping out, and to provide necessary remediation. (NB)",

One problem, the diversion of legal drugs into the illegal market, can be accomplished by pharmacists, drug manufacturers and distributors, or by forged or fraudulent prescriptions. Pharmacists can combat this problem by self-policing and by providing drug education to the public. The federal government's efforts to curb the supply of illegal drugs have involved the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, United States Attorneys, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and at the international level, the Central Intelligence Agency, United States Customs, and the Coast Guard. Drug misuse is an especially serious problem in  schools. In New York, the Patchogue-Medford Board of Education requires probationary teachers to take a drug test as a condition of tenure. Teachers who have challenged this requirement as a violation of the Fourth Amendment have been supported by lower New York state courts. The United States Department of Justice, however, views freedom from drugs as a valid condition of employment for school teachers. Drug testing has been upheld when applied to race-track jockeys, prison guards, transportation workers, and to others whose jobs may impact public safety. Teachers, as role models for students, must present drug-free examples for students to follow, and schools must take a leadership role in the fight against drugs. (NB)",

Menopause is briefly described, surgical menopause is explained, and the relationship between menopause and the reproductive cycle is discussed. Signs of menopause are described, including hot flashes and vaginal and urinary tract changes. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is explained and women most at risk of developing osteoporosis are identified. Suggestions, in the form of lifelong eating and exercise habits, are given for preventing or delaying the onset of osteoporosis. Situations are discussed in which treatment is needed for menopause and available treatments, such as estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), are explored. Cases in which ERT should not be used are considered. Mental health during menopause is  discussed, mood changes and depression during menopause are described, and the role of sexuality during and after menopause is explained. The role of good nutrition in helping women stay healthy as they grow older is examined. The dangers of smoking and the need for physical exercise are also discussed. The book concludes with a list of other National Institute on Aging publications of interest to older women. (NB)",

        "description":"This paper notes that, although most private health insurance is obtained through the workplace, important gaps remain in the present system of employment-related coverage. National survey data are presented which revealed that more than 9 million persons with employment experience were uninsured, who, with their uninsured dependents, accounted for three-quarters of all persons who lacked coverage. This report examines the circumstances and characteristics of the employed uninsured, including their opportunity to secure health insurance fringe benefits, their medical care use and expenditures, and the benefits available in private insurance that is not work related. Findings are presented showing that, although workers who are young and poor are the most likely to be uninsured,  almost one-half of the employed uninsured are over 30 years old and one-half reside in middle- or high-income households. It is also noted that few of the employed uninsured are offered health insurance at the workplace, and they do not receive higher wages in place of health insurance fringe benefits. Alternative public policy responses to the problem of lack of health insurance coverage are also considered, including: (1) mandated employment-related coverage; (2) mandated state insurance pools; and (3) general tax credits for health insurance.

        "description":"Public reactions to rape affect victims in a variety of ways and have implications for psychological services and legal adjudication of rape defendants. To investigate reactions to rape, 144 undergraduates were randomly assigned to a 2 (male versus female subjects) x 2 (victim with versus without rape history) x 3 (high versus medium versus low level of victim provocation) between subject design. After reading a fictional police report that manipulated rape history and victim provocation, participants completed a nine-item Rape Questionnaire concerning perceptions of the victim and assailant. The results indicated sex by provocativeness interaction and main effects for all three independent variables. Subjects attributed increasing amounts of blame to the victim as her level of  provocativeness intensified. Victims with a rape history were blamed more than were victims without a rape history. Subject sex was found to influence attributions of blame. Males, more than females, appeared to ascribe to victim's acceptance of blame in proportion to her degree of provocativeness prior to the attack. Females tended to be more empathic toward victims and more accusatory of the assailant than were males. Implications of these sex differences may be significant for the rape victim. To the extent that service providers of each gender differentially ascribe to views about rape, the victim may encounter more initial acceptance from females. (NB)",

To investigate allegations that the Buffalo VA Regional Office was disapproving a high percentage of claims based on PTSD, not processing claims in a timely manner, awarding initial rating levels that were too low, and not providing due process to PTSD claimants, 32 PTSD cases were reviewed. The results revealed that: (1) statistical data on rating levels for PTSD cases were not available; (2) of the 32 cases reviewed, 19 were approved by the Buffalo Office to receive benefits, 4 were granted benefits by the Board of Veterans Appeals, 8 had  been denied by Buffalo and were in the appeals process, and 1 case was denied and closed; (3) the 23 cases receiving benefits had a weighted average rating at the 40-percent degree of disability level and an initial weighted-average rating at the 30-percent level; (4) the Buffalo Office practice for deciding whether to request a psychiatric examination resulted in delay in processing claims; and (5) of 21 decisions rendered by the Board of Veterans Appeals for the 32 cases, none resulted in a return of the case to the Buffalo Office for lack of due process. Corrective actions which Buffalo Office officials have taken or agreed to take should reduce the processing time for PTSD claims. (NB)",

A national survey contrasted 155 persons aged 65 years of age or older with 1100 younger adults in order to identify behavioral and affective differences in health associated with age. In general the elderly were more likely to report poorer health and to be less optimistic about the degree of control possessed over their future health status, although they were significantly more likely to comply with salutary dietary practices than were their young counterparts. They also reported considering these practices as more important and rated their  self-efficacy with respect to effecting them considerably higher. While more compliant with a number of preventive behaviors, the elderly were significantly deficient in certain specific areas such as exercise, having their cholesterol blood levels monitored regularly, participating in medical treatment decisions, and in their knowledge with respect to cancer prevention. It was concluded that these data have the potential to provide a relatively comprehensive picture of the elderly's health seeking experiences and beliefs and to serve as a mechanism by which both strengths and deficits therein are identifiable.

        "description":"Beginning in 1983, a national poll has been conducted annually to assess the extent to which the American public engaged in a core of 21 recommended health seeking behaviors. For the third consecutive year a national sample of approximately 1250 adults were interviewed concerning their self-reported compliance with a basic core of 21 health seeking behaviors. Identical sampling methodologies (i.e., a stratified random digit dialing procedure stratified by geographic region and place of residence therein) and identical behavioral wording were employed across surveys. As reported in 1985, statistically significant changes were observed between the first (1983) and second (1984) years, both with respect to an overall composite score based on all 21 behaviors and for a number of  individual behaviors. Although a numerical improvement was observed for the 1985 composite score as compared to 1984 data, this difference did not reach statistical significance. From an individual perspective, however, two behaviors did register dramatic and statistically significant improvement over the preceding year: respondents reporting always using a seatbelt rose from 27% in 1984 to 41% in 1985 (the comparable figure was only 19% in 1983) and individuals reporting trying very hard to consume adequate amounts of calcium rose from 45% to 57% (65% among women). Overall, these trends continue to be encouraging, although obviously a great deal of room for improvement remains. (Author/NB)",

Questionnaires were completed by 61 male alumni from a school of nursing in a study which attempted to: (1) describe demographic characteristics of respondents; (2) develop reliable measures to test the hypothesis that men pursuing nontraditional careers find relational aspects of their work more important than financial, power, or prestige aspects; (3) compare responses from career and job instructional sets; (4) determine what demographic variables relate to men in nontraditional employment; and (5) identify, through open-ended questions, reasons that men work in  nontraditional careers. The measures were determined to have adequate internal reliability using Chronbach's alpha. A factor analysis supported that the combined scales contained in the measure were responding to two distinct concepts. There was support for the hypothesis that men in the nontraditional role of nursing found the relational aspects of their job more important than the money, power, or prestige. There was little difference between the respondents' view of their career and their specific job. No patterns emerged from the analysis of the demographic data. Responses to the open-ended questions indicated that men in nursing liked relating to patients and peers yet had concerns regarding job security and job satisfaction.

Since Japan's recent technological and economic productivity and growth have been phenomenal, a study was conducted to compare contemporary Japanese men's and women's work related values and beliefs. Work values questionnaires were distributed to over 900 Japanese subjects and t-tests were used to test for differences between men and women. Both Japanese men and women were found to value cooperation among co-workers, to see a need for more leisure time, to feel uneasy when there was no work to be done, and to believe that work should benefit one's country and that education and hard work lead to success. Japanese men were found to believe more strongly than Japanese women that they should be loyal  to their employer, reject offers of higher salaries from other potential employers, stay with the same employer until retirement, sacrifice self for the good of the company, and go to work early and stay late. They also tended to believe more strongly that competition between individuals within the same company is good, that money acquired easily is usually spent unwisely, that people who fail usually have not tried hard enough, and that students should work for good grades out of respect and honor for their parents. Japanese women believed more strongly that use of credit cards leads to careless spending. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Quality circles (QCs) have been considered one of the most promising approaches to improving American workers' productivity. The differences of quality circle effectiveness between active QCs (N=36) and inactive QCs (N=17) in a 3-year period were examined in a quasi-experimental field study. The dependent variables examined were the amount of middle-management involvement, the number of people per quality circle (QC size), the attendance rate at QC meetings, and several measures of their problem-solving activities. The results suggested that active QCs had a significantly higher level of involvement from the middle management than had inactive QCs. Active QCs had more circle members and had a significantly higher attendance rate at QC meetings than had inactive QCs. Further,  active QCs had a significantly lower rate of failure in their problem-solving process than had inactive QCs. It was also found that for active QCs, their QC tenure was negatively correlated with the QC size, and was positively correlated with the number of projects attempted, the number of projects dropped, and the number of projects completed. For inactive QCs, the attendance rate at AC meetings was negatively correlated with the number of projects completed and their QC tenure was negatively correlated with the rate of failure.

        "description":"Student evaluation of professors is increasingly accepted as a normal part of higher education. To examine whether students' involvements and participation in an instructional setting would be positively correlated with their evaluations of faculty performance, 66 college students were given a Likert type rating scale to rate their own behaviors in an instructional setting and to evaluate faculty performance. Eight dimensions of the instructor's performance were rated: (1) knowledge of subject matter; (2) ability to answer student questions; (3) ability to explain, demonstrate, and present material clearly; (4) ability to stimulate student interest; (5) willingness to talk with students outside of class; (6) clarity of course requirements; (7) clarity of grading criteria; and (8)  knowledge gained by student in class. Correlations among student behaviors and faculty performance ratings were examined. The results showed that students' self-reported behaviors in an instructional setting were significantly correlated with their faculty evaluations. Further, 33 out of 36 intercorrelations among the eight dimensions of the instructor's performance reached significance, suggesting a strong halo effect in students' evaluations. The present results supported the notion that ratings may give a better indication of a rater's schemata than they do a ratee's actual level of performance. (NB)",

The results showed that the interaction between Leisure Ethic endorsement and task label was significant among Type A coronary-prone subjects, but was not significant among Type B subjects. Reported in this document is a study conducted to replicate the 1984 study, using a sample of university students (N=58) in Taiwan, Republic of China. Chinese college students were classified as either Type A or Type B, and as either high or low Leisure Ethic, based on the median-split in their scores on Type A and Leisure Ethic measures. The results suggested that high  Leisure Ethic subjects had significantly higher reported frequencies of going to movies and live concerts than had low Leisure Ethic subjects. Type As had a significantly higher rate of going to live concerts than had Type Bs. Type As with a high Leisure Ethic endorsement attended more live concerts than the average of the other three groups. Type As with a low Leisure Ethic had a significantly better total academic performance than the average of the other three groups. For Type Bs, the results failed to reach significance. The results of Tang and Baumeister's 1984 study were replicated in the present study. (NB)",

        "description":"Historically, when aging adults could no longer negotiate the difficulties of living alone, they faced either institutionalization or living with their children. Shared housing may be a viable third option for many aging homeowners. The University of Utah's Intermountain West Long Term Care Gerontology Center developed the Senior/Student Shared Housing Program, a model shared housing project matching older adults with college students. Students provide maintenance and chore services for the older homeowner in exchange for their room or their room and board. Since the first senior/student match was made in 1984, 82 matches have been made and 20 are currently functioning well. This paper describes the project, how contracts between seniors and students are made, and what forms and  questionnaires are used. Listed are six benefits gained by the senior through the project, five benefits for students, six drawbacks for seniors, and seven drawbacks for students. Additional results on the program's effectiveness are presented from three sources of data: (1) questionnaire forms completed by seniors and students at the time of application; (2) a follow-up evaluation conducted 2 to 3 months into the match; and (3) a final termination assessment at completion. Twelve data tables are included. (NB)",

Research is reviewed which has identified characteristics of dropouts and their reasons for leaving school. Other studies are cited which explore characteristics of effective dropout prevention programs in schools. Individual programs are briefly described and elements of the more successful programs are summarized. It is concluded that: (1) programs should be student-centered; (2) programs should be started as early as possible and should involve families as much as possible; (3) staff selection and training is paramount; and (4) programs should include attention to overall school climate and effective school development. The  information and conclusions presented in the monograph are used to create a series of nine recommendations and guidelines for designing, planning, and implementing dropout prevention programs.

The evolution of the concepts of career and career development are reviewed and the rethinking and reformulating of these concepts that have occurred since 1900 are examined. The time period from 1900 to 1950 is reviewed as the formative years; the time from 1950 to 1980 as the transition years; and the time from 1980 and beyond as current formulations. Areas discussed include the industrial revolution, social protest and reform, vocational guidance, vocational development, career, and career development. The impact on counselors of this evolution of career development is discussed. The second half of this monograph looks at the career counseling process and  discusses how the broader meanings of career and career development that have evolved over the years impact the career counseling process and its use. The document provides a framework of six possible phases of career counseling: (1) establishing the client-counselor relationship and responsibilities; (2) gathering client self-information and environmental information; (3) understanding client information; (4) drawing conclusions and making diagnoses; (5) taking action; and (6) evaluating the impact of intervention. The use of the Life Career Assessment to gather client information is explained. (NB)",

First, comparisons of intact groups are often used as a basis for making causal inferences about how observed characteristics affect behaviors. While comparing different groups is not by itself a useless activity, progressing directly to training is premature at best. Second, the think-aloud protocol technique is often used for inferring a subject's cognitive structure of subject matter. This method is inappropriate because it assumes that the organization of this structure resides consciously in a person's mind and can be verbally reproduced. Third, retrospective methods have been employed to infer causality by selecting groups currently differing  and discovering differences in their past on putative causal variables, which are then inferred to have caused the present differences. While this technique must be used in historical analyses, it becomes suspect when the inferences are used to speculate on implications for current practice. Finally, techniques employed in naturalistic inquiry often confuse a change in methodology with a change in the discipline being studied, and rely heavily on impressionistic, one-shot observation for many facts.

This  section concludes with a discussion of the findings of the studies, which suggest that the subjects, high school students, need to develop efficient techniques for mapping referents. Studies described in the second section address the transfer of skill developed in using context for accessing concepts to the performance of high level comprehension tasks, and the use of component-based training for improving reading skills of low ability readers whose first language is not the language of instruction. The findings reported in this section suggest that bilingual students can benefit from computer-based training focusing on the development of automatic skills for both decoding and encoding orthographic information.

Subjects were 92 third-grade students from three different schools, equally divided into control and experimental groups. Students in the experimental group received regular reading instruction with the addition of 27 instructional cloze lessons. Students in the control group received regular reading instruction with work in reading centers in lieu of the cloze instruction. A Quasi-Cloze Divergent  Production Test was used as pretest and posttest. Results indicated that the divergent production of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group.

        "description":"To explore how instruction in questioning can enhance teachers' use of questions that promote comprehension and how teachers' instruction of students in such strategies can enhance their ability to comprehend content area texts independently, this paper looks at prereading, during-reading, and postreading questioning activities. The first major section of the paper discusses two kinds of conceptual knowledge involved in the comprehension of expository prose: text structure knowledge and knowledge of text processing strategies. The second section of the paper looks at the kinds of questioning strategies that have been effective in developing students' comprehension of expository text. Specifically, it uses a reading lesson as a framework for discussing questions used in the  prereading, during-reading, and postreading stages of the lesson. The third section of the paper examines the instructional methods that contribute to students' independent use of questioning strategies: (1) direct explanation and modeling, (2) guided practice, and (3) question answer relationships. The paper concludes by noting that the quantity of research focusing on questioning underscores the pervasiveness of questioning strategies in the classroom.

The miscue analysis led to the identification of text features readers use to assign pronoun reference, the strategies developing readers often employ, and the patterns of correction of pronoun miscues. Specifically, it indicated that young readers used certain text features and consistent strategies to assign reference. In cases where text features aided prediction, the readers did particularly well. Even when they made miscues on pronouns, they frequently were able to correct them when the text did not confirm their original choice. (FL)",

Attributional style and metacognitive strategies exhibited while reading college text material were assessed for 75 probationary students of average reading ability. First, however, an attributional styles questionnaire and a metacognitive behavior scale had to be developed. Although findings revealed no statistically significant relationship between the two variables, they did show a tendency for subjects marked \"low\" on metacognitive reading behaviors to be rated \"external\" and \"internal\" in attributional styles at  approximately 1.5 times the expected rate (i.e., to score in the top or bottom 10% on the attributional styles questionnaire). In addition, results indicated that subjects demonstrated significantly fewer metacognitive reading behaviors and exhibited more extremely external attributors than the regularly enrolled population.

A review of research related to these behaviors and to corresponding spelling behaviors suggests a number of implications for instruction, including the following: (1) disfluent oral readers may need to point as they read, but silent readers should not need to point because they have sufficient oral fluency; (2) reading in groups should be oral for beginning readers; (3) reading rate is a reliable and easily obtained indicator of fluency and is closely related to reading accuracy; and (4) diagnostic teaching should include a sampling of invented spellings and an analysis of the synchrony  between stages of reading and spelling. Both fluency and expression can be promoted through the use of relatively easy material. (FL)",

The analysis focused on writers' attitudes toward computer tutors in the invention process. Data were collected by tape recording a single college freshman as she acquainted herself with word processing and computer tutors. The student was asked to verbalize everything she was thinking, whether or not she thought it was relevant. This resulted in a record of the entire writing process, from generating ideas to processing lower-order concerns, such as spelling and proper keystrokes. Analysis of the protocols revealed that she seemed to be engaged by the interactive  invention program but never indicated that she thought the computer was intelligent or possessed of human qualities. Although the subject was aware of the on-line help feature, she never took advantage of it, seeming content to use the word processing program as a glorified typewriter and missing out on the chance to revise and edit using features such as cut-and-paste or search-and-replace. Her reluctance to use these special programs represents general student attitudes, indicating students still are not convinced their writing could benefit from these computer tutors.

The procedure consists of a series of strategies to facilitate the instructional process, as follows: (1) as a warm-up mechanism, the teacher introduces the writing skill (i.e., information or persuasion) on an overhead projector; (2) students are allowed time for questions and comments; (3) the news segment is presented; (4) students produce an outline from the news stimulus; (5) outlines are then assessed for organization; (6) the outlines are collected to minimize any external influences; and (7) students produce a full length essay at the next class period, after receiving their  outlines. Topics should include an introduction, adequate support, and argumentation. Provision should be made for revision, and both formal (e.g., progressive scales) and informal mechanisms can be used for evaluating these writing activities. Since the structure and content of television news and documentary presentations seem to mirror the practice of essay writing instruction, the incorporation of such programs may be a productive avenue of writing instruction.

Only seven of them had used computers in their classrooms and most of the seven stressed that they did not use them for teaching. Furthermore, most lacked confidence both as writers and as teachers of writing. They maintained daily writing process logs, and after only a few days, most were comfortable with the word processing program. Each teacher completed an individual project, and many planned ways to use word processing and computers in other aspects of their professional lives. Six months later, eleven of the teachers responded to a follow-up  questionnaire, which indicated that eight were teaching writing more than they had before the course, many were using an expanded repertoire of writing activities, and a few were even conducting computer-use workshops for their colleagues. Most of the teachers had incorporated word processing into their own writing with half of them using it to teach writing, although lack of software and hardware, funding, and computer-to-student ratios were identified as common problems.

The first axis in the model, the focus continuum, characterizes how the tutor interacts with the writer and text based on person-centered, process-centered, text-centered, and/or rule-governed approaches. This continuum incorporates the views of those advocating mechanical competence, style, and writing as an individual process. The second axis locates the tutorial process along the attitudinal continuum, a perspective based on: pedagogical style, logic, and/or instinct.  Together, these two axes comprise the focus of the tutoring situation. The third axis, the interactional continuum, describes the relationship that occurs during the peer tutoring process and is based on the following conversational modes: authoritarian, conversant (collaborative), and/or receiver (student centered). Overall, this three-dimensional model characterizes 36 basic tutoring types which allow for an infinite amount of variation. By identifying locations along the continua as a point of departure, researchers can use the model to designate roles, differentiate between concepts that address only one or two facets of tutoring, and eventually offer a new heuristic for training peer tutors.

At the end of the year, all of the journal entries for the 20 children in the class were studied and placed into ten categories: (1) pictures only, (2) scribble and/or random letters, (3) labels or descriptions of pictures, (4) lists, (5) copies of texts, (6) retelling of texts, (7) personal content, (8) imaginative content, (9) informational content, and (10) other written forms such as puzzles. Regardless of the children's writing levels, all were confident of their writing  abilities. They varied in capability and in selection of topics, though some common writing behaviors were noted. Informational content accounted for 28.4% of journal entries, personal experiences for 36.6%, and information about holidays for 11.9%. A given student's entries were not always at a consistent level, but researchers interpreted the variance as part of normal writing development.

        "description":"The use of children's literature in the classroom can greatly enhance the core curriculum by supporting children's cognition, language, personality, social, aesthetic, and creative development. Preservice teachers often have difficulty conceptualizing a style of literature presentation that will provide optimum learning-stimulation, however, and the EXCEL (Expanding Children's Experiences through Literature) approach was conceived in response to this need. This three-pronged approach is aimed at drawing upon and expanding children's experiences, increasing students' interactions with oral and written language, and developing students' interests in literature while actively engaging them in literature experiences. The steps involved in EXCEL are (1) a prereading activity; (2) the  reading, telling, or dramatization of a story; and (3) a postreading activity. EXCEL has proven very effective with children from preschool age through sixth grade and with normal as well as exceptional and multicultural populations. If children are to discover the joy of involvement in the world of books, it is important to make maximal use of their literature experiences. Only after finding excitement in books can children be expected to become more than nominally involved in reading. (AEW)",

The headquarters staff at the National Council of Teachers of English, in cooperation with its Standing Committee on Affiliates, has been developing materials to launch public relations efforts on issues that affect the teaching of English.

Cognoter improves on current invention aids by combining a brainstorming tool, a graphical linking tool, and an outlining tool. An aid designed for use by groups to further the collaborative development of presentations, Cognoter can also suggest new heuristics that might become the basis for invention aids. While not explicitly oriented to supporting inventional activities, CB software essentially allows users to send each other messages in real time via a network. CB's social, conversation-based approach offers several potential benefits for  invention pedagogy: (1) it provides a naturalistic setting for introducing formalized heuristics; (2) with the teachers online, the use of more advanced techniques can be demonstrated in context; and (3) new heuristics could grow out of online conversations. Collaborative tools such as Cognoter and CB may make inventional activities more explicit, and may also reveal that the inventional behavior of groups is different from that of an individual. However, researchers must be careful in interpreting the large body of data generated by these collaborative invention tools. (JD)",

Being editor of such a journal requires a working knowledge of production, layout, and design, besides handling other routine duties like correspondence and reading manuscripts. The editor also sets and maintains the journal's tone, being careful not to let his or her personal voice become prominent. &quot;RR&quot; owes much of its success to its editorial board and referees--each article goes through at least five readers before it is published, and each author receives a personal letter from the editor if his or her manuscript is accepted or rejected. As a reader's rather than an editor's publication, &quot;RR&quot; does not  encourage articles that are (1) encyclopedia rewrites, (2) superficial approaches to a subject, (3) obvious topics, (4) answering questions no one is asking, (5) banal in &quot;voice,&quot; and (6) research reports rather than articles based on research. Although &quot;RR&quot; has avoided being formulaic, it seems to reflect the tone of composition studies more than any other composition journal, probably because each issue includes a variety of articles with various voices, while retaining the language of the humanities. Each issue of a journal like &quot;RR&quot; is an unanticipated community where writers meet one another and their readers. (NKA)",

The phrase &quot;rhetorical exigency&quot; was first used by Lloyd Bitzer in his essay &quot;The Rhetorical Situation,&quot; but he defined it too narrowly to account for academic discourse. Bitzer's effort to limit rhetorical discourse and distinguish it from other types requires an &quot;exigency&quot; of such objective and intrinsic power that its practical, classroom use as a theoretical concept is severely compromised: his examples are all crisis situations, such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor or  the fall of Nikita Khrushchev. He also addresses a second exigency experienced by rhetoricians in speech communication: the need to establish a perspective for rhetorical criticism as distinct from other types, notably literary criticism. Rhetorical exigency as applied to freshman composition is problematic, but perhaps the need for doubt (about conventional wisdom, for example) is one instance of master exigency that could introduce writing students to membership in the academic community.

However, most programs share the same weaknesses: a linear and judgmental composition philosophy and an inappropriate revision model. A combination of Writer's Workbench and Emacs (a Microsoft \"word\" type of environment that has allowed for creation of a word processor through flexible use of the VT220 keyboard) results in a technology that encourages  style and usage revision at any stage of the student's composing process. For example, a student can view simultaneously the text being edited and a Writer's Workbench text analysis. This program can also be used as an instructional tool by writing a script with blank spaces for inserting variables taken from the program's statistical text analysis. The resulting feedback, specific to the assignment's rhetorical mode of an assignment and combined with the computer software technology, encourages both deep structure and surface feature revisions.

One such example was a former pupil in Hong Kong struggling to make her students memorize a poem called &quot;London Snow&quot; (&quot;snow&quot; is an abstract concept in Hong Kong) so that they could win a contest to be judged by the British, homesick for snowy England. In Georgia, the professor was asked to revise student compositions in ungrammatical but forceful black English for a school newspaper while the students played for three weeks. Impressing the administration was a necessity, rather than teaching the students how to revise for themselves. In London, poor inner city students insisted on the superior  qualities of the Rolls Royce or Jaguar over the Cadillac, even though they rarely got to ride in cars of any kind--their patriotism served so easily to divert them from more important lessons. The final irony occurred in rural China where the Chinese and Americans have a joint venture in a new hotel. The Chinese government hired the persons who spoke the best English, not those who were the best qualified as cooks, servers, or problem solvers. Based on these experiences, the professor has come to equate the idea of literacy not with a set of skills to be learned but rather with a certain behavior to be achieved: passive obedience to authority.

Data for an analysis of black adult students' writing at the syntactic level have shown that problems of clarity might be related to language structure and use in the students' speech community. Samples of students' writing were taken from essays obtained at an urban community college, and considering the cultural dimensions of a writer's background proved helpful in determining the reasons for certain lexical choices. To facilitate the analysis, a general topic and a variable from each sentence were extricated (since they were manifestations of ideas  which were expressed through the written word, the topic and variables were usually found together). Researchers hoped to determine (1) whether specific issues were evident in the writers' samples, and (2) if so, whether these sociolinguistic variables were apt to influence these issues. This has proved to be the case insofar as the samples in this study were concerned, thus supporting the view that studies of language cannot be carried out in a \"narrowly defined view of grammar.\" (Sample sentences and their extensive analysis are included.)

To help make people more employable in the rising service economy universities have abandoned literature for the skill-oriented classroom, thus fostering an attack on critical thinking at the very moment that critical thought is most needed. Rather than the manufactured split between literature and composition, it is the &quot;technicization&quot; of education that divides the various university camps. Today, literacy means the ability to adjust to an economy that demands nothing but simple communication to further efficient roles.  Current composition programs and &quot;computer literacy&quot; programs are simply more of the same factory service programs designed a century ago to retrain someone to fit efficiently back into a job that may again be eliminated. The pure composition class is a logical extension of technology because it socializes the writer and helps him or her consume, while literature disrupts the purposes of technology, allowing the reader to see beneath the smooth surface of technical functions. If literature cannot be included in composition class, then other approaches can be used, such as (1) a reader or anthology that offers complex ideas, (2) emphasis on the argument paper, (3) helping students feel the &quot;slow pace&quot; of critical thought, and (4) a long hard look at how economies are structuring society.

Under the &quot;old pedagogy,&quot; correctness is valued over content, revision is approached as cosmetic change, formulaic rhetorical modes are taught before students set pen to paper, and the lecture is still the favorite instructional method. When teachers base their composition courses on what students will have to know to graduate or to enter other courses, they are saying that composition amounts to a university service course, that it is a primer for correctness. Instead of seeing student errors as a natural step in the process of learning to write, these teachers equate mistakes with lack of progress and, moreover, they fail to come to terms  with the unsettled, transitory nature of language and writing. Composition teachers who view their discipline as a grammar or service course allow the curriculum to be set by members of other departments. On the other hand, composition teachers who create an environment in which students can write and respond to each other's writing, serve their students well. Consideration of cognitive development when determining composition curriculum is also within the student's best interest. The criteria the new rhetoricians have for effective student writing are different from those of past generations and, by challenging that past, process-oriented composition, teachers can make their own new, pertinent, and powerful history.

An examination of the scholarly writing in composition and rhetoric research shows a division between formative or process evaluation and summative or product evaluation, with advocates for each side. As readers, composition instructors attempt to construct students' texts--projecting on to those texts expectations, knowledge of codes, and normative beliefs regarding texts. Freire advocates that the evaluator and the learner join in evaluation, thus establishing distance from the work under consideration and achieving one of the central goals of education--demystification of inherently ideological codes. Freire's ideas were tested in writing workshops, with  several important benefits: (1) evaluation became a dialogue between writers and readers, wherein reading and writing were viewed as cogenerative activities; (2) commentators never wrote directly on the students' papers, leaving the writers with authority over their texts--a dialogical model; (3) after each reader protocol session, reader expectations became clearer; and (4) reader protocols allowed the evaluator to render some particular biases less opaque and more open to question by the students. Studies show that such evaluation could eventually be viewed as a dialectical process, a transactional event between students and teachers (readers and writers), and an exploration of summative criteria as a formative process.

The study sought to determine if there was a noticeable improvement in the writing skills of students studying with the teacher-researchers as opposed to students studying with nonparticipants. All teachers had their students complete two pieces of timed writing on topics previously proved successful in the district. The holistic method, through which readers are encouraged to view a piece of writing as more than the mere sum of its parts, was used to assess the papers. Considered as a group, writing samples submitted by students of teacher-researchers showed an improvement in average scores. In five of the six  grades evaluated, the writing of teacher-researchers' students showed greater improvement than did the writing of the comparison group, but the writing of the comparison group students showed improvement in only two of the six grade levels.

They read only the most utilitarian texts--appliance instructions or road signs, for example. A teacher cannot &quot;make&quot; students read anything, but he or she can help them find ways to like reading; one goal of a teacher should be to help students take responsibility for their own learning. Three general suggestions can be incorporated into writing classes to turn students into self-motivated readers: (1) help them recognize and question the speaker in the text; (2) persuade them to respond to books just as they respond to each other's writing--by commenting in the margins and by underlining words they find interesting or confusing to return to  later; and (3) introduce them to non-traditional texts (such as Maya Angelou's &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;). No other class is as small and flexible as the composition class, where students have an opportunity to write at length about their reading reactions, questions, and discoveries. The teacher can help these non-readers discover that the world of books belongs to them too. (NKA)",

Josephine Turck Baker, editor and founder, understood that conventions of grammar arose from usage. It was her opinion that correctness was determined by clarity, not by the rules of Latin syntax. Thus, &quot;correct&quot; usage was defined as the careful selection of words that accurately communicated a thought or idea. Among the consequences of this instrumental view of language were (1) a preoccupation with vocabulary acquisition; (2) encouragement of students to &quot;think first, then write&quot; (an injunction central to the theory now known as Current-Traditional rhetoric); and (3) reduction of written composition to a purely mental exercise, with the teacher's role  becoming one of exhortation in abstract principles. Baker was also convinced that literature should be taught only after students had mastered grammar and spelling, since literature was art, which she defined as the mastery of abstract rules. &quot;Correct English&quot; ceased publication when its editorial staff and writers became confident that universal literacy could be achieved through progressive educational policies and technology. The notion of language as an instrument or &quot;tool of communication&quot; has endured, even in university English departments. (AEW)",

        "description":"The cognitivist view of composition suggests that if students are supplied with a set of writing strategies, they will learn to think in more complex and powerful ways, observing their own ideas and writing from another person's viewpoint. On the other hand, some social critics argue that composition teachers need to help their students enter into a new sort of discourse--one that &quot;invents the university...to try on the peculiar ways of knowing, selecting, evaluating, reporting, concluding, and arguing that define the discourse of our community&quot; (Bartholomae). In her book, &quot;Problem-Solving Strategies for Writing,&quot; Linda Flower offers two examples of student writing--the first one termed egocentric and writer-based and the other firm and authoritative. The second example, advanced  as better from a reader or professor's viewpoint, in fact shows the writer being socialized and appropriated by the academy. Flower's use of the word &quot;egocentric&quot; for the first example is dismissive, implying that the writer has failed to master the rudiments of ordinary adult discourse, when the real problem is how to enter into a discourse whose constraints and phrasings are unfamiliar to her. Flower's reader-based prose is really another name for a privileged form of discourse: hierarchical in structure, organized around concepts rather than events, and whose transitions and conclusions are made strongly explicit. What is needed instead is a way of talking about writing that does not turn into yet another language of exclusion but rather allows students to connect their discourses to  others'. (NKA)",

It is when they take the bar examination or actually begin to work in a law office that they need the faculty of analytical thinking, for notes must be organized into a cogent argument. Most attorneys need special facility with four cognitive processes: applying law to facts, analogizing cases, drawing inferences, and focusing abstract concepts. The ideal place to teach these critical thinking skills is in legal writing classes, where written discourse offers the best opportunity for correcting deficiencies and refining skills in using critical cognitive processes. Strategies for teaching critical  thinking in legal writing seminars include the following: (1) attach the writing class to a substantive law course, (2) focus primarily on organization at a variety of levels, (3) encourage the students to make their organization visible, (4) pay more attention to the effect of the prose on the reader than to the writing process, and (5) insist on multiple revisions. Legal writing combines some elements of freshman composition, literary criticism, and technical writing but depends strongly on reasoning abilities that law students have had little opportunity to develop.

Some of the questions included: (1) How detailed must an assignment be to communicate its goals? (2) What type of detail is needed? (3) To which sections of assignments do students pay the most attention? (4) How much difference does audience, purpose, or mode make on students' writing? and (5) How can teachers be sure that they, themselves, fully recognize the purpose of a particular writing assignment? Researchers have found that assignments asking for less challenging modes of discourse, such as relating ideas, did not produce better or worse essays  than did assignments asking for more challenging modes of discourse, such as evaluating ideas. Students have been known to center their attention on phrases or sentences in a writing assignment that teachers may have provided as background information, rather than on salient parts of the assignment. Researchers have also noted that people learned to write because they had to: when they had something to write about, when the need for writing was immediate, and when they had an audience they knew needed the communication. This observation may lay the foundation for further research into improving the clarity of writing assignments. (A list of works on writing assignments is included.) (AEW)",

MacLeish considered radio the ideal medium for poetry because it offers only aural stimuli without competition from visual stimuli. In &quot;The Fall of the City&quot; a conqueror arrives and the people of the city fall at his feet, but when he lifts the visor on his helmet, there is no one inside the armor. The radio announcer, acting in the tradition of the Greek chorus, states the theme of the drama: people invent their oppressors. The part of the announcer was played by Orson Welles. Crowd noises were created by recording the sounds of students and extras earlier  and playing it back during the live performance while the extras repeated their noise. &quot;The Fall of the City&quot; was a significant event because it was prophetic of events to come, such as the fall of Vienna to Hitler, and also because it represented the first attempt by an American poet to create a verse play expressly for radio. In general, &quot;The Fall of the City&quot; met with public acceptance and critical acclaim. (SRT)",

Subjects, 179 undergraduate intercultural communication students at a large midwestern university, and with varying degrees of intercultural experience (none; less than three months; and 3-12 months) completed an 18-item questionnaire measuring various cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of intercultural competence. The questionnaire dealt with four general areas of intercultural competence, drawn from previous literature. Results identified most clearly the cognitive and affective aspects of intercultural competence, less clearly the behavioral. Concerning the primary research question--the relationship  between intercultural competence and previous sojourn experience--results suggest that the duration of the intercultural sojourn is related to self-reported competence in two cognitive dimensions: Awareness of Self and Culture, and the Ability to Facilitate Communication. These findings are consistent with previous research investigating outcomes of intercultural sojourns. (Data tables and an extensive bibliography are appended.) (NKA)",

        "description":"Followers attribute authority to charismatic leaders through their faith and belief in them and in their mission. Charismatic authority in organizations involves an interaction of leader, followers, and moral order; in the eyes of the followers, the leader personifies that order. Authority must come from below because the ultimate decision to cooperate rests with the employee. True charismatic leaders are able to place themselves and their mission beyond the realm of the ordinary and thus extract extraordinary effort, dedication, and faith from followers. These leaders are persuasive through the use of a modified enthymeme, one that adapts the audience to itself rather than adapting itself to the audience. Charismatic leadership effects its rhetorical appeal as much through the  leader's persona as through the rational force of logical form. The ancient Roman concept of &quot;vir bonus&quot; or &quot;good man&quot; was extrinsic to the speaking situation; it was an accumulated perception based on a record of civil service. The Roman orator appearing to have strong moral character was able to persuade on the basis of this &quot;good man&quot; status. Similarly, the charismatic organizational leader embodies the aspirations and values of the organization, and with his or her character provides the persuasion that elicits obedience and commitment. This rhetorical perspective should facilitate critical analysis of the ethics at work in contemporary organizational culture. (SRT)",

        "description":"An examination of letters left at the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial in Washington, D.C. between November, 1984 and April, 1986 revealed that the memorial serves as a rhetorical situation that urges its visitors to eloquence. The memorial is an excellent proving ground for situational theory because the interaction of site and perception is vital to the communication created by the rhetor/audience. The memorial consists of two walls of granite in a v-shape, inscribed with the names of those who died in the Vietnam War. Those who leave messages at the memorial treat it as a commemoration, a gravesite, a spiritual medium, and an apology to the dead. The motivation behind visitors' responses seems to be a search for healing; each rhetor is searching for some form of peace. Visitors are  moved to eulogize the dead in ways that personalize the memorial. The messages left behind suggest that for many, visiting the memorial is cathartic. And for some, the messages and the memorial serve as a medium for speaking to the dead. Finally, visitors use their messages to apologize for being alive when a friend is dead. The responses arise from each visitor's subjective needs, but the memorial serves as a rhetorical situation transforming these internal responses into rhetoric. (SRT)",

Richards has a significant contribution to make to the continuing dialogue regarding communication and values, this paper examines Richards' thinking concerning the communication-values relationship. The paper notes that the neglect of Richards' work by communication theorists is due largely to a misunderstanding of his perspective--often seen as a narrow positivism holding that values and communication are separate. A reanalysis is proposed, based on the view that Richards was an axiologically oriented theorist concerned with links among choices, values, and communication. The analysis proceeds in three steps: (1) an outline of Richards' theory of value, which synthesizes ideas found in a number of works; (2) a discussion that relates his  theory of values to his ideas regarding communication, especially as they appear in his &quot;theory of comprehending&quot; and the associated idea of &quot;feedforward&quot;; and (3) a demonstration of the practical utility of the analysis, conducted by looking at the research on compliance and compliance-gaining, to show how Richards' scheme for understanding the communication-value relationship can inform contemporary communication scholarship.

        "description":"Three studies explored the impact of the controversial television docudrama &quot;Death of a Princess&quot; on viewers' attitudes, comprehension, and desire to continue viewing the film. Sixty students in undergraduate communication classes participated in Study I, which measured attitude change induced by the film, relative to the viewers' prior knowledge base. A different group of 60 communication undergraduates took part in Study II, in which the same procedures were used, but attitude change relative to the viewers' level of religiosity was measured. Study III used a third group, 40 undergraduates enrolled, as were the others, in communication classes, to examine attitude change relative to personal evaluation of two concepts: &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot; and &quot;Moslem.&quot; Each group was divided equally  into those who reviewed the film and those who did not. Although it was hypothesized that viewing the docudrama would induce a more negative attitude toward Saudi Arabia, results indicated that a sweeping attitude change did not occur. Contrary to findings of previous research, men were found to be more persuadable than women. In addition, the control group developed a more positive attitude toward Saudi Arabia, while the group that actually viewed the film showed negative tendencies. Plausible explanations include: an inappropriate level of complexity for intercultural communication, differing conceptual schemes between groups, and previous exposure to media cultural bias. Overall, results suggest that the Saudi government's protest and the general international concern prior to the  airing of the docudrama were unwarranted. (Data tables are appended.) (Author/NKA)",

Subjects, 120 college students, completed the Interaction Involvement Scale and were placed in same-sex dyads of three types: (1) mixed dyads of one high- and one low-involved subject; (2) same-level dyads composed of two high-involved subjects; or (3) same-level dyads composed of two low-involved subjects. Each dyad was videotaped as it engaged in a negotiation scenario. The transcripts were then coded for type of negotiation strategy used--assertions, argument assertions, refutations, countersupport statements, statements of blame, and other strategies. Results showed that subjects who were higher in interaction involvement  used a significantly different negotiation strategy than subjects who were lower in involvement. Specifically, the high-involved subjects used a more thoughtful, reasoned, and persuasive negotiating style than did low-involved subjects. Results indicate, however, that high involvement was not an advantage in negotiation; in fact, results suggest the highest levels of involvement might actually have inhibited the negotiator's chances for success.

It was hypothesized that: (1) the linear combination of biological sex type of subject and subjects perception of mother (psychological scores) would significantly predict self-disclosure scores to an individual's mother, and (2) the linear combination of biological sex type and perception of father (psychological score) would significantly predict self-disclosure scores to an individual's father. Subjects, 184 undergraduate students, completed two scales, Jourard's Self-Disclosure Scale (JSDQ 60) and the revised Bem's Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI), in response to a target parent, either father or mother. Results suggest  that a two-variable predictive model of disclosure to parents can be developed based on biological sex of subject and perceived psychological sex typing of the parent. In Model 1, biological sex of the discloser and both feminine and masculine traits of the mother accounted for some of the variance in self-disclosure scores, indicating that biological sex is influential in disclosure to the mother. Findings for Model 2 indicate that the perceived psychological sex type of the father accounted for a quarter of the variance in self-disclosure scores, suggesting that biological sex does not significantly influence disclosure to an individual's father. Although biological and perceived psychological sex typing cannot account for 100% of the variance in self-disclosure scores, the present  study demonstrates a statistically significant theoretical relationship to self-disclosure actually experienced in communication between parent and child.

Hoge drew upon the historical legacy of the American Revolution to suggest that the colonies had also formed a separate government and &quot;seceded&quot; from Great Britain. According to Hoge, the Constitution not only guaranteed the privilege of secession, but that the salvation of such a holy document demanded the region go to war. Furthermore, he maintained, the justification for the South's entry into civil conflict was a result of its efforts to preserve the principles upon which American political theory was founded. Hoge predicted that the loss of the  Constitution, through Northern subversion, would have an impact on the entire nation, and to forestall a state of national emergency, he implored the North to return to a strict reading of the Constitution. Since the South alone possessed the essence of the Constitution, the region could lead the way back to its principles, providing a redemption for the country. But this process had to begin with northern recognition of its constitutional abuses. In light of such postwar rhetorical defiance, the South's separateness for at least a century after Appomattox is more easily understood. (AEW)",

        "author":["Byers, Peggy Yuhas"],
        "description":"Kenneth Burke's dramatistic theory of social movements can be applied to current romantic jealousy theories. Burke's dramaturgy has seven major elements: order, guilt, negation, victimage, mortification, catharsis, and redemption. These elements may all be transposed onto Burke's three critical motives: Order (status quo), Secret (differences between partners), and Kill (changing the old order for a new one). The dyadic relationship required for romantic jealousy to occur creates an order for itself comparable to orders in society. Negation occurs when one partner in a dyad deviates from the other's definition of how the relationship should be. Guilt can occur either before or after the negation. The guilt preceding negation is usually felt by the one who has broken the order.  Guilt is experienced by the jealous partner after negation because that person feels he or she has done something wrong. Victimage is similar to scapegoating. Freud believed that one expiates the guilt of infidelity by projecting it onto the partner, or scapegoat. Victimage has been documented in which the jealous partner has attempted to punish either the rival or the romantic partner. Mortification is another means of expiating guilt, but places the blame on oneself. Mortification has also been documented involving victimage of the self, or suicide. The aspects of redemption and catharsis, in which the guilt is resolved and a new order is obtained, are only implicitly explored in the literature on romantic jealousy. (SRT)",

        "description":"In Japan, absolute social status and power relationships among people are clearer than in the United States. The Japanese language supports this social system with the use of a special polite language (&quot;keigo&quot;), structural use of which is the same as polite language in English. The differences lie in the degrees of familiarity used and in the complexity of the relationship between speakers, as well as in interpretations of the relationship. For example, in a request, if the listener is superior to the speaker, the Japanese tend to acknowledge that superiority more, using more negative politeness (the kind that minimizes imposition) than do Americans. In English, inviting others into a group by use of informal language is polite, whereas in Japanese keeping others outside the  group is the polite form of behavior. Thus, Americans tend to use more positive politeness (the kind that satisfies the speaker's need for approval) than Japanese do, and Japanese usually use negative politeness to those outside the group. When researchers surveyed native speakers of American English and nonnative English as a Second Language (ESL) learners on their perceptions of degrees of politeness, results indicated that mood contributes most to the politeness hierarchy, in this order: interrogative- most polite, declarative--next most polite, and imperative--least polite. (A set of 14 hypotheses to test politeness strategies in English is included and offered for testing.) (NKA)",

        "description":"The idea that mass communication effects may decrease diversity among people or societies exposed to it arises constantly. However, discussions of mass media effects do not highlight differences between mass communications that &quot;affect&quot; people uniformly and messages that members of audiences &quot;respond to&quot; in similar ways. A number of modern theories concerning the effects of mass communication explicitly predict, or at least imply, homogenizing effects. The &quot;mainstreaming&quot; concept hypothesizes that television &quot;cultivates&quot; in heavy viewers an image of the world similar to that shown on the screen. A refinement of the global cultivation hypothesis, &quot;resonance,&quot; is said to occur in instances where specific issues have particular salience to people's everyday reality (or even  perceived reality) and the combination resonates and amplifies cultivation. In most instances, resonance increases differences between or among social groups. Even though theoretical ideas concerning the influence of mass communication upon stereotyping, public opinion and culture imply uniform audience responses, the literature contains almost no examples of methods designed to test hypotheses about the uniformity of individual responses. People within a society will not necessarily be more homogeneous following the introduction of some form of media content, even if the content contributes to uniformity among the individuals exposed to it.

Subjects responded to a rhetorical sensitivity scale (RHETSEN) to determine their communication style: noble self, rhetorically sensitive, and rhetorical reflector. The persuasive style of the noble self can be characterized as straightforward and direct; the goal is to gain power in the situation and use that power to push for compliance. The rhetorically sensitive person is concerned about relationships with others and makes situationally adaptive choices. Rhetorical reflectors have been characterized as wanting to fulfill persuasive objectives through the satisfaction of the needs of the other person. Drawing on a set of 858 dialogues written by college students enrolled in speech  communication classes, the project analyzed the dialogues written by the 161 subjects who identified exclusively with one of the three styles. The dialogue writers responded to one of six different persuasive situations defined by levels of intimacy and power. Results indicated that the strategies of guilt and allurement distinguished rhetorical sensitives from noble selves and that altruism and aversive stimulation distinguished rhetorical reflectors from noble selves and rhetorical sensitives. The results provide insight into how orientations toward communication influence the way in which persuasive situations are perceived and enacted. (Tables and figures are appended.

        "description":"Much discussion within media ethics has focused on the acceptability of surreptitious tape recording of news sources by media professionals. The most common legal and social arguments supporting secret taping assert that recorders &quot;hear&quot; and &quot;remember&quot; better, are expedient and practical, protect against libel suits, provide historical documentation, and are legal in 78% of the United States. In &quot;Nieman Reports,&quot; a prime example of the justificatory rhetoric emerging in the media professionals' journals, Theodore L. Glasser argues that secret taping does not invade privacy, is not necessarily antidemocratic or dangerous, and is different from wire-tapping and entrapment. However, deeper questions about interviewing are raised by the negative arguments, which claim that secret  taping: (1) preserves greater intimacy between source and reporters than is assumed by the source; (2) forfeits a source's confidentiality and right to speak &quot;off the record&quot;; (3) decreases trust; (4) is, or should be, illegal; (5) increases eavesdropping potential and source identification; (6) might change the source's behavior; (7) precludes the source's chance for retraction or denial; (8) violates beliefs of certain cultures; (9) exposes vulnerabilities; (10) is associated with wrongful conduct; (11) alters power relations; and (12) implies that ends justify means. Comparative analysis shows that, while surreptitious taping can be justified in both practical and moral terms, dangerous and subtle problems with this practice surface when issues of human dignity, truth, and freedom are  considered.

Findings are presented from a recently completed study of the major successes and problems encountered by public school principals during the first years on the job--specifically, their frustrations about being unable to do their jobs effectively due to insufficient preparation to achieve success. Major categories of concern requiring support include: problems with role clarification; limitations on  technical expertise in dealing with procedural issues and interpersonal relations skills; and socialization in the profession and in individual school systems.

        "author":["Berman, David M."],
        "description":"In structure and in function, the Japanese high school entrance examination--as exemplified by data from Chiba prefecture in 1986--survives as a prewar hierarchical cultural pattern. Postwar American occupation reforms offered &quot;democratic education&quot; in the form of a single-track system with 9 years of compulsory schooling; such a system, ideally, increases educational opportunities. In practice, however, entrance examinations make the system function in the same fashion as the prewar multitrack system. Examinations stratify high school populations into hierarchies; in Chiba, the implicit distinction between those of higher and lower quality is explicitly seen in quantitative ranking based upon examination scores. Examinations promote prefectural level stratification because  administrators use the entrance examination to organize secondary education. Educators follow prefectural policy--their careers depend upon students' examination success. The high school entrance examination thus determines emphasis of a particular junior high school on the one hand, and a stratified senior high school population on the other. Education is functionally integrated at the secondary level in that everyone associated with education in the prefecture derives success from performance in relation to the entrance examinations. It is agreed that the purpose of education is to prepare the student to pass the entrance examination. Consensus about this measure of success allows education to function without dissonance. Ideology is accordingly harmonious with a system that integrates  American educational structure into the traditional Japanese cultural context. Data from schools are presented; six reference pages conclude the report. (CJH)",

        "description":"This review of research on instructional improvement and teacher evaluation considers the complex issues affecting the K-8 principal's ability to enhance educational quality through effective supervision of the instructional process. According to several studies, teachers found formal evaluations far less valuable than direct assistance and support. A recent study of improving school systems found that teacher evaluations focus on the formative process of observing teachers, arranging conferences with them, and recognizing them as professionals. Some studies found uniform procedures unsatisfactory because teachers vary widely in their abilities, experiences, styles, and needs. The studies suggest that principals need to take their own strengths and weaknesses as instructional  leaders into account and obtain appropriate assistance in the instructional improvement effort. Experienced teachers can be a valuable source of such assistance because they understand the situations faced by other teachers and are trusted by them. The twofold role of the teacher supervisor--as a performance rater and as a guide to improvement--must be clear to both the supervisor and the teachers. Those who help teachers develop instructional improvement plans should be aware of the developmental phases identified in the research: diagnostic, tactical, and strategic. The process involves identifying and enhancing the \"level of abstraction\" at which each teacher operates. (PGD)",

        "description":"Cokeville Elementary School in Afton, Wyoming, was taken hostage on May 16, 1986. Two self-styled &quot;revolutionaries&quot; held 135 children, 14 teachers, the principal, and 3 other adults confined in a classroom for just over 2 hours. The siege ended violently when one of the perpetrators accidentally killed herself by unintentionally detonating a bomb. The blast injured several of the hostages as well. A review of the events reveals that the teachers and the principal coped with the situation very effectively, preventing panic both before and after the explosion and helping reduce the psychological trauma associated with the experience. The event also helped clarify how five generalizations about dealing with the aftereffects of trauma can be put into practice in a specific situation  in a practical manner. These five generalizations are that: (1) willingness to be receptive to people's feelings about an event must be made clear; (2) professional psychological help must be considered; (3) a sense of order (established before the crisis) must be maintained during and after the event; (4) methods should be found to facilitate a rapid return to normalcy; and (5) traumatic events can and should be transformed into valuable learning experiences.

Special topics discussed include racial differences in preprimary enrollments, an estimate of high school dropout rates, changes in the sex composition of college students, and the proportions of students who are returning to college after some period of time out of school. Some highlights of the topics discussed are: (1) in October 1983, 57.8 million persons aged 3 to 34 were enrolled in schools; (2) the number of nursery school students has increased by 75 percent in the past 10 years; (3) whereas elementary school enrollments, at 27.2 million, will soon stop decreasing and begin rising, high school enrollments of 14 million are down substantially  from 1977 when there were 15.8 million students; and (4) college enrollments, at 10.8 million, are substantially greater than the 8.2 million students enrolled in 1973. Increases in college enrollment have occurred in part because of rising participation rates of women. In addition, students 35 and older now account for over 12 percent of all college students. Seven tables are included with the text. The main body of the report consists of 25 detailed tables. The appendixes contain 14 supplementary tables, the sources of the data, and an assessment of the reliability of the estimates. (MLF)",

Six tables and three figures provide statistical data. An overview describes the availability and analysis problems concerning these data, for example, the lack of information on increasingly attended non-Catholic religiously affiliated schools. Data analysis includes total enrollment (with trends from 1970-85), proportion of students attending private schools, with attendance by region and metropolitan status. Private school students' are charted by family income, control of school (e.g., religiously affiliated), attendance, parental educational attainment, and race/ethnicity. Tuition and fees since 1979 are presented according to the  foregoing categories. The report includes the following data implications: (1) Greater diversity in types of private schools attended occurs as the proportion of enrollment in Catholic schools descreases and the proportion in other religiously affiliated schools increases. (2) Diversity in racial/ethnic background presents mixed trends; fewer black students but about the same number of Hispanics attended private schools in 1985 as in 1979. (3) Relative sizes of private and public school sectors have changed little in recent years. (4) Private schools' tuitions increased considerably faster than the cost of living between 1979-85, especially for church-related schools.

This gap exists despite emphasis placed on education as a means of reducing social inequality. These differences, when combined with similar disparities in other social indicators such as life expectancy, employment, and composition of prison populations, pose a significant challenge to the belief in equality, social justice, and the potential attainment and maintenance of social harmony. Statistics reveal that over one-half of Maori students who took School Certificate examinations received grades below that required to proceed,  whereas only 26.5 percent of non-Maori received a similar grade. Access to and progress through schools has been changed significantly due to curriculum modifications, and greater attention is being paid to Maori language and culture; yet, educational disparities continue. The development of: (1) educational programs aimed at the remediation of educational disadvantage and (2) research that seeks to discover clues to avoid entrenching educational disadvantage continue to be of the greatest importance. Efforts will be needed in other public sectors such as health and justice and the wider community if major changes are to result. Concluding the paper are 3 tables and 16 references. (WTH)",

Each grant's legislation was reviewed and federal program officials were interviewed to confirm agency interpretations of key legislative provisions. Data are offered in six tables. Table 1 lists block grants reviewed and their implementing agencies. The second table enumerates three types of data collection and reporting requirements imposed on federal agencies: (1) reporting to Congress on program activities, (2) program assessment data, and (3) compliance reviews of  state program operations. States that receive block grant funds must furnish data to federal agencies for congressional review, and must meet four requirements, given in table 3: grant applications demonstrating funding plans, reports of actual funding use, fiscal expenditure reports, and financial and compliance audits. Table 4 presents the statutory requirements for federal participation in the development of national data systems; model criteria and standardized forms must be developed by agencies administering 5 of 10 block grants for uniform data collection. Federal agencies use supplemental data sources for congressional reports; these are enumerated in table 5. Table 6 describes limits on funding amounts for states' administration of eight grants, including the education grant.  States may spend 20 percent (including administrative costs) of allocations for the education block grant. (CJH)",

Two separate questionnaires were administered, one collecting information on school characteristics from administrators in a nationally representative sample of 1,174 private schools, and the second collecting information from a representative sample of 5,295 teachers among the sampled schools. Linking teacher data with school characteristics increased the utility of information gathered. Data are presented in 49 tables, 4 figures, and 2 appendices. School information is compared with previous study years and with data gathered from studies of public institutions. School findings are discussed concerning private elementary and secondary schools, school  characteristics, staffing, and availability of programs and services. Teacher findings are discussed in terms of characteristics, compensation, teaching and nonteaching activities, training and assignment, class size and homework assignments, and teacher attitudes. Summary statistics on private shcool teachers include the following: of the 404,000 teachers in private schools, 46 percent teach in Catholic schools, 32 percent teach in other religious schools, and 23 percent teach in nonsectarian schools. About three out of four are female, and most are white. Nearly one in three has either a master's degree or Ph.D. The mean base salary of private school teachers is $14,400; those in private secondary schools receive the highest ($17,100), whereas private elementary school teachers receive  the lowest ($12,900).

The follow-up survey was initiated to gather information for a school district program evaluation system. The survey occurs during Christmas holidays, drawing former students from random samples. Data use is categorized by location of students, program quality checks, trend data, and public relations. Trained callers ask questions which will elicit information to be used for longitudinal analysis and for application to currently evaluated programs, including the state competency program. In 1984,  respondents were asked to &quot;grade&quot; aspects of school programs from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F,&quot; instead of using previous responses of &quot;excellent,&quot;&quot;average,&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;; as a result, data collection was improved. Telephone survey offers the opportunity to clarify data and to include an open response section about suggested school improvements. Student background information, already contained in school data processing records, is not needed. Callers code data according to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Two-year comparison data are used frequently for program planning. Changes are not now anticipated, other than to expand the survey to follow up students from previous surveys. (CJH)",

In the landmark decision in &quot;Grove City College v.

This article presents a case study of political action in California where a &quot;State Title IX&quot; law, which became known as the Sex Equity in Education Act, was signed into law in 1982. An account is  provided of follow-up actions occurring as a result of women organizing and preparing a model for implementing the new law. Development and enactment of the California State &quot;Title IX&quot; bill is outlined, along with steps taken and the benefits received.

        "description":"This paper reports a 2-year study of education policy that sought to identify, describe, and analyze the essential building blocks of state-level education policy and to discover the factors responsible for creating differences among states in their use of these elements to construct an overall framework for school regulation and support. Sample selection for the study involved two analytical levels: identification of a sample of six state policy systems, and selection of 140 key actors within those states for interview and survey data collection. The six states are: Arizona, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin. After an executive summary, chapter 1 outlines the background for the study of state education policy systems and lists 26 references. Chapter  2 describes the research design and methodology for the study and lists 18 references. Chapter 3 examines the state policy mechanisms of ranking, attention, and knowledgeability. Chapter 4 looks at competing approaches to seven alternative state policy mechanisms. The fifth chaper explores values in legislative codes and cites nine references. Chapter 6 examines political culture values of state education policymakers and cites 32 references. Chapter 7 looks at state statistical profiles that illuminate educational policy in the six sample states. The eighth chapter describes public values as origins of policy actions. Chapter 9 explores the influence, power, and policymaking processes and lists nine references. The final chapter examines assumptive worlds and education policymakers and  cites 37 references. A total of 65 tables, 40 figures, and 10 appendices containing the study instruments and data collection forms are included. (WTH)",

In &quot;Introduction and Problem Statement,&quot; Robert H. Beach states that problems in American education stem from a structurally dysfunctional system, are not isolated and specific as the literature suggests, and should be viewed and treated in a holistic fashion. Three papers were presented at the symposium. First, &quot;The School Finance Perspective&quot; (Ronald A. Lindahl) examines school finance in relation to philosophical, legal, governance, structural, and planning concerns in education. Second, &quot;The Perspective from Planning and Organizational Theory&quot; (William D. McInerney) examines the public  school administrator's use of a rational comprehensive model in educational planning and describes the limited applicability of that model to educational organizations. Finally, &quot;The Perspective That Schools Cannot Be Improved Until the Defects of Their Systemic Organizations Are Removed&quot; (A. W. VanderMeer) focuses on intellectual development, socialization, and custodial functions in schools, and states that schools are organized in such a way as to frustrate attempts to achieve improvements in the performance of these functions.

Information was gathered from case studies in nine major metropolitan areas, questionnaires administered to over 200 school board chairpersons, and literature on board governance. Chapter 1 offers an overview and questionnaire results. Chapter 2 summarizes major findings. The historical role of school boards is discussed in chapter 3. Chapter 4, on the working board, interprets challenges faced in developing operating structures. The board-superintendent relationship is explored in chapter 5. The report probes, in chapter 6, issues confronting boards. Board members' and citizens' satisfactions and dissatisfactions with board service and practices are analyzed in chapter 7. The need for increased  attention to board development for individuals and for boards is stressed in chapter 8, along with recommendations. The final chapter presentes 15 indicators of an effective board. Major findings are that citizens support the ideal of local governance of education through school boards, but not necessarily the board of their own community. Despite this approval, the public knows little about boards' functioning. States' increased visibility in education creates further confusion about responsibilities. Difficulties are forecast as student populations diversify and management becomes more complex. Local governance needs informed support from communities. Thirty-nine references are included. (CJH)",

        "description":"This paper examines factors that promote and diminish teacher trust in the instructional supervision process. Trust--key to the supervisor's success in helping teachers change behaviors--is correlated with such factors as confidentiality, approach to dealing with complaints, and the development of collaboration and participation in supervisory processes. Trust is low when a supervisor takes a teacher's confidential expressions of need and makes it reflect negatively on her evaluation. Supervisors who stress authority and identification of weaknesses build less trust than those who emphasize collegiality, productive diversity, and strengths. A study of 150 teachers in seven Kansas school districts identified supervisor practices that either enhanced or diminished trust; these  practices include orientation, tone, feedback, listening skills, and support. A staff development program that elicits teachers' responses to favorable and unfavorable experiences with supervision can provide supervisors with positive notions about change, and 12 steps for building such a program are described. Supervisors develop a caring interpersonal relationship with teachers through showing consideration, appreciation, and respect, and by giving appropriate positive feedback. Areas of competence that enhance teacher trust include honest discussion of assessment goals and sharing knowledge about factors that positively influence student achievement. Relationships of trust evolve through time and effort and useful feedback from supervisors enables teachers to improve the quality of  their decision making. Eleven references are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"Problems in supervision stem from the reality that operationalizing supervision is not a cognitive state of mind, but one in the affective domain, contrary to most techniques. Administrators often discover that the interpersonal skills needed in facilitating change and dealing with resistance are not available. This paper outlines a process that energizes and empowers employees; it consists of four steps: (1) focusing--setting short- and long-term goals, an activity which incorporates role definition and clarification, behavioral objectives, and evaluation criteria; (2) coaching--providing expertise on how to improve and enhance a teaching technique through various processes; (3) counseling--providing opportunities for administrator and teacher to reflect on a particular lesson,  to examine reasons for success, or to explore options to improve performance; and (4) evaluating--occurring at the end of the year whereby the problem-solving process is culminated. To operationalize this process, the use of the sensing interview is suggested to (1) diagnose the problem by listening to the employee, (2) acknowledge understanding, (3) explore options, and (4) respond. In this way, both evaluator and evaluatee are on the same side, without blame, and the employee is empowered to develop new skills, explore and change behaviors, and accept responsibility.

Data were collected using existing organizational health questionnaires and archival data. A sample was randomly selected from the population of public high schools in Connecticut. Seven &quot;organizational health&quot; characteristics were used, including leadership, cohesiveness, resource utilization, adaptiveness, optimum power equalization, morale, and planning. Financial variables included mean class size, percent of teachers with master's degree, minimum teacher salary, maximum teacher salary, enrollment, per pupil expenditure, instructional supply per pupil, pupil services per pupil, special instructional programs per pupil, special state aid per  pupil, and federal aid per pupil. Statistical treatment was step-wise multiple regression with the seven &quot;health&quot; characteristics as dependent variables. Only a marginal relationship was found to exist between any of the financial and organizational variables; however, a modest relationship was found to exist between selected variables, and these findings warrant further examination with redesigned studies before policy decisions can be developed.

Recommendations include (1) increasing future administrators' awareness of the fundamental features or &quot;realities&quot; of the principal's job; (2) providing opportunities to reflect on the actual purpose behind the skills of the job; (3) creating more specialized inservice training programs; (4) reducing feelings of isolation through a &quot;buddy system&quot; enabling the new principal to receive feedback; and (5) providing a more experienced principal to turn to for advice.

The reform originated from a smaller project that aimed to establish a broad communication base and systematic planning for meeting student needs. The current project, begun in 1985-86, also incorporated improved communication among district staff and community members as well as staff training, administrative leadership changes, and renewal expansion to other districts. By 1986-87, nine districts and two universities formed the consortium and adopted priorities that include: teacher education improvement, at-risk students, administrator preparation, clinical experiences, and data gathering and analysis. To meet these  goals, consortium partners agreed to participate in collaborative inquiry. A task force recommended methods to document the renewal process, which included the following: letters of commitment from districts and universities, minutes of meetings, documentation of activities such as teacher workshops and public forums, a yearly evaluative survey of stakeholders' perceptions, and a yearly progress report. The consortium nevertheless expressed concerns about sufficient time to compile information and about the value of data. Sharing information on a regular basis enabled inquiry considerations during this developmental phase, and the renewal approach offered those persons with legitimate concerns opportunities for resolution. A list of consortium members is appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"Five articles address current teaching and programming practices in the education and treatment of behaviorally disordered youth. In &quot;Down the Up Staircase: The Teacher as Therapist,&quot; P. Nichols explores the premise that teachers should not limit their potential as child helpers by excluding counseling and psychotherapeutic interventions. &quot;Videotape Feedback as a Therapeutic Tool&quot; (D. Raschke et al.) describes ways in which educators can effectively use videotape feedback to help behaviorally disordered students become more aware of the consequences of their behavior and develop constructive alternatives. In &quot;Job Training/Career Awareness Partnership Program for Emotionally Disturbed Juvenile Delinquent Youth,&quot; M. Weber outlines components of a community-based alternative to  incarceration or institutionalization. &quot;Extending Emotional Responses through Poetry Experiences&quot; (J. M. Harms et al.) illustrates how poetry can encourage a more flexible and creative view of life experiences for children with emotional and behavioral problems. Finally, &quot;A Transitional Education Model for Reintegrating Behaviorally Disordered Students from Residential Treatment Centers to Public School Programs&quot; (H. S. Muscott and R. Bond) describes a model for systematically preparing students for less restrictive environments, using the Transition Classroom as the linkage between the treatment facility and the local school district.

An introduction discusses symptoms of hearing loss, defines speech and language, traces general expectations at school, and touches briefly on hearing aids, sign systems, and ways parents can help, including learning sign language. Subsequent sections address the following topics very briefly: causes of deafness; significance of early detection; directions for three teaching activities; hearing aids and how to care for them; discipline; toilet training; multiple handicaps; and vocational guidance.

The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory was administered to evaluate differences in home environment variables before and after systematic family-oriented intervention. Intervention provided to the experimental group included transdisciplinary assessment and development of an individualized education program (IEP); free-play observation of parent and child; assessment of family needs and development of an individualized family plan; sessions with a family therapist; and optional participation in parent and sibling  groups. Families carried out play and learning activities at home between weekly intervention visits. As measured by HOME Inventory, maternal involvement, availability of play materials, and overall home environment ratings significantly increased for the experimental group. Scores for the comparison group did not change over the 6-month period. (Author/JW)",

The first chapter examines the development of public educational systems with sections on the historical context, the present status of the resource room model, the present status of the teacher consultant model, and the possibility of system unification. The next chapter considers the concept of shared responsibility, with focus on prereferral and teaming as shared responsibilities. The third chapter discusses personnel role changes in sections on role change and preparation needs for special educators, general educators, and administrators, respectively;  as well as the impact of the effective schools movement. The final chapter is on fiscal concerns, especially the impetus given by limited funds for effective interaction between general and special education. Each chapter ends with a brief summary and lists responsibilities of local special education administrators. These include the need to seek models through which productive merging of special and general education resources and programs may be institutionalized and to seek out ways to reduce duplication and conserve the fiscal resources of both general and special education.

During one spring semester, each student was trained for 12 weeks in the use of a specific social skill (such as compliance, cooperative play, or non-argumentative behavior) in the learning disabilities resource room. Training included discussion and verbal rehearsal of means and results of using the social skills with the subjects. Once the student's use of the social skills had become proficient, attempts to establish the skill outside the resource room (such as in a mainstreamed classroom) were initiated. Reinforcement (systematic teacher attention, parent encouragement) were  delivered to students in the new environments. When the students were again observed during the following fall semester for nine weeks, it appeared that all students manifested generalization of the social skills to the new environments.

Results demonstrated little difference between the regular and special educators' responses to both stress and coping. Both groups of teachers reported administrative variables, student behaviors, pressure, and paperwork as producing the greatest amount of stress. More teachers of ED and LD children than teachers of MR or other handicapped children reported the administration as their most common source of stress. ED teachers reported conflicts between themselves and other staff members, as well as no student progress, to be  more stressful than other special educators. MR teachers reported inappropriate student behaviors less frequently (15%) than either ED or LD teachers as a source of stress; and only 2% of the other special educators saw inappropriate student behaviors as a source of stress. LD teachers and other special educators reported internalizing stress as a coping mechanism more frequently than either MR or ED teachers. All groups of teachers reported internalizing stress, talking to a safe person, and engaging in alternative activities as the most common methods of coping with stress. (DB)",

A documentation format, the Transition Plan, has been developed to be coordinated with the secondary Individual Education Plan. The plan is first put into effect during the  student's junior year of high school. The plan includes the following components: past services received (level of service, diagnostic testing, amount of mainstreaming); current services received (accommodations needed, individual strengths and weaknesses); vocational goals (desired occupation, vocational testing, job experience); postsecondary goals (institution selected, needed accommodations); and specific objectives to be completed (materials/techniques to be utilized, completion dates, and persons responsible). Major strengths of the Sample Transition Plan include the use of critical information from the student's past files that directly influence postsecondary decisions.

One section discusses the continuum of services for children with special needs involving five major areas: primary prevention activities; early intervention services; evaluation,  assessment, and diagnostic services; in-home and community services; and substitute care services. A second section discusses interagency issues in managing the continuum of children's services and considers children not covered in the plan; ongoing long-range planning; service planning and case management; community education regarding the availability of services; coordinated interface with private sector providers; transitioning services; interagency licensing and monitoring; and interagency rate setting.

The overall goal of this project was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the PIC as a screening device for use with preschool populations. The project consisted of two studies. The first study assessed the utility of the PIC profile scales with 120 3- to 5-year-olds attending a therapeutic preschool for learning disabled and emotionally disturbed children and with 43 preschool children not identified as needing special services. The second study examined the correlation between PIC scale scores and teacher ratings with 10 handicapped preschool children and 23 children in Head  Start. Appropriate PIC scales were found to correlate significantly with teacher ratings as well as with measures of intelligence and language ability, suggesting both convergent and discriminate validity. Regression analysis correctly classified 92% of the sample. Temporal stability of the PIC was also established as 31 mothers completed the PIC twice (average time between testings 2 weeks). The studies suggest the effectiveness of parent informants in screening children to assess the need for special education services. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"There has been a considerable expansion in the uses and definitions of giftedness constructs since 1958, when constructs were typically defined in very narrow cognitive terms (such as intelligence test scores). Currently, gifted constructs have a wide variety of definitions which reflect closely-linked processes used for identifying and selecting (and subsequently labelling) gifted pupils and for making decisions about program goals and procedures. The breadth of such constructs range from definitions involving a single characteristic (such as creativity or mathematical aptitude) to those which include a broad range of cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. Other dimensions in the variability of gifted constructs include content, level of exceptionality, a static or dynamic  focus, and precision of the construct's definition. Another issue of importance concerns the sources of definitions for constructs; these include derivations from theory, derivations from selection instruments, and empirical derivations. To be accurate and meaningful, each gifted construct should have four conditions: explicit definition; a theory-value base; derivation of the selection model from the construct; and empirical validation.

        "description":"Four samples of language-impaired and control children (N=233, ages from 4 to 14) participated in seven experiments to determine the specific conditions under which retrieval deficits play a role in language-impaired children's word finding problems. Experiments 1-5 dealt with recall, retrieval, and similarity judgments of words presented individually or in lists of words. Experiments 6 and 7 were concerned with naming of pictures and recall of words presented in larger and more meaningful linguistic contexts. Results provided little support for a retrieval deficit interpretation of the language-impaired children's poorer performance in the experiments. The language-impaired children recalled fewer words, and both named pictures and judged picture names more slowly than their  same-age peers. However, like their peers, these children used item typicality, as well as superordinate category, semantic-syntactic, and textual information to guide retrieval. Results suggested limits in &quot;elaboration&quot; skills of the impaired children. Words, being less well known by language-impaired children, may be represented in a less elaborate form in semantic memory and it is this unelaborate representation of words that make accessing words difficult for language-impaired children. The findings suggest the utility of intervention approaches that provide children with a richer base of information about a word's meaning, use, and syntactic privileges of occurrence, and suggest caution in the use of approaches that teach children strategies for retrieval without providing  information about the words to be retrieved.

A framework is provided for reviewing a district's current recruitment program and creative strategies are shared for improving recruiting efforts. Monograph sections contain: an overview of guide content and suggested use; three worksheets for assessing a recruitment program (elements of successful recruiting, prioritizing areas for improvement, and planning for improvement); discussion of elements of an effective recruiting program (including program organization, development and use of recruiting materials, identification of staff needs, announcement of vacancies, application processing, new staff orientation, and program  monitoring and improvement); and resources. These include a 27-citation bibliography and three appendixes: a summary of the results of a survey undertaken to direct the development of this guide, a list of the larger circulation state and regional newspapers that will list teacher vacancies, and a chart displaying information about institutions which train special education personnel.

First, relevant characteristics of persons with movement, sensory, hearing, or cognitive disabilities are listed and related strategies for solution are described (e.g., use of alternate input approaches for the movement impaired, voice output for the visually impaired). The next section looks at ways existing computers could be made more accessible through such means as keyboard options, an alternate keyboard access feature in operating systems, visual redundancy of auditory information, and availability of an audio or headphone  signal. Ways in which these access modifications can increase the usefulness of computers for the disabled (and market size for manufacturers) are pointed out. Possible ways that future computer accessibility for the disabled may evolve are noted and include increased availability of alternate interfaces, separation of programs from the input/output hardware, greater difficulty for the visually impaired as the visual complexity of displays increases, and increased use of voice-to-text translators by the hearing impaired. Attached are a position paper and a proceedings report pertaining to two computer industry/government meetings held February 1984 and October 1985 with the purpose of formally addressing the problem of computer accessibility for the handicapped.

The project had three major objectives: (1) to design a low-cost portable writing and computer access aid using existing technology, (2) to provide alternative communication integrated with writing and computer access; and (3) to provide a tutorial manual that allows naive users to learn the system. The project resulted in a special computer program which turns the Epson HX-20 general purpose computer into a dedicated writing, conversation, and computer access aid with a structured tutorial manual. Results of field testing  with 13 users and 6 consultants indicated that the Trine System can be learned effectively from the guidebook and that it can meet basic communication and writing needs of persons in educational settings. A nonexclusive marketing plan (in which a limited number of organizations have the right to produce and sell the system) was used and the Trine System is now available through two commercial companies. Among appendixes are product brochures, a conference paper on the design and testing of a tutorial manual, several questionnaires on system use and evaluation, and a manual critique. (Author/DB)",

The study used observation, structured interviews, and periodic data collection to examine patterns of refugee interaction and to develop a profile of language needs for comparison with the program's existing curriculum. The major finding of the program is a pronounced tendency of the refugees to depend on third parties in situations requiring interaction with Americans. A tendency of the third parties to help these refugees to the extent that it interferes with their language acquisition and acculturation was found to compound this dependency. The sponsors' curriculum was found to correspond to the refugees' language needs established  in the profile, but little English use was observed outside the classroom, suggesting the need to change the types of learning activities and services offered in the program.

The FI cohort and a control group matched for mental abilities and communities were administered reading tests in third and fourth grade. As predicted, the FI students performed below the control group on the first test but attained scores that were at least equal in the fourth grade. A test of inference and generalization administered in fifth grade to the two groups showed consistently but marginally superior scores in all skill areas for the FI group. Item analysis and examination of subgroup  performance indicated some areas for improvement or future investigation, including use of the more advanced test at the fourth and seventh grade levels and expansion of the language testing to include vocabulary, punctuation, grammar, and capitalization.

Within six months of CMLR implementation, a test of reading comprehension found the KPS students with slightly higher mean average scores than their non-FI peers and significantly higher scores than their FI peers. A year later, a test of literal comprehension resulted in lower scores for the KPS group than for others, but the difference was marginal when gifted student scores were factored out. Another six months later, a more comprehensive reading test of factual  comprehension, inference, and generalization skills resulted in KPS scores equal to the scores of non-FI students when gifted scores were factored out. Item analysis and skills analysis identified apparent strengths and weaknesses of the KPS performance in comparison to other groups, and resulted in recommendations for action. (Author/MSE)",

Using the media enables many of the features of the natural language acquisition process to be brought into play in a way that much current language teaching material does not. This position is supported by recent research into the processes of reading and listening. The paper also discusses some of the ways in which activities preceding or accompanying the use of media texts can make the texts accessible to a wide variety of learners, including beginners. Beginners can be helped not only to understand foreign language texts but also to create and edit their own texts at a relatively sophisticated level. This approach greatly enriches the comprehensible linguistic  input while also reducing affective barriers to language learning.

The students' diary journal entries and writing assignments based on previous classwork are examined. Retelling of stories previously told by the teacher and the journal entries helped identify the kind of language used by students, the code-switching differences in oral versus written language, and the relationship of code-switching to the type or purpose of the writing. The study found evidence of language variation in the form of language interference and code-switching. Samples of interference clearly demonstrate the students' occasional need to fall back on first-language competence to communicate a message. Code-switching instances suggest a difference between previously reported  language mixing in speech and code-switching in writing. Written code-switching was limited to single lexical items or very short phrases. In addition, the purpose of the writing appeared to affect code-switching tendencies, with more code-switching appearing in free-writing journal entries than in assigned work.

The first section sketches federal involvement in bilingual education and related programs and outlines some of the responses from local education agencies. The second section discusses issues faced by providers of technical assistance in overcoming resistance to change. It looks at introducing bilingual education into a district, voluntary and mandated change, technical assistance centers, and the role of the technical assistance provider. Section three outlines and examines substantive options for school districts in program  design, teacher training, and evaluation. Program design issues include district-wide bilingual education policy, program fragmentation, language arts instruction programs, entry and exit criteria, and content area instruction. Teacher and training issues include finding appropriate bilingual and English-as-a-second-language staff, bilingual materials, and inservice training program design. Evaluation issues include the potential advantages and problems evaluation poses, types of evaluation, creating effective evaluation, and data analysis and interpretation. (MSE)",

Chapter one answers some of the most common questions about learning foreign languages, including the best age and means for language learning, avoiding mistakes, dealing with the inability to understand a message, the time needed to master the language, what makes some learners more successful than others, and strategies for learning languages. Chapter two outlines basic strategies used by successful language learners to manage their learning, such as experimenting with the language, recognizing and learning from errors, evaluating progress, and self-encouragement. Ways to organize language learning, including setting goals, deciding on skills priorities, keeping a notebook,  scheduling learning, and focusing attention, are the subjects of chapter three. Chapter four gives helpful hints on how to retain vocabulary, grammar, and concepts in a new language. The fifth chapter covers strategies for learning with an instructor or by independent study, and the final chapter presents ways to continue learning the language in specific situations on the job.

The approach focuses on development of three characteristics: positive interdependence, individual accountability, and social skills related to small-group interaction. These characteristics of cooperative learning are incorporated into familiar language-learning activities. Teachers make a commitment to the belief that each student can learn by interacting with peers.

The material can be used in many disciplines including engineering, business, marketing, and technology. The concept of market segmentation is primarily a transportation planning technique by which the needs of a specific locale or population are systematically determined and compared to existing services within the same locale to identify unmet transportation needs. The unmet needs are used as the basis for targeting new or modified services. A series of steps for segmenting a region or population are outlined, and problems and issues that arise throughout the process are discussed. To illustrate the market segmentation  approach, characteristics of various segments (e.g., commuters, transportation handicapped) are discussed, as well as major issues involved in transportation for different groups. Identifying market segments and their needs often involves data collection from various sources, including regional/local planning data and social service agencies. To assess existing services, operational characteristics may be studied as well as cost effectiveness measures. An eight-page bibliography is appended. (SW)",

Early stages of the project focused on selection of assessment instruments and the student sample, and on introducing faculty to the use of student assessment information in curricular planning and evaluation. The assessment process focuses on both general education and liberal education goals and student gains toward career preparation. Student growth assessment will involve: measuring cognitive  and affective growth toward education outcomes established by faculty committees; assessing writing skills periodically; assessing graduates' mastery of major field subject matter; assessing the relationship between course grading and other indicators of student growth; and implementing surveys to determine student attitudes and activities.

A second application is the need to address reflection in  work-related learning. This could be done by forming a voluntary peer group that provides a forum to identify and examine undiscussables in organizational life.

The 10 presidents ranged in age from the late 30s to the early 60s, with an average age of 52.2. Their baccalaureate education involved a variety of disciplines with only one in theology, and all had earned doctorates. Eight of the 10 had previously been an academic vice president, and the sample had an average of 26.5 years of full-time experience in higher education. Seven management practices common to the 10 presidents were: the use of a President's Cabinet to advise the president significantly affected the college; the presidents  emphasized relationships with the board and the faculty; they stressed planning; they insisted that the whole college be well managed; they insisted on delegation; they emphasized people; and they were interested and active in the community outside the campus. The presidents' attitudes toward the college's relationship with the church and its role in affirming the faith of students were also determined. (SW)",

Academic year 1985-1986 was the fifth consecutive year that salary increases for full-time faculty outpaced inflation, and the largest real income gain for faculty for the five-year period beginning in 1981-1982. The average salary of teaching faculty nationwide, combining all institutions and academic ranks, was $32,400 in 1985-1986. Instructional faculty received 13.7% higher average salaries at four-year than at two-year institutions. Salaries grew slower in the private sector at both four-year and two-year  institutions. Average salaries (all ranks combined) were 24.4% higher for men than women in 1985-1986. Examined by academic rank, however, the salary gap between the sexes was considerably less; the largest difference was among lecturers. Schools in the Far West region of the United States had the highest average salary for instructional faculty (all ranks combined) and institutions in the Southeast region, the lowest. (SW)",

While the overall enrollment for fall 1985 showed little change from fall 1984, the enrollment of first-time freshmen continued to decline, reflecting the decline of the population of 18- to 19- year-olds.

Two measures of persistence were considered: (1) the percent of students who dropped out during the year and (2) for students who successfully persisted the previous year, the percent who returned to the same school to continue their studies. To control for differences in persistence rates for lower income families, the analyses included adjustments for family income levels. To estimate the effects of grants on college dropout rates, four groups of students were compared: students who received no grants, students who received any type of grant in any amount, students  who received Pell grants in any amount, and students who received grant aid totaling at least one-half of tuition costs. In seven of eight comparisons, the \"no grant\" group dropped out during the year at higher rates than the \"big grant\" group. In public institutions, students who received some grant aid dropped out at lower rates than students who did not receive any grants during their first 3 years of college.

The supply of physician gerontologists and geriatricians, the attention they pay to the special needs of the elderly, and the adequacy of their training are addressed in these hearings, which consider a Senate bill to improve the education in geriatrics of primary care physicians. Attention is directed to four specific concerns: (1) whether older persons differ from younger people in ways that have implications for medical practice, and whether there is a body of knowledge about these differences; (2) whether the differences have implications for the training of medical practitioners; (3) the present and near-term future availability of appropriately trained  medical personnel; and (4) feasible and reasonable ways to train additional numbers of such physicians, if more are needed. The bill, which would amend section 788 of the Public Health Service Act, would make available an additional $4 million to expand present programs and create new ones to train physicians who plan to teach geriatric medicine. Sponsors of the bill hope that by 1992 the program would produce an additional 900 physicians trained to teach residents and practicing physicians the essentials of geriatrics. (SW)",

The 1985 sample consisted of 839 counselors. In both 1982 and 1985, the survey instrument covered: communications between the Brockport campus and the guidance community; quality assessments of faculty, programs, students, and selectivity for each of the 15 competitor institutions; quality of specific programs at the Brockport campus; image impressions derived from multiple sources; types of students typically recommended to the Brockport campus; high school application and  articulation trend data; and evaluation of Brockport graduates. In 1982, Brockport ranked far behind its competitors in the perceived quality of faculty, programs, students, and selectivity. The 1985 results showed major advances in all areas, particularly in faculty and programs, as a result of improvements that were implemented, including more selective admissions standards. (SW)",

The objective is to advocate that institutional researchers focus more directly on the basic issues of teaching and learning and to suggest that improving instructional program quality will improve student learning. The framework identifies factors, or intervenors, that affect the type/amount of student learning as well as policies and programs that may affect these intervenors. Six intervenors are covered: student involvement, learning expectations, assessment and feedback, individualization, instructional methods, and content. The intervenors are used as criteria to review the quality of instructional  programs. Three types of improvement strategies are considered: student input (e.g., admissions, financial aid), process (resources and curriculum), and outcomes. Examples of quality improvement strategies for each type of strategy are identified. Finally, six implications for institutional research focusing on student learning and local improvement efforts are identified, including: preparation and continuing education needs of practitioners, and a new role and focus for policy analysis.

Generally, the results showed that students and faculty participants were supportive of the program. In open-ended survey questions, respondents discussed both administrative and academic problems: students focused more on the administrative problems, while faculty concentrated more on academic problems. Based on the evaluation, it was recommended that the program be  retained. While only a small number of students use the program, it was generally viewed as a good option for some students.

The percentage of entering freshmen dropping out during the first 6 weeks decreased from 12% in fall 1982 to 1% or 2% in fall 1984 and 1985. However, since many students postponed dropping out until the summer following  the freshman year, it is recommended that attention be devoted to post-freshman retention. In addition, there is a need to focus attention on the more able students since they increased markedly as a percentage of those dropping out prior to the sophomore year.

Nonacademic staff are categorized as follows: professional nonfaculty, clerical/secretarial, technical paraprofessional, skilled crafts, and service/maintenance. A change in the employment structure of U.S. colleges in the late 1960s is attributed in part to a rise in scientific research and instruction, a concern for the well-being of students, and changes in business technology. The case study university created a nonacademic personnel office unit in 1956 when the most significant increase in nonacademic staff seemed to be for library  and research staff and for laboratory and research technicians. By 1984 the most significant increase was for nonacademic professional staff, which represented nearly half the total nonacademic employees. Secretaries and clerical employees account for the largest single body of nonacademic employees. Today, the percentage of nonacademic staff is almost equal to the percentage of faculty. (SW)",

The economic benefits of nonresident students on the West Virginia economy was estimated by summing the approximated effects of three major categories of direct impact: tuition and fees, visitor expenditures, and student living expenses. A multiplier was used to estimate an indirect economic impact. The same methodology was used to estimate out-of-state visitor spending with the parks systems, as well as out-of-park spending. After estimating economic costs for nonresident students and park visitors, a benefit-to-cost ratio was calculated, as well as a per student  state educational subsidy (the differences between the state investment per full-time equivalent student and student charges (tuition and fees). In 1983-1984, the overall economic return to the state on its investment in nonresident student education approached three dollars for each state tax dollar invested.

Each reflects on the often unmanageable connections between information and power in organizations. The third theoretical argument, the organizational contingency argument, concerns the nature of fragmentation on a given campus. This argument suggests that the particular trajectory of institutional research fragmentation on a campus depends on specific organizational conditions on that campus, as well as on external forces. The  applicability of the theoretical perspective is considered, based on a case study analysis of the University of Minnesota. Informational legitimacy was found to be a factor in the fragmentation of institutional research, and limits on attention at the central level were also active in fragmentation. Forces that seem to be active in fragmentation include: the external environment, personalities and career paths, management styles, and power arrangements. (SW)",

During the 1960 to mid-1970 period, university access and the size of the university system increased significantly. Planning was incremental and focused on meeting future student target numbers, and enrollment and course choices were important to the planning process. Student flow models and workload models for resource allocation were of concern to researchers.  During the 1970s, the government continuously reduced its student number target for the 1980s. Education policy and access to college became dependent on year-by-year public expenditures. Long-term planning and strategic planning were not undertaken during the period of retrenchment; however, greater emphasis was placed on identifying quality and institutional strengths using performance indicators and portfolio analysis.

The decisive roll of political arguments and consequences for future government and academic planning are addressed. Both universities and government believed that ongoing retrenchment could no longer be spread over disciplines and faculties proportionally. The Ministry of Education introduced two sets of criteria, commonly used within the context of institutional research. One set of criteria was designed to select disciplines to be concentrated; the other set to select the universities at which a chosen discipline had to be concentrated. Application of the criteria to the fields of medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy is examined.  Analysis of the decision-making process and its results shows a significant contrast between the most likely outcomes of the application of the sets of criteria and the actual decisions made by the government. It is concluded that in the concentration process, the criteria can only be seen as a translation of underlying political, social, and cultural motives. (SW)",

For each year's follow-up instrument, students indicated two things: the estimated number of times during the year they had met with a faculty member outside the classroom for at least 15 minutes; and the average number of hours per week they had spent in organized extracurricular activities. Students also completed questionnaires that measured social and academic integration, as well as classroom and social involvement. LISREL analysis indicated  that students' academic integration in each of the 4 years had a direct and indirect effect on reported academic skill development in that year and in succeeding years. Social integration was more influential in students' reported academic growth in the junior and senior years. The nature and strength of these two influences varied over time, however, with the relative importance of academic and social integration reversing over the period. (SW)",

The first was the routine clerical market, needing fairly simple list processing of individual cases (students) in specified subgroups. This market was the largest one for the center and was best served with downloads of selected information to microcomputers. The second was the complex clerical market needing complex computed reports of individual cases. This market was growing and was best served through rapid prototyping of mainframe production  reports. The third was the decision support market, needing summary statistics across many subgroups. This market was the traditional one served by institutional research and had a strong need for data interpretation services.

Future directions in the ongoing project include the development of a university information system that will integrate faculty, student and space data, and the transfer of data from this system through the campus-wide network of personal computers.

        "description":"The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a measure of personality type and learning style, was used at Saint Louis University in the TRAILS (Tracking Retention and Academic Integration by Learning Style) Project. In addition to considering links between learning styles and student academic achievement and aptitude, MBTI was used to identify discrete academic populations and to assess persistence patterns. MBTI preference indices consist of extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judgment/perception. Certain MBTI learning styles were disproportionately represented in certain academic fields (e.g., the most abstract and reflective learning style was most common in the arts and sciences majors). Performance on aptitude measures differed by MBTI personality  types (e.g., students with the most concrete and active style scored lowest). It was also found that the greater the preference for intuition and for introversion, the better the first-term grade point average (GPA), and the greater the preference toward the judging mode, the better the GPA. Using MBTI indicators enables college researchers to assess both proxy measures of social and academic integration and the cognitive and affective processes that influence this integration. (SW)",

A total of 707 Ph.D. and Ed.D. recipients from 16 departments who had graduated between 1963 and 1984 were surveyed to determine: the impact of doctoral education on career development, the perceived influence of the institutional values on graduates, and the frequency and type of research or scholarly activities engaged in during and after graduate school. Data from the 168-item survey were analyzed by department, degree, and four general academic fields, and a number of indices were developed. The career development index included the following variables: relationship of degree to job and career, and postgraduate career path. Variables included in the institutional  values index were: concern for ethical values, interest in religious beliefs, and influence of the university on personal values. Activities to indicate scholarship included: submitting grant proposals and articles for publication, receiving external funding for research, and delivering papers. The analysis includes comparisons for graduates in the fields of education, humanities, social sciences, and medical sciences. (SW)",

        "description":"Log-linear modeling was employed to explore the conceptual relationships among community college student persistence and nine variables, including student demographics, purpose for enrolling, intentions to return, frequency of informal interaction with faculty, and satisfaction with the institution in general. The study sample was 369 new and continuing students enrolled at a surburban community college during fall 1984. Four hierarchical models that are posited indicate significant interactions between persistence and intentions to return and persistence and sex (i.e., full-time female students had greater persistence than their male counterparts). Measures of academic integration, such as grade-point average, number of hours spent studying each week, and frequency of  interaction with faculty, had independent effects. Review of conceptual models of persistence focusing on four-year colleges and universities suggests that academic integration may be of less importance in explaining persistence at community colleges than at four-year institutions. The application of log-linear modeling to higher education research, and specifically persistence studies, is discussed. (SW)",

Four student-institutional relationships are traced historically: in loco parentis, fiduciary, contractual, and constitutional. Issues concerning the evolution of constitutional rights in higher education include individual rights, due process, privacy rights, and First Amendment rights. Attention is also directed to several rights of association and  their effect on the recognition of religious and gay organizations and on regulations governing use of facilities. Religious and political objections concerning the use of mandatory student activity fees are covered, along with methods of fee collection. Also discussed are: the boundaries of constitutional protection for noncommercial and commercial speech and extensions to the college campus; and malpractice theory and the courts' position in educational malpractice.

A prototype was designed and implemented for the troubleshooting portion of the F111 6883 intermediate-level avionics test station in order to investigate a variety of issues, e.g., hybrid diagnostics, knowledge engineering, and user interfaces. The phases of the project included conceptual design, development, and delivery software programming; delivery hardware prototyping; knowledge base development; field demonstration; and analysis of lessons  learned. The design for the prototype incorporated both human-machine interfaces and end-user interfaces to promote incremental skill acquisition and assess the reasoning behind the diagnostic process in a troubleshooting situation. In a field demonstration, the prototype received high ratings for ease of use, speed of operation, troubleshooting accuracy, and usefulness for job aiding and training. Implications for future development focused on realizing the training potential of the system, enhancing user interfaces, and expanding the problem domain.

        "description":"This study aimed at finding the optimal condition of written instruction and online practice for learning a new computer application. Subjects were 44 undergraduate and graduate students and university staff members. Those in the experimental group learned commands for an electronic spreadsheet by reading user-manual descriptions and working training problems online. Training problems were varied in order to control how much independent problem solving subjects engaged in while learning any given command, and the forms of practice included pure guided practice, pure problem solving practice, and mixed practice. Spacing of the training problems was also manipulated. Subjects in the control group read the same text and studied the same training problems, but were not permitted to  type anything at the keyboard during the training session. After a 2-day delay, subjects in both groups solved new problems on the computer without reference to the instructional materials. The results indicate that problem solving was a more difficult form of training than guided practice, but it produced the best performance at test. Distributing the spacing of training problems during training also improved performance at test. These results have implications for the design of interactive tutorial manuals and for cognitive models of skill acquisition. Appended materials include a typical manual entry for an easy command and a difficult command, a 13-item reference list, one figure, and five tables. (DJR)",

        "description":"Although computers are used for administrative purposes and for grading in correspondence course programs throughout the United States, there has been little application to date of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in these programs. A survey was sent to 899 former students in Indiana University's high school independent study program to determine (1) to what extent various types of hardware are available to students in homes and schools; (2) what percentage have had experience with CAI; (3) how students react to CAI in general and to CAI in independent study courses in particular; and (4) what preferences students might have for implementation of CAI in independent study. Responses on the 81 questionnaires returned (9%) indicate that there would be ample interest in CAI if the  computer were used to present material that is difficult to present clearly in paper and print. Students also indicate that they would be interested in CAI only if it did not cause substantial price increases in courses and textbook materials. It was concluded that the most efficient way to implement CAI in a distance learning environment would be to create software on microcomputer disk to supplement material presented in textbooks, workbooks, and learning guides. Due to the changing nature of computer technology, it is recommended that independent study programs experiment with CAI on a small-scale basis, and monitor these courses carefully to obtain information that could be used to facilitate a full-scale CAI effort in the future. The questionnaire is appended. (MES)",

Analysis of the responses indicated that the subjects no longer view computers as a threat to their jobs; half of the respondents believed computers should be used in all subject areas and that teaching computer literacy is the responsibility of teachers on all grade levels, but more than half of them indicated a preference for traditional teaching methods; many of the respondents felt that  students enjoy using computers and should have more access to them, but only a third of them believed that students learn faster on computers; many respondents reported having received some inservice or formal training on computers, but felt that they maintained a low level of computer competence and that all teachers should be trained for computer usage. It was concluded that teachers need to understand that computers have the potential to assist in the teaching/learning process and be provided with both opportunities to acquire appropriate computer skills, and reasonable access to adequate computer facilities.

        "description":"In October and November 1986, the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory (NWREL) sponsored a series of forums for elementary teachers to share ideas about the use of computers in the classroom. During the forums, each teacher took from 15 to 30 minutes to explain how he or she taught the lesson that was being shared. The informality of the sessions allowed interaction among the participants throughout the presentations, with many ideas spinning off from the one being presented. Applications described included the use of: (1) a word processor, Magic Slate, to write and illustrate a book; (2) a database management system, PFS:File, for multicultural education; (3) a computer simulation, Island, to study geography; (4) Mastertype, courseware in an arcade game format, for keyboard  instruction; (5) the programming language, Logo, to teach basic programming skills; and (6) a database program, Book Worm, to do online book reports. Specifics such as grade, ability levels, and hardware arrangement are given for each project.

        "description":"Academic librarians who have faculty status must meet the same criteria for promotion and tenure as other faculty members, including doing research. However, library schools may not be training librarians adequately in the research skills required for entry level academic positions. In order to determine whether library schools in the United States meet their stated goals and objectives in regard to training librarians for entry level academic positions, the current catalogs of the 60 graduate library education programs in the United States accredited by the American Library Association as of October 1984 were examined. The goals and objectives stated in the catalogs were then compared to courses taught in research and statistical methods, as well as the availability of a thesis  option. Results of the study indicate that most library schools do not meet their stated goals and objectives in training academic librarians in the area of research, and it is recommended that library schools require prior training in research methods and statistical techniques for admittance, or require future academic librarians to take such courses while in library school. Statistical information is presented in seven graphs, eight references are provided, and coded information from the library school bulletins is appended. (Author/KM)",

Funded with Library Services and Construction Act funds, BALRN was designed to test the feasibility of establishing a commercial toll-free telephone referral service as a regional measure to improve access to literacy assistance, and to evaluate various elements of the referral system. Evaluation of BALRN included such considerations as the ability of the answering service operators to be sensitive and encouraging to the callers and to provide accurate and timely referrals. Based  on the evaluation, it was decided to continue the system and support it with local funds. Lessons learned during BALRN's implementation are described and final recommendations are summarized. In addition, chapters on the implementation process include discussions of the referral service, the referral process, the evaluation process, project findings, media coverage for the 800-number referral service, managing BALRN, and making the transition from federal to local funding. The text is supplemented with seven tables and two exhibits, and additional information is provided in thirteen appendices which include the BALRN questionnaire and responses, the operators interview questionnaire and responses, the BALRN data collection log, and sample public service announcements.

        "description":"The Urban Community College Transfer Opportunities Project (UCCTOP), funded by the Ford Foundation in 1984, induced LaGuardia Community College (LCC) to critically examine, systematize, and strengthen its approaches to transfer and articulation. Viewing the major barrier to transfer as students' lack of clarity about their goals and options, LCC has focused on improving transfer information and broadening transfer options. To meet students' information needs, LCC has developed: (1) a Transfer Information Guide, which assists students in selecting the best possible combination of courses for transfer purposes; (2) a Career Development Module, which introduces educational and career planning in the required Freshman Seminar; (3) a Transfer Seminar, which focuses on educational  planning, college choice, and the application process; (4) a biannual Transfer Fair, which provides students with an opportunity to discuss admissions criteria, academic programs, credit transfer, and other issues with four-year college representatives; and (5) the Career Transfer Resource Center, which offers a variety of print and computerized resources. In its attempt to broaden students' transfer options, LCC has joined with Baruch College and Queens College to develop and implement a Joint Admissions Program; established a partnership with Vassar College to give students the opportunity to experience a private, selective, four-year college setting; formed another transfer partnership with Clark College (Georgia) to encourage continued education at historically black institutions; and  forged linkages with other four-year private institutions. The impact of the UCCTOP project on LCC can be measured in terms of the number of grant activities that will be institutionalized by the end of the funding cycle, the amount of college resources devoted to the operationalization of the project, and the changes that have taken place at the college.

Study findings, based on a 57% response rate, included the following: (1) 67% of the colleges had either men's or women's intercollegiate programs with varying numbers of sports; (2) 81% were members of the NJCAA, and 89% belonged to at least one athletic conference; (3) only 25% of the CEO's felt the new rules were an  improvement, while 56% said they were worse; (4) 75% felt academic progress standards should be computed on a term rather than an annual basis to determine athlete eligibilty; (5) 48% disagreed that part-time students should be eligible for athletics and 44% agreed; and (6) 66% felt that future eligibilty rules should be more stringent, 25% felt they should stay the same, and 10% were either undecided or indifferent. Based on study findings, recommendations were developed, focusing on such areas as joint efforts by the NJCAA and the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges to obtain greater CEO involvement in policy oversight; the formation of a National Advisory Board of CEO's to the NJCAA; the formation of a single national athletics governance structure for all two-year  colleges; the incorporation of standards of academic progress into eligibility requirements; and the monitoring of part-time student athletes.

        "description":"As part of a comprehensive environmental scan prepared by Prince George's Community College (PGCC) in Maryland, this report focuses on trends in PGCC's market share, student recruitment and retention, and enrollments. The first section offers a market share analysis, examining the full-time, part-time, and new full-time undergraduate market shares of selected schools from fall 1982 to 1985; and highlighting new full-time Black undergraduate market shares. After analyzing sources of fall 1985 students, the report uses the component yield method to project fall headcount and credit hour for fall 1986 and 1987. The next section offers findings from a statewide community college study of student retention in fall 1980, 1981, and 1982, contrasting retention at PGCC with state norms  and analyzing minority student retention patterns. Finally, data displays are presented, covering: (1) market shares in terms of community college share of state enrollment, trends in full- and part-time market shares, full and part-time enrollment of county residents, enrollment of new full-time freshmen, and first-time, full-time enrollment of black students; (2) sources of students, analyzed in terms of residence and load, actual and projected enrollment of county high school graduates, and component yield method forecasts for 1986-87; and (3) findings from the statewide student retention study including data on 1980, 1981, and 1982 cohorts.

        "author":["Cross, K. Patricia"],
        "description":"The 30 or more major educational reform reports that have appeared since \"A Nation at Risk\" are in solid agreement that public education falls short of excellence. While suggestions for reform in elementary/secondary education have focused on teaching, in colleges and universities the emphasis has been more on curriculum than instruction. However, achieving excellence in postsecondary education requires an understanding of what teachers can do to cause learning. Major findings from research on teacher effectiveness can be distilled into three conclusions: (1) when students are actively involved in the learning task they learn more than when they are passive recipients of instruction; (2) students generally learn what they practice; therefore, time engaged in learning should be  related to desired instructional outcomes; and (3) if teachers set high but attainable goals, academic performance usually rises to meet expectations. Though years of research confirm that these factors are significant to student learning, researchers consistently find that such common sense practices do not exist in college classrooms. Many educators feel that assessment is the route to attaining quality in undergraduate education; however, in most states the necessary links between assessment and instruction have yet to be forged. Several methods for improving these links have been proposed, including classroom research, whereby teachers evaluate the effectiveness of their own teaching; the use of a Teaching Goals Inventory to help teachers determine whether their instructional  practices are accomplishing their instructional goals; and the development of various feedback devices to be used throughout the term to determine whether students are learning what instructors are trying to teach.

As society evolved from a primitive to an agricultural and then to an industrial stage, institutions were created to coordinate specialized functions. Education is the institution intended to provide the intellectual capital and the workforce to drive the economy of a society. The United States is in a transition from an industrial society to a complex scientific and technological society based on communications and information technology. This new society will require more sophisticated intellectual capital and a workforce that is skilled in new ways. These needs will demand the formation of new expanded relationships between postsecondary education and the economy and society as a whole. Between now and the 21st century,  education will face profound challenges. Education is the key to the formation of the intellectual capital that is needed to compete in the new global economy and to shape the future of the United States in world affairs. Reports on education indicate that the education industry must be improved at once. The question remains whether the requisite tools, intellectual capital, and will to redesign the education industry are available. (Author/LAL)",

First, introductory material describes the colloquium and its objectives, and attempts to provide an idea of the participants' emotional and deeply personal involvement in the issues and the event. After noting the interdependence of the concepts under consideration, the paper addresses the open door philosophy of the community college, arguing that without supportive programs to ensure students' success, the goal of educational equality is not achieved. Recommendations for action are presented next,  focusing on community needs assessment; intervention strategies; inservice staff development; and research needs. The next sections deal with issues and challenges related to student assessment, proposing a philosophy and definition of testing and offering recommendations for the development of comprehensive and systematic assessment programs for all students. Finally, the paper considers the role of developmental education in the community colleges, redefining the concept, identifying specific characteristics of successful programs, listing advantages of effective programs, and offering recommendations with respect to program evaluation, student-teacher ratios, ongoing staff development, comprehensive student support services, teacher qualifications, learning modes, business-industry  programs, college credit, and other areas.

Its members are also creating an academic discipline centering on the principles of instruction. The theories of this discipline have been adopted from psychology, centering on learning and motivation, and modified to reflect the belief that all sentient people can be taught. In the development of both the discipline and the profession, the WCRLA has and should continue to produce studies of the effects of its efforts, including measures both of short- and long-term retention and success, as well as current status studies, studies of program costs, and numbers enrolled. The  discipline's progress depends on the constant effort to describe treatments and demonstrate effects. By using their own methodologies and publicizing their own findings, the WCRLA and its members will further the development of a unique discipline and enhance their standing as managers of learning.

In fall 1986, 46 of the 50 colleges in the system reported enrollments of 58,642 participants in noncredit courses, representing a 7.3% increase over 1985. The colleges offered nearly 3,000 workshops, conferences, and seminars, serving a total of 68,178 participants. The colleges sponsored over 2,700 other types of community service activities, such as forums, exhibits, concerts, plays, and lecture series, with a total estimated  attendance of nearly 355,150 people. Both the number of activities and estimated attendance had declined from the previous year. In summary, the Illinois community colleges served 58,642 individuals through non-credit courses and sponsored approximately 5,700 community service activities attended by over 423,000 people during fall 1986.

Subjects were more likely to show positive reactions to the emotions of their friends than to those of their acquaintances, thus demonstrating the affective basis of early friendships. No differences were found between non-positive reactions to friends' versus acquaintances' emotions. Children more often picked as a friend demonstrated greater affective knowledge, showed more happy and angry emotional displays, helped and shared more in response to peers' emotions, and ignored more in response to acquaintances' emotions. Controversial, isolated, rejected, average, and popular children differed on emotions and reactions to peers' emotions. Observational  measures for friendship and sociometric status appear advantageous for use with children at this age. (Author/RH)",

NAEYC guideline 1C states, &quot;Teachers prepare the environment for children to learn through active exploration and interaction with adults, other children, and materials&quot;; this is a statement of a basic Montessori principle. A second Montessori principle concerning &quot;sensitive periods&quot; is reflected in the entire body of the NAEYC guidelines. A third principle common to both Montessori practice and the NAEYC guidelines is the idea of the teacher as an observer. It is concluded that, if early childhood educators intend to follow the NAEYC guidelines, they will be  behaving very much like Montessori teachers. (RH)",

Bases of concern include (1) the need for bureaucracies to create environmental limits to toxic concentrations; (2) the tendency for the burden of proof of toxic effect to lie with the afflicted; (3) the concept of a safe dose level; and (4) the influence of politico-economic considerations on decisions to improve environmental control of effluents and industrial emissions. Discussion of the currently available  evidence of toxic effects focuses on polychlorinated biphenyls, diethylstilboestrol, vinyl chloride monomer, manganese, mercury, and, extensively, lead. Recommended actions to be taken to adequately protect citizens from chemical assault are offered, and the paper concludes with an account of evidence of nuclear take-up by children living near British nuclear installations and the lack of adequate official response to such evidence.

Children who experienced English K-3 and 4-6 programs showed significant gains in knowledge about victimization and strategies for staying safe. The Spanish K-3 program had a significant positive impact for first graders. Sample data for the Spanish 4-6 program and the English programs for grades 7-9 and 10-12 did not conclusively demonstrate program effects. While children's reports of abuse apparently increased after the presentations, data on the teachers' and presenters' knowledge about general child victimization and prevention issues did not indicate a positive  effect.

Specific attention is given to the child in relation to his family, the role of the observer in containing mother/infant anxieties, and the role of the tutor and seminar members in helping the observer. The first part of the paper reports observations of a baby and his parents in order to make a clear differentiation between (1) the baby attaching himself to the mother in a way that permits introjective experiences to take place, and (2) baby &quot;holding himself together&quot; out of distress. The second part of the paper describes transformations of the identities  of all those involved in the observation/seminar, the baby and his family from the infant's eighth to sixteenth month, and the toddler's adjustment to a catastrophic change: the birth of a sibling. Throughout, the paper attempts to highlight some of the central preoccupations associated with early infantile anxieties, in particular the infant's fear of disintegration and loss of identity.

        "author":["Magagna, Jeanne"],
        "description":"Elaborating on two main styles of multiple caretaking, this paper discusses those aspects of the mother-nanny relationship which influence the optimal care of the child. A caretaking style based in denial involves obliterating, denying, and distracting the child from his painful emotional experiences, fostering &quot;the stiff upper lip,&quot; and the &quot;I can manage by myself&quot; attitude. In contrast, a style based in containment involves remaining deeply in touch with the child's emotional distress; discovering what it is about; letting the child's distress enter oneself; thinking about the child's feelings; giving the child the experience of having feelings accepted, tolerated, and supplied with meaning. In this discussion, four case study profiles illuminate the two styles. Generally, the  discussion advances the following ideas: (1) caregivers must be in touch with their own feelings, not denying them, in order to be in touch with the infant's feelings; (2) time is required to learn from the experience of being with a particular baby and to understand that baby's unique emotional responses and needs; and (3) a good nanny aligns herself with the infant's parents, fostering the child's relationships with the parents and acknowledging that she cannot replace them.

Initially 40 children 6 years of age participated in the study. Each subject was administered a serial recall task and was measured on overt rehearsal and success in the recall task. Each additionally was administered a metamemory task designed to fulfill Flavell and Wellman's 1977 classification of the constituents of metamemory. Scores were used to form three groups of subjects differing in the extent they rehearsed: &quot;producers&quot; who rehearsed on six or seven trials,  semi-producers, and non-producers. Each of these groups was divided into two; half received training and half were controls. While control subjects were tested on the serial recall task again, the experimental group was tested and instructed to rehearse. Both groups were tested a third time after a week had passed. Comparisons of pretest and posttest data suggest that rehearsal training led to lasting increases in the use of rehearsal, improved recall, and greater expressed knowledge of metamnemonic awareness. Improved recall was particularly evident among those 6-year-olds who did not spontaneously rehearse. Results contrast with findings of previous studies. (RH)",

The topic of kindergarten and literacy is discussed in terms of approaches to early reading instruction, reading readiness programs, programs integrating reading and writing with children's ideas and vocal utterances, programs emphasing  comprehension, and the characteristics of a literacy-rich kindergarten environment. Cognitive learning in early childhood education is discussed in terms of research based on a Piagetian perspective.

Each child was given eight classification tasks of two choices each. Across the entire task, six criteria were available: four with figurative aspects (color, shape, size, thickness), and two with conceptual aspects (vehicles and habitations). After accomplishing a classification task, subjects were asked to state reasons why he or she had put same things together. Behavior on each task was classified as success or failure to make a  classification. Answers of successful subjects were then evaluated on success or failure to explain the classification accomplished, and choice of criteria. Results revealed that children under six years of age were unable to find criteria to make a classification when a concept was involved. They could classify only with some directly perceived figural aspect.

Chapter 2 reports effects of the empowerment program on several school outcomes, on home-school communication, and on joint activities of parents and children.

Chapter 4 discusses the range and complexity of program impact in terms of the following topics: (1) whether the program affected children by influencing the natural ecologies of their families; (2) whether effects on child behavior can be detected and how they are causally linked; (3) how effects and processes vary for different subgroups; (4) family support as relief from stress; (5) the utility of process variables; (6) social supports as measures of program impact; (7) the reality of the empowerment process; and (8) challenging issues in the relationship between families and formal schooling.

All parties are agreed that families with children must be given a better deal in the wake of the economic crisis. But how is this to be done and how quickly can it be achieved? Is the expansion of day nursery facilities to be speeded up, or are parents to be given a care allowance which will enable one of them to stay at home? Opinions differ on this point, not only between the Social Democratic Government and the Opposition but also between the non-socialist parties. This article, after identifying crucial issues and ideological aspects of the debate in Sweden on family policy, reviews benefits provided for families in Sweden and discusses, within the context of current history, the family policy of  the major Swedish political parties, including the Social Democrats, the Moderates, the Liberal Party, the Center Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Left Party Communists. It is concluded that, since the Liberal Party's immense success in the 1985 election, most current indications point to a continuation of the debate on freedom of choice in its broad sense, at least for as long as there continues to be an acute shortage of day nursery places.

        "description":"This paper places research findings within a social learning framework to demonstrate that television influences the development of sex typing in children. First, the presence of sex-typed content in television programming and advertising is documented. Then, the nature of children's attention to and comprehension of televised messages is reviewed. Finally, behavioral effects after exposure to sex-typed television content are examined. Although children can learn both traditional and nontraditional values from television viewing, research findings clearly document that for the past 30 years, television content has overwhelmingly reinforced children for adopting traditional sex roles. Recommendations are offered for moderating these effects. (Author/RH)",

Specifically, the report presents the evaluation team's examination of conflicting claims, views, and assertions concerning the kindergarten program. Section I provides a brief description of the team's visit to the community, as well as summaries of information obtained from parents, school board members, central district staff, teachers, and principals. Section II addresses questions put to the team to guide the evaluation--questions that concerned developmental readiness, optional and regular  kindergarten programs, and needed changes. Section III discusses particular issues the team wished to highlight: (1) the practice of &quot;red-shirting,&quot; or parental withholding of 6-year-old children from first grade; (2) community competitiveness and parents' concern with their children &quot;making it&quot;; (3) curriculum issues, particularly the importance of appropriate methods of instruction; and (4) the cycle of blame allocation among the interested groups, which was considered irrelevant, potentially harmful, and capable of undermining efforts to solve the district's problems. Appended are a nearly verbatim record of participants' comments and an extensive ERIC Ready Search of 1985 and 1986 journal articles and documents about kindergarten and kindergarten children. (RH)",

Each dyad was audiotaped and videotaped while playing with play-doh or looking at a picture book for up to 30 minutes. Parental questions were coded for level of distancing strategies. A parental warmth measure assessed parental actions that expressed enthusiasm, playfulness, enjoyment of the child, enjoyment of doing something with the child, compassion, or understanding. A parental sensitivity measure globally rated parents' sensitivity  to their child's cognitive level, emotional state, and physical state. Results indicated that task situation and sex of the child influenced parental speech and interaction with their preschool children. Fathers and mothers were comparable in their cognitive demands. The task in which the dyad engaged was important in the use of distancing strategies. Sex of child contributed to differential treatment. Although all parents exhibited warmth and sensitivity, parents of daughters exhibited more warmth and greater sensitivity than did parents of sons. (RH)",

        "description":"A study was made of social representations concerning intelligence and its development among groups of parents, parent-teachers, and university students. One of the main functions of social representations is to enable individuals to master and familiarize the unknown and inexplicable and stabilize social identity. What is inexplicable about intelligence and its development resides in the direct and everyday experience of interindividual differences. Research indicates that representations of intelligence are rich in content. While it is true that the logical mathematical model of intelligence is valued, intelligence is also considered as the interiorization of social norms and values; as a manifestation of social ability; as personality traits linked with discipline, rigour,  personal commitment, and perseverance. How these themes are evident in different adult groups in relation to their level of direct experience with children is described in comparisons of parents and non-parents, parents with one and parents with two children, fathers and mothers, housewives and working mothers, and teachers with and without children of their own. Among the findings, parents, much more than non-parents, refuse any idea of the development of intelligence and prefer to think of it in terms of biological heredity. Parents with two children differ from non-parents in viewing intelligence as a gift which does not develop and is revealed through biological maturation, admitting no influence of environmental factors and, more particularly, no influence of family characteristics.

        "description":"Part of an ongoing longitudinal research project, a study was made to develop a method and a multilevel model for evaluating at its earliest stages the relationship between a mother and her child. The main hypothesis of the study was that the early mother-child relationship, consisting of maternal responses and a mother's images of her role in child rearing, is to a considerable extent based on parity, mother's personality, the state of mother's marriage, and on her experiences of parental behavior in childhood. Using a follow-up approach, the research investigated whether these factors would form a basis for predicting child development. Subjects were 309 primiparous and 182 secundiparous mothers seen 3 to 5 days after delivery. A follow-up study of the mothers and their  children (born in 1971 or 1972) was carried out immediately before the children began school in 1978 and 1979. Several psychological, and psycho-physiological tests and questionnaires were used. Step-wise regression analyses were carried out using sumscales based on factor analyses. Results supported the main hypothesis. Adequacy in mothering and intentions to show love in child rearing predicted development of goal directed, sociable, adaptive behavior. Intentions to use authoritarian control predicted development of egoistic, exasperating behavior. (Author/RH)",

Three types of stress are defined: (1) tensions arising from frustration; (2) pressure to develop; and (3) the experience of traumatic events. From an ecological perspective, sources of stress in the micro-, exo-, and macro-systems impinging on children are identified to provide an image of the complexity of stress. To avoid stress, children take typical evasive actions; these are listed  along with ways children devise to face and handle stressful events. Thirty-one signs that children are experiencing high levels of stress are listed. In conclusion, teachers are advised that they can help stressed children by removing at least one stressor, by demonstrating how coping strategies can be transferred to other life situations, by teaching new coping strategies, and by teaching children to identify and face stress.

It is argued that structural and organizational features of a classroom constrain the interaction patterns of students in such a way as to affect the probability of dyadic friendship relationships and the network of social ties that evolve within a classroom. It is further argued that the organization of instruction and the classroom climate affect clique properties. Hypotheses about the determinants of clique size, number of cliques, clique stability and the achievement, sex, and racial composition of cliques were tested on a large, longitudinal data-set containing information on fourth through seventh grade students. Results show that the formation of student  friendship cliques was more closely linked to classroom characteristics and to pedagogical practices than had previously been recognized. The processes governing the establishment of cliques changed over the school year as different features of the classroom experience became more salient to students. (Author/RH)",

The study began in March 1986 with data on 805 students who were in second grade in 1980-81. These included 490 students who were in Chapter 1 programs that year and 315 low achieving students from buildings not eligible for Chapter 1 funds. Data on achievement, attendance, retentions, and participation in other categorical programs were collected from the spring of 1980 through the spring of 1985, covering the period between the end of the students' first and sixth grades. Of six research questions, five dealt with the attainments of Chapter 1 students after they had left the program and one dealt with  the patterns of categorical services students received. Results indicated that the Chapter 1 program had a positive impact on the achievement of the participants. They also suggested that Chapter 1 students differed from low achieving students from schools with a higher socioeconomic status and tended to have multiple problems associated with low achievement that makes raising their achievement levels difficult. It is concluded that continued supportive services of some type may be necessary to raise such students' achievement. (RH)",

        "description":"Computer usage by preschool children differing in cognitive tempo was explored. Cognitive tempo refers to a child's tendency to respond slowly or rapidly in a problem-solving situation which has high uncertainty. The Kansas Reflection-Impulsivity Scale for Preschoolers (KRISP) was administered to 13 children enrolled in a prekindergarten class at a day care center. Of the sample, three children were identified as reflective (responding slowly) and three as impulsive (responding rapidly). Data were collected via a computerized observational checklist developed by the researcher. It was found that children classified as impulsive made more errors when using the computer than did children classified as reflective. When subjects were rank-ordered according to error scores received on  the KRISP and the computerized checklist, order was preserved except for two subjects. Little difference was observed in the frequency and length of computer sessions by impulsives and reflectives when compared as groups; however, much variation between individual subjects was evident. Use of the computer as an observational tool was found to have several advantages, including reduced observer bias and greater accuracy in recording observations. (Author/RH)",

Three dimensions of the processing of television advertising are assessed: ability to discriminate commercial from program content; ability to attribute persuasive intent to a commercial; and attitudinal responses to commercial appeals. Results indicated that (1) both age groups were significantly less likely to discriminate commercial from program content when the host-selling format was viewed, and (2) older  children were more favorably influenced by commercial content when it was seen in a host-selling presentation than in a normal viewing situation.

        "description":"The present study investigated relationships between cognitive components of children's sex-role development and the bases of their attributions of sex-stereotypes to a particular gender. Specifically, it was predicted that the number of sex-stereotypes children correctly attributed would be significantly related to gender differences between the figures used in the task and not to the size of the stimulus figure, children's level of gender constancy, or their sex. Further, it was predicted that highly gender schematic children would be more accurate in attributing sex-typed activities to males and females than would less gender schematic children. A total of 83 children 27 to 63 months of age completed interviews assessing (1) knowledge of sex-role stereotypes, beliefs in  stereotype flexibility, and understanding of gender constancy, and (2) toy preferences and their degree of gender schematization, and use of physical size as a basis for attributing sex-stereotypes. Results indicated that degree of gender schematization was predictive of accuracy in children's attributions of sex-stereotypes to both males and females. In contrast, stage of gender constancy was not predictive of any of the major dependent variables. It is concluded that the findings offer further evidence of the importance of gender schemata in early sex-role development. (Author/RH)",

The program, initiated in 1981, boosts technical competency of rural students to fulfill the laboratory's employment needs and helps regional economy. Laboratory scientific, technical, and support personnel conduct six types of outreach programs. Science Beginnings for grades 4-6 introduces science-related subjects to stimulate imagination. Programs for high school juniors/seniors include credit courses on state-of-the-art technology, summer programs  during which students develop/present science projects with a laboratory mentor, and annual open house for students to talk with scientists about careers and research. A summer institute for secondary school science teachers offers graduate credit. Careers in Science uses panel presentations in regional schools to encourage students in grades 7-10 to consider scientific/technical careers. Panels include people with ethnic backgrounds similar to the target community, males, and females representing jobs which require a variety of educational levels. Background information about the laboratory and region, comments of panel members and teachers, and results of a program evaluation are included. (LFL)",

Part of the Intercampus Graduate Studies program of the University of California--San Francisco School of Nursing and the University of California--San Diego School of Medicine, the model reflects concern with family health care needs in rural San Diego County. During its first year, Academic Year 85-86, the program established student preceptorships in two rural community health clinics. The university offers didactic content for preparation of the Family Nurse-Practitioner/Nurse-Midwife through its curricular program, selects students for preceptorship placement, provides faculty orientation/development for  community/clinical preceptors, provides academic faculty member site visits, and conducts program evaluation. The community health center provides resources/facilities for patient care including preceptor supervision of students and ancillary personnel/supplies and collaborates in program planning/evaluation and preceptor development. The Clinical Preceptor shares patient care sessions with a student, incorporating material specific to rural health. The model demonstrates feasibility of &quot;town/gown&quot; collaboration, promotes job selection based on realities of rural settings, and increases rural community visibility to the university community. Feasibility study results and a map and organization chart of the California Area Health Education Centers systems are included. (LFL)",

        "description":"To meet the need for educational audiologists in Hawaii schools, a cooperative program was designed to establish an educational audiology component in the existing speech-language pathology program at the University of Hawaii. Planned by the University of Hawaii, the Hawaii Department of Education, and the State Education Agency, the Hawaii-based program was needed because of the acute shortage of educational audiologists coupled with the difficulty of recruiting on the mainland. The primary goal of the program was to establish services to the hearing impaired not served by existing programs in Hawaii schools. The target population included children with auditory perceptual disturbances, those with hearing sensitivity and/or acuity disorders, and children with transient  disturbances such as otitis media. Phase I of the three-phase program is based at the University of Hawaii and covers preprofessional or basic information coursework, clinical training, and practicum experience. Phase II is the development of a model service center that provides diagnostic and evaluative services and is the referral and management center of the hearing involved children. Phase III is services to the schools, including an information network, referral center for children with suspected hearing disorders, inservice, counseling, and prescriptive diagnosis. (JHZ)",

        "description":"The delivery model of the Birth-through-Three program incorporates interlocking community-based centers with a regional agency (Little Tennessee Valley Educational Cooperative) under the administrative guidance of an advisory council. The program goal is to provide highly qualified professional services to the targeted children/families within their home communities in a cost-effective manner. A community-based center in Blount County, Tennessee, serves 15 children and one in Loudon County serves 7 children. The centers provide direct professional services and a Parent Information Center that informs, trains, and uses the skills of parents. Children eligible for the program meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) medical diagnosis associated with mental retardation; (2)  diagnosis of moderate or greater mental retardation as determined by psychological assessment; and (3) significant delays in at least two of the five targeted developmental areas. Data on the progress of each child enrolled is maintained through a pretest/posttest procedure. Data analysis shows consistently significant gains in perceptuo-cognitive, language, and gross motor skills. The program's regional cooperative administrative structure, coupled with the employment of highly qualified professional staff, appears to be a productive, cost-effective model for providing educational services to young handicapped children in rural areas.

Ninety-six school districts in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming participated. Data were compiled by source, e.g. high school student, graduate, superintendent, and by area of inquiry, e.g., school, community, and presented in 11 table sets with data broken down in 137 separate tables by factors such as states, enrollment size, degree of isolation. Comparisons also were made by  enrollment size. Schools in the study were found to be more alike than different and characteristics were consistent across the seven states. Among discovered patterns were: staff lack of advanced degrees; low number of years of tenure; lower base teacher salaries and higher district per pupil cost in smaller districts; high percentage of students/graduates planning/pursuing post-secondary education; student satisfaction with academic/career preparation and community life; and relationships between enrollment size and percent of students who take selected courses.

Figures indicate that cumulative general fund expenditures over the 5-year period were allocated to state agencies (31%), schools (14%), municipalities (11%), permanent fund deposits (10%), individuals (9%), public corporations (8%), loan funds (5%), University of Alaska (4%), debt service (3%), one-time expenses (3%), and miscellaneous grant/programs (2%). Over 30% of general fund expenditure was for expenditures that did not exist or were miniscule before 1980. Overall standard operating expenses increased  168% between 1979 and 1985. Capital expenses grew more than 800%. Biggest percentage increases in operating expenses between 1979 and 1985 were in development (+393%), general government (+206%), and transportation (+196%). The nature of state spending changed by assuming increased responsibility for municipal and school finance. The state paid more than 90% of the operating costs of expanded rural school districts and nearly 70% of city/borough school costs. The nature of revenues also shifted, with no taxes being taken from individuals after the first half of 1980. (NEC)",

        "description":"Since the advent of the 1980s, the economic viability of many farm operations has been severely jeopardized. Although attention has been directed primarily to the Midwest, in many respects farm stress has been greater in the South than in any other region. What is clear, however, is that the crisis is not strictly an agricultural one. Rather, a plethora of communities across the rural landscape, especially in the South, has been subjected to a crisis of its own. While the so-called &quot;rural crisis&quot; in the South has been an outgrowth of the changed economic conditions of the 1980s, it also has been based on deep-seated problems that have existed in the region for decades. Unfortunately, despite severe hardships facing rural areas of the South, land-grant institutions of the South  are ill-equipped to respond to the needs of these communities. Further exacerbating the situation is a federal policy that has reduced support for rural development program initiatives at state and local levels. It is argued that land-grant programs of the South must embrace a rural development initiative as part of their mission, and develop new strategies for realizing economic development and visionary leadership in rural communities of the South.

Representative Rick Boucher, author of the legislation, indicated that, while the bill would extend to Indians the same protection now governing non-Indians, it would not deprive Indian tribal courts of jurisdiction. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Victoria Toensing supported the legislation because, in conjunction with offenses currently listed in the Major Crimes Act, it would cover all defined serious sexual offenses against Indian children by Indians. Susan Shown Harjo, Executive Director, National Congress of American Indians, indicated that the  126 Indian governments she represents endorse the amendment and see it as necessary to fight the nearly 25% increase in Indian child sexual abuse that took place from 1983 to 1984. Written testimony of the Navajo Nation addressed the definition of &quot;sexual molestation of a minor&quot; and the impact on the Navajo Nation resulting from the disparities in legal standards between Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Written testimony of the American Indian Law Center concurred that the legislation is important for solving child sexual abuse. (NEC)",

Their testimony outlined the effects of the long-term agricultural depression on rural health care, examined the parallels between 1930s depression families and today's farm families, reported perceptions of farm residents regarding quality of life and levels of stress, and documented the need for mental health and other family support services. This report includes transcription of the hearing proceedings, prepared statements, letters, and supplemental materials. (JHZ)",

Major program goals are to increase high school equivalency completion rates, to enhance ability of identified extreme need adults to begin General Education Development (GED) tutoring, and to increase successful postsecondary and vocational education referral and job referral rates. Program services are coordinated by a task force that includes representatives from education, health and social services, and other tribal departments. The education director, a tutor-counselor, and an advocate-tutor provide GED and adult basic education (ABE) instruction,  counseling for postsecondary and vocational education, and assistance with job seeking. The success rate for those attempting the GED is 97%. The ABE program has more than 60 participants each year, and 96% demonstrate mastery of a majority of their academic objectives. More than 50 adult Indians receive career guidance annually, and more than 25% go on to enroll, primarily at community colleges. Included with this program description is a 24-page section of student recordkeeping forms, a community needs assessment survey form, GED and ABE skills lists, a student interest survey, and an educational development plan.

The overview notes that 11 districts of a possible 40 in the state participated in the program in 1986, with 10 summer-only and 1 year-round program. Background information explains the Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS), describes student identification and recruitment procedures, and defines eligibility. Information about migrant students includes breakdown by gender (51.82% male, 48.18% female); by migrant status (55.1% settled out, 41.02% interstate, and 3.88% intrastate); by ethnicity (76.22% Hispanic, 12.86% Indian, 7.89% Anglo, and 3.03% Asian); and by age and grade. Pre- and post-test results are  reported for the Wide Range Achievement Test by grade level for each program site. A summary of test results notes that few consistent patterns emerged from the analysis. The final section presents excerpts from observations and recommendations made by the site evaluators at each of the 11 programs. Positive observations concerned use of tangibles in early math lessons, student-made books, use of cultural materials, and the presence of staff who served as role models for students. Recommendations include using aides for instructional activities, emphasizing students' oral participation, and increasing administrative support. (JHZ)",

Student achievement growth for the SEED groups was mixed. Four classes made gains greater than the district average, four classes neither gained nor lost, and one class gained less (data from the 10th class are not included). No significant correlations were found between achievement and length of time in the project. Student attitudes did not change significantly; nearly 70% were positive both before and after SEED. The implementation plan was  difficult to accomplish, and the SEED curriculum was not integrated with the district's mathematics program. Observations indicated that students were introduced to some elements of exponentiation and were involved in enjoyable classroom activities.

Programming protocols were collected periodically and examined for errors and misconceptions; in-depth interviews were conducted in order to understand specific misconceptions better. As novice students transit from instruction to experience in LOGO, they develop a systematic set of misconceptions concerning the flow of control in programs. These misconceptions result in programming errors including unnecessary repetition of statements, inadequate use of conditional statements, non-existent or inappropriate combination of Boolean operators, failure to initialize variables, and difficulty transferring simple recursive structures developed in the graphics mode to the list  processing mode. In addition, students with prior programming experience in BASIC inappropriately attempt to superimpose the iterative FOR...NEXT loop of this language onto recursion in LOGO. The origins of these misconceptions are traced to general properties of cognition and also to specific instructional practices. Four recommendations for instructing novices in LOGO are included.

Action research is a process of systematic inquiry and of knowledge, skill, and attitude growth in which classroom teachers on either an individual or collaborative basis investigate a self-identified instructional problem and attempt to better understand and improve the teaching/learning process occurring in their classrooms. This paper's critical analysis involves a review of the issues surrounding teaching as an emerging profession, what is known about effective staff development practices, and what is emphasized in the literature on school workplace conditions in which teachers function on a  day-to-day basis. Finally, the paper reviews the potential as well as various serious dilemmas inherent in the use of action research as a staff development experience. The nature of such dilemmas are discussed in terms of certain cautions which should be noted regarding practitioner action research at this time.

Two sets of videotapes of classroom episodes were prepared, one in Hebrew and one in Dutch. These tapes were viewed by Israeli and Dutch teachers in cross-cultural settings. Teachers responded in writing and in group discussions to questions about the perceived nature of the viewed episodes and commented on the cues on which their interpretations were based. Analysis of written responses and protocols of discussions yielded insights into the nature of teachers' cues and the interpretation process in the two cultures. On the basis of the data collected, it appeared that teachers use personal cues, part of their personal knowledge, to infer  classroom meanings in cross-cultural settings. The different cues used by individual teachers represented their personal knowledge and were shaped by their own experience. (Author/JD)",

The findings of the study are reported in descriptive form by questionnaire item. The results indicated that the teachers believe the program will not necessarily improve education in Tennessee. Also, they thought that the Career Ladder would not attract more qualified individuals into teaching. However, respondents reported that the program was an incentive to remain in the  the teaching profession. Also, most agreed that the quality of instruction would be improved through the implementation of the program. A majority concluded that merit pay would cause morale problems among teachers.

Competence, collegiality, and course of study comprise the dimensions or supporting structure of the model. The dimensions of the model support a working framework of resources, strategies, and applications. Teachers, as well as students, are taught strategies for making meaningful use of knowledge. As teachers consciously focus on tactics for thinking, students begin to take on  personal responsibility for their learning; both teachers and students internalize skills which bridge the gap betwen thinking-teaching behaviors and thinking-learning outcomes.

Earning certification through the ACP requires completion of a rigorous pedagogical curriculum founded on teaching effectiveness research and on-the-job teacher training. The first phase of the ACP begins with an intensive one-week institute for teaching candidates who have met the program's content-knowledge requirements. In this phase, the candidates engage in peer-teaching with observation and evaluation by experienced teachers. Following this introductory phase, the candidates begin teaching in their home districts and attend eight monthly seminars devoted principally to classroom techniques. During the  second phase, following a full year's teaching experience, the candidates refine their teaching skills with the help of consultants. The final phase of the program requires completion of three additional graduate courses within three years of the issuance of their conditional certificates. Once these requirements are met, candidates are eligible for full certification in South Carolina. (JD)",

        "description":"The Multiple-Strategies Model offers teachers eight instructional prescriptions, which when allied with an appropriate strategy, can lead to effective teaching. The presecriptive elements are generic in nature and, therefore, can be used successfully in virtually any instructional setting. The eight instructional prescriptions include: set, opener, instructional objectives, justification, content, review, evaluation, and management. A ninth component, strategy, represents procedures for instruction selected from three or more teaching techniques appropriate to the needs of the teacher being trained, i.e., large or small group instruction, direct instruction, student team learning, individualized instruction, etc. This paper presents a brief explanation of each component of the  model.

An overview of changing trends in educational objectives illuminates the gradual development of societal attitudes on the meaning of citizenship and the definition of an educated person. The general thrust of educational aims has been a sense that, in addition to students' capacity to read and compute, educational programs should also link knowledge and skills with an understanding of, and commitment to, democratic principles and their application. Such programs begin in preschool and continue throughout formal education. They  foster individual and cultural identity and include observation of, and participation in, the school and community as part of the curriculum. Ideally, they also deal with critical issues and the world as it really is and prepare students to make intelligent decisions. Such programs depend on teachers broadly prepared in history and the humanities and involve community members as resources for program development and student involvement. Exemplary school programs should present knowledge about the historical derivation and contemporary application of democractic beliefs which are essential to the understanding of American society and its institutions.

The second strategy, attracting higher-quality entrants into teaching from the ranks of talented new college graduates and from the pool of talented persons in other jobs, considers the college freshmen pool, teacher salaries, working conditions, and hiring practices. The third strategy, raising the average performance of already-employed teachers by inducing them to upgrade or  use their capabilities more effectively by providing incentive pay, includes discussion of teacher stress, teacher isolation, incentives, and rewards. The fourth strategy, raising the average performance of already-employed teachers by providing both the inducement and the structured opportunities for them to upgrade their capabilities, considers organizational factors, opportunities for professional development, and evaluation and professional improvement.

The survey stressed the complexity and diversity of literary tasks in American society rather than using a simplistic single standard for literacy. NAEP convened panels of experts whose deliberations led to this definition of literacy: &quot;using printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential.&quot; NAEP drew a nationally representative household sample of 21- to 25-year-olds living in the 48 contiguous states in the United States. Approximately 3,600 young adults in 40,000 households were interviewed and were assessed in performing tasks such as: (1) reading and interpreting prose; (2)  identifying and using information located in documents; and (3) applying numerical operations to information contained in printed material. Major findings showed that while the overwhelming majority of young adults adequately perform tasks at the lower levels on three literacy scales (prose, document, and quantitative literacy), sizeable numbers appear unable to do well on tasks of moderate complexity. Included in the report are: (1) an overview and profiles of the estimated prose, document, and quantitative literacy proficiency of young adults at four levels of difficulty; (2) comparisons of young adults with in-school 17-year-olds; (3) characteristics of the young adults by race/ethnicity, years of education, and parental education; (4) relationships of background characteristics to  performance levels on the proficiency scales; (5) oral language results for selected samples; and (6) a final section providing a summary and conclusions.

If the score distribution is uniform and there is an equal number of items at each difficulty level, both the elements and the eigenvalues of the Pearson correlation matrix of dichotomous Guttman-scalable items can be expressed as simple functions of the number of items. Even when these special conditions do not hold, the values of the correlations can be computed easily by assuming a particular score distribution. These findings are useful in conducting research on the properties of scales. (Author)",

Anrig, ETS President, predicted that advances in cognitive psychology and technology would influence tests to serve individuals more than institutions, to help individuals learn and succeed, and to guide instruction on a continuing basis. The ETS Award for Distinguished Service to Measurement was presented to Paul Horst for his work in differential prediction, and for his contributions to psychological measurement, factor analysis, and the Psychometric Society. Nine papers were presented: (1) Changing Schools and Testing: An Uneasy Proposal by Theodore R. Sizer; (2) Cognitive Research and Future Test Design by Earl Hunt; (3)  Measurement Research That Will Change Test Design for the Future by William C. Ward; (4) Technology Advances That May Change Test Design for the Future by Dorothy K. Deringer; (5) The Integration of Instruction and Testing by Robert Glaser; (6) Redirecting a School District Based on the Measurement of Learning Through Examinations by Richard C.

        "description":"The Survey of Special Test Administrations was administered to people with disabilities concerning their responses to special testing accommodations, both for college testing and for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE). The questionnaires were developed to evaluate testing accommodations for disabled people and to obtain information on the kinds of disabilities within categories of handicap. Although there are limitations due to a poor response rate and small subgroups of respondents, the study reported high overall satisfaction with special testing accommodations. The complaints of a small minority of respondents involved the test itself and the conditions of testing, including time and space considerations. In addition, the accommodations  made for the SAT or GRE were compared with accommodations provided for other college tests. The standardized tests were offered in special versions and with extra time more frequently than were college tests. Four disability groups--hearing impaired, learning disabled, physically handicapped, and visually impaired--were found to be worthy of additional study. Age of onset of the disability was an interesting factor. Distinguishing categories were found for all disability groups except learning disabled. The GRE and SAT questionnaires and data tables are appended. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"When the three-parameter logistic model and item response theory are used to analyze Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) data, there are problems with the assumption of unidimensionality. Linear factor analytic models, exploratory factor analysis programs, and the comparison of item parameter estimates for heterogeneous and homogeneous subsets also present difficulties. A new method of assessing the dimensionality of binary data is now available. TESTFACT is a computer program which can be used to perform full information factor analysis, using the marginal maximum likelihood method to estimate reparameterized discrimination and difficulty parameters for multidimensional item response models. The lower asymptote for each item is treated as a known constant whose value is  input by the program user. TESTFACT allows a stepwise factor analysis to be performed. First a one-factor solution is performed, then a two-factor solution. The difference between chi squares for the two solutions is used to test whether the added factor is statistically significant. When TESTFACT was applied to both quantitative and verbal GMAT items, a dominant first factor and two additional, considerably weaker, factors were found. (Author/GDC)",

The instruction involved programming syntax, debugging, planning, and use of a top-down programming structure. BASIC programs of 16 to 18 lines in length were arranged in a top-down structure or scrambled to separate lines which formed coherent  procedural chunks. Students had two minutes to study the program and four minutes to write it down. Numbers of correct lines and chunks recalled were analyzed for each ability group and program version. All groups indicated greater recall of the coherent programs, especially the intermediate group. Increasing ability was associated with recall of the scrambled programs. Advanced programmers also commented that the scrambled programs did not make sense. (GDC)",

Chapter I provides the rationale for conducting a study of literacy proficiencies of young adults aged 21 to 25. The purpose and conceptual framework of the research are set against a brief discussion of prior assessment efforts. Chapter II reviews the instrumentation and methodology (focusing on the assessment design), the data collection activities, the scoring and entry of data, and the scaling of the simulation tasks. Major sections of Chapter III deal with the dimensionality of literacy skills, scaling the adult literacy tasks, and describing and anchoring the literacy scales. Chapter IV profiles  proficiencies for the total group of young adults assessed on each of three literacy scales. Chapter V compares young adults with in-school populations and describes performance at five levels of reading proficiency. Young adults are characterized in Chapter VI using three variables as a framework--race/ethnicity, parental education, and respondent's education. Chapter VII presents analyses investigating the relationship among demographic characteristics, educational variables, literacy practices and the four literacy outcome measures. The oral-language assessment is described in Chapter VIII. Appendices contain: (1) sampling, weighting, and sample error estimation; (2) scaling and scoring procedures; (3) data; (4) the background and attitude questionnaire; and (5) a list of consultants  used to develop and review assessment and exercises.

However, continuing concerns are expressed in national reports about the level of achievement, particularly in mathematics and science, and increased testing has been suggested as a means of encouraging curriculum change and evaluating student progress. Increased testing in current competency testing programs is unlikely to meet these broader goals. Two frameworks have implications for evaluating competency testing: (1) the context of assessment--testing of cognitive knowledge, learner characteristics which have an impact on instruction, and curricular validity; and (2) the meaningfulness of test scores and reports to students for self-direction, and to teachers for  instructional planning. These frameworks can further increase the links between instruction and the assessments of individual students. A three-page list of references concludes the document. (Author/GDC)",

The test was intended to identify students who require further diagnosis and remediation in order to participate successfully in ninth grade classes. Results indicated that over 90 percent of the examinees scored at or above the Statewide Level of Expected Performance (SLOEP) for the second consecutive year. Mathematics showed the greatest improvement over the previous year in average score, although there continues to be an indication of greater need in mathematics. The average score and the percent at or above SLOEP were substantially higher than the figures for the 1980 test administration. The 1985 performance of urban  students improved from the previous year in mathematics, language arts, and writing. The percent meeting or surpassing SLOEP also improved since 1980, with a 34 percent gain in mathematics. Of a total of 5,790 students in possible need of remedial assistance, 3,711 or 64 percent fell below SLOEP on only one subtest. Large cities had the highest percentage of students (37 percent) needing remedial assistance.

The three first grade units corresponded to the Developing Mathematical Processes curriculum and involved mathematical sentence writing. The goal of the set of 10 instructional units, to be conducted over the 3-year period, was for children to develop efficient problem-solving behavior in addition and subtraction problem situations. Skills leading to this behavior were the ability to symbolize verbal problems in the form of written addition or subtraction sentences, to retrieve addition and subtraction facts, and to use addition and subtraction  algorithms. Mastery of each of the instructional objectives was expected at definite times during the sequence. Matrix sampling was used to divide students into three test groups; test reliability was acceptable in all three groups and difficulty equivalent. Results indicated that students demonstrated mastery of all prerequisite instructional objectives and made satisfactory progress on the instructional topics.

The reviewers also considered the clarity and quality of the submittal itself. The program content areas most  frequently included were basic skills (reading, mathematics, and writing), career education, and special education. Approved submittals, in addition to the official seven criteria, also provided adequate descriptions of the program components. Most approvals used quasi-experimental or experimental designs, and nonequivalent or randomized control groups. Although the number of submittals decreased, evaluation designs became more rigid in more recent years. Clear writing and presentation of results appeared to be a critical factor in acceptance.

        "description":"Recently, knowledge of the mechanisms of visual-spatial attention has improved due to studies employing single cell recording with alert monkeys and studies using performance analysis of neurological patients. These studies suggest that a complex neural network including parts of the posterior parietal lobe and midbrain are involved in covert shifts of visual attention. This paper describes two experiments employing the dual task technique to determine if covert visual orienting can take place while a person's attention is engaged in a language processing task. Results show clear evidence of interference between the two tasks suggesting a common system. The results also indicate that whatever is common to the two tasks does not have the same anatomical location as found for  visual spatial attention. Previous work in cognitive psychology has also proposed a dissociation between the alerting and selective aspects of attention. In agreement with this dissociation the present study found that omitting any warning signal worsened performance for left-sided patients. These two patterns were also found in normals when we compare blocks run at a high state of alertness with those run at lower levels of alertness. These results support suggestions of a right sided bias for alerting but show that it is not the cause of the attentional selection deficit often reported in right parietal patients. A hierarchical distributed network is proposed to accommodate these data. (Author/JAZ)",

This study provides evidence for a third general factor of coordination, that of force control. Subjects that exhibit low variability in reproducing a target force with one effector, such as the finger, show low variability with other effectors, foot or forearm. In addition, ability in force control cuts across different force ranges and across situations where force is either the primary goal or of secondary importance. Force records obtained during a periodic tapping task show that, although force control is largely independent of timing, there are some interactions between the two factors. Force variation appears to slightly distort timing  in part because large forces speed up implementation of movement, thereby shortening preceding intervals and lengthening following ones, and in part because force variation alters central timing mechanisms.

        "description":"Although college faculty may hesitate to evaluate each others' teaching, it is a sensible alternative to evaluation by students or by administrators. Peer evaluations are not only useful for improving teaching, but also affect promotion and tenure decisions. When faculty are rated by observation, repeated visits and rater training are required in order to insure reliability. A qualitative approach, involving descriptions of classroom instruction based on the observer's perceptions, is preferred. Rating scales may be useful in assessing the appropriateness of course objectives, value of instructional materials, student achievement, and teacher's knowledge of subject matter. One college uses a Committee on Teaching to evaluate teaching performance. In addition to reviewing  materials presented by the instructor and describing classroom observations, the committee interviews both former and current students. Another approach to teacher evaluation, which is used by very few institutions, is a variable weight approach. Faculty members select, in advance, an area of their performance--research, teaching, or service--which would be given extra weight during that evaluation year. (GDC)",

It begins by presenting a typology of standards imposed by education decision-makers at the state, district and local level. This typology was used to identify, collect, and describe state-prescribed educational standards in effect in the 1984-85 school year. Profiles of state standards were developed for each of the 50 states, covering student standards (testing, high school graduation requirements, and attendance), teacher standards (teacher preparation, certification and relicensing, and staff development), and school and school district standards (length of school year, length of school day, curriculum mandates, and other standards). Each  state revised drafts of the profiles and provided information on curriculum mandates. Chapter 1 summarizes the policies in effect across the 50 states and changes made by the states; Chapter 2 includes the 50 revised profiles. (LMO)",

The results indicated the stepwise method was preferred because of its practical nature, when the models chosen by different selection methods were similar in number of variables, variables included, and amount of variance explained. The best subset method worked very well for these data sets, and was recommended for encouraging a non-mechanical selection process by giving many suggested models. The backward method provided a model which explained about as much variance as models chosen by any other method, but this model may have included more variables than necessary. It was not  recommended when there is high multicollinearity. The stepwise method was generally adequate except when conditions of multicollinearity, suppression, and sets of variables working jointly do not occur; then it should be used in conjunction with other methods. The forward method was not recommended if the stepwise method is available. It was concluded that the best subsets and backward procedures were the best, and that the stepwise and forward methods should never be used alone in selecting a model. (GDC)",

        "description":"Factor analysis is the traditional method for studying the dimensionality of test data. However, under common conditions, the factor analysis of tetrachoric correlations does not recover the underlying structure of dichotomous data. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the factor analyses of tetrachoric correlations is unlikely to yield clear support for unidimensionality even when the data are generated to be unidimensional. This result is caused by a failure of the item data to meet the assumptions of the tetrachoric correlation. For this study, item true score distributions were generated assuming a normal latent trait and a variety item characteristic curve (ICC) forms for the items. In every case, these distributions were nonnormal, and the bivariate distribution  did not match the bivariate normal. The principal component analysis of data generated according to these ICC's yielded a highly complex solution, most likely a result of the violation of the assumptions of the tetrachoric correlations that form the basis of the analysis. Further research is needed on new methods of factor analysis of dichotomous test data generated by a variety of ICC forms. (BS)",

        "description":"A dichotomous dependent variable is used to determine a combination of variables that will predict group membership. Dichotomous variables are frequently encountered in multiple regression analysis. However, several textbooks question the appropriateness of using multiple regression analysis when analyzing dichotomous dependent variables. The critics state that in addition to the predictions made by the regression equation with a dichotomous dependent variable, the statistical tests are also invalid. This paper assesses the meaning of the charges against multiple regression and deals with some logical extensions of them. Data from the A3 data set in Gunst and Mason is used to examine the criticisms by comparing results of cases viewed as appropriate by critics with cases viewed  as inappropriate for one predictor and two predictor examples. As the tests of significance are identical whether the dichotomous variable is independent or dependent, critics must deal with all significance testing with t-tests, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, discriminant analysis, and any use of dummy variables in multiple regression if they are to be taken seriously.

Basic principles of psychometric theory led to the development of respected intelligence tests and large and comprehensive testing and assessment programs. This paper synthesizes major developments in psychometric theory, focusing on the issues of reliability and validity. The synthesis is developed from: (1) Cattell's basic data relation matrix (BDRM) of 10 coordinates for describing psychological events and the reliability and generalizability (Cronbach) coefficients derived from it; (2) the four box conception of data (predictor, criterion, experimental treatment, and nonexperimental treatment) to depict psychological  research problems; and (3) a hierachical version of Brunswik's lens model in which correlations between boxes can only be optimal under conditions of good reliability and symmetry.

        "description":"This paper outlines the current state of knowledge about how intellectual competence is acquired. Implications resulting from recent changes in the psychology of learning and development are beginning to revitalize the science of learning and instruction. Four broad topics illustrate the links between instructional experiments, fundamental research on learning and thinking, and potential applications to the science of instruction: (1) understanding natural language; (2) learning to read; (3) developing mathematical competence; and (4) problem solving, intelligence, and learning abilities. Major themes emerging from research in language processing indicate that prior knowledge is essential in constructing meaning for a new text and that the construction of meaning centrally  involves inference. Two main themes in reading research are emphasized: (1) the active interplay between expectations and the visual stimuli of printed words; and (2) the central role of automatic processes of word recognition. Special problems arise when analyzing mathematics as a domain of cognition and learning, including organizing schemata, recognizing persistent and systematic errors, and linking symbols and their referents. Recent work in problem solving is focused on performance in information-rich domains. There has been considerable effort in recent years to reanalyze the constructs of intelligence and aptitudes in terms of cognitive processes and constructs, including metacognitive skills. Directions for further research are suggested. (LMO)",

This paper explains the instrumental role of help-seeking in learning. Major conceptualizations of help-seeking are examined and evaluated for their utility in understanding help-seeking in school-aged learners. Cognitive, developmental, and motivational characteristics of the help-seeker are discussed, as well as situational and contextual characteristics of the helping interaction. A reconceptualization of help-seeking that emphasizes its adaptive and instrumental functions in achievement activities is outlined. The role of instrumental help-seeking across the developmental span from infancy  to adulthood is illustrated in the context of parent-child and peer relations, and in formal and informal learning situations. Prior research on the development of skills relative to help-seeking is reviewed. The impact of situational variations in the learning and achievement setting of the classroom is discussed, and ideas for future research are suggested.

Like the architect, the evaluator faces a problem of finding forms that best fit a partially defined set of contextual demands. The context is the set of all factors which made demands upon the final design form. Like the architect, the evaluator's design comes out of an analysis of the context. The evaluator's working plan corresponds to the architect's sketches. The form and the product of evaluation design are not really physical. The ultimate work is to communicate, inform, educate, inspire or to produce a beneficial impact upon the appropriate people. By constantly monitoring what is happening during the evaluation, the evaluator can continually update the working plan and flexibly  adjust the design to respond to what is needed. Out of the general nature of the design process, the following guidelines are extracted: (1) begin by not knowing what to do; (2) begin with what is happening; (3) work from the general to the specific; (4) use both analytic and integrative modes of thinking; (5) formulate general questions to guide the evaluation; (6) use evaluation methods flexibly; and (7) monitor, recycle, and rethink.

The process consists of the following steps: (1) analyzing the problem context; (2) asking a few general questions; (3) selecting the methods (strategies) to use; and (4) selecting the specific techniques (tactics) to use. To operate successfully the evaluator needs to know many different kinds of methods, understand their purposes, appreciate their limitations, and use courage and imagination. While method reflects the strategies of the evaluator, techniques reflect the tactics. Techniques are specific and can be viewed as tools. They are used for gathering and analyzing data. The following conclusions are made about the planning and implementation of an evaluation: (1) the evaluation problem is undefined  (there is no one unique solution); (2) successful evaluation design cannot be prescribed (at best, a few heuristics may prove useful); (3) the power and flexibility of the evaluator is increased as his or her repertoire of methods and skills increases.

        "description":"Criticism is the art of disclosing the qualities of events or objects the connoisseur perceives. Criticism is not negative appraisal, nor a list of unfavorable judgements; its essence is illumination. The key characteristics of criticism used as an evaluation method are: (1) inherent subjectivity; (2) reliance on the perception of the critic (its quality is a function of that person's ability); (3) descriptive, interpretative, and evaluative qualities; and (4) intent to educate others so that their appreciation and understanding of the critiqued work will be enhanced. Criticism techniques should be used when: (1) the purpose of the study is to convey to others the nature and qualities of a program or a set of materials; (2) an expert opinion can illuminate and educate others  about the program; (3) the intent of the evaluation is to discover what the program is, how it is what it is, rather than what it does; and (4) a subjective and qualitative appraisal of a program is satisfactory.

This guide considers two levels at which the understanding of the nature and methods of narrative writing, or storytelling, can be of use to the evaluator. The highest level is to use the notion of narrative as an overall framework for an evaluation which consists of content and existents. The events are composed of action and happenings, and the existents of characters and settings. The second level considers the use of specific narrative techniques, such as vignette, dialogue, quotes, and portrayal over time. Simple guidelines outlining the qualities of effective writing--clarity, force and flavor--are given. (JAZ)",

Five demands parents can make to school officials are: (1) insist that authorities provide parents with information; (2) demand an end to the use of grade equivalency scores; (3) insist that test scores be reported with scrupulous accuracy; (4) insist that schools develop fair and accurate ways of evaluating students' reading skills; and (5) insist that tests be stripped of their mystery and that there be  open discussion between school and parents about testing.

The Box-Jenkins approach, a three-stage procedure consisting of identification, estimation and diagnosis, was used to select the most appropriate stochastic model for describing undergraduate grade point average. The findings, based on a half-century of data from two universities, showed that meaningful mathematical models can be created to describe the time series of changes in the yearly grade point average. The models are tentative because of the small number of available observations and their relative complexity. A mathematical description of the time series of grades is  complex enough to suggest that no simple answer may suffice. The data appears to be best modeled by an approach that postulates random shocks persisting for only a finite time, yet each of which can be represented as an exponentially weighted average of all previous observation.

        "description":"Learner Verification and Revision (LVR) has been part of Florida's instructional materials adoption process since 1974, when state statutes required textbook publishers to provide written proof that their materials were revised based on student feedback before publication. Publishers were also required to collect student data and make revisions during the entire market life of the product. In 1983, the LVR guidelines were made more specific and required that the LVR be submitted by publishers prior to submitting textbooks for adoption. The current 1985 Florida LVR guidelines required four sections: (1) product background information; (2) intended learner outcomes; (3) prepublication LVR--overview of LVR process, data collection and use, instruments used, and sample revisions; and  (4) post publication LVR--plans for further data collection. Training was provided for publishers, and state instructional materials councils felt it was easier to evaluate the reports. Publishers, however, expressed concerns about the cost of field testing an entire textbook, validity and reliability of students' feedback, paperwork, and lack of evidence validating LVR. In light of these problems, it was recommended that the guidelines be reviewed, that publishers work with authors in implementing LVR, and that guidelines be applied more consistently. (GDC)",

        "description":"This paper examines some ethical problems that arose in a study of secondary curriculum, where educational criticism was used as a primary research strategy. A study on the subject of curriculum consonance was conducted in three tenth-grade history classrooms. In its original design, the study was primarily concerned with the correspondence between the intended, actualized, and experienced curricula. Unanticipated problems of an ethical nature began to arise during fieldwork. The ethical aspects of educational criticism are discussed in four parts: (1) background issues and the context of the study, which facilitate the comprehension of the ethical problems that eventually developed; (2) questions about the extent to which informed consent was obtained, and its implications for  safeguarding anonymity of informants; (3) what was disclosed, and to whom; and (4) ethical problems created by negative disclosures, informed consent, and the form of the reporting. It is concluded that these problems are of great importance in qualitative inquiry and are exacerbated in significant ways in the conduct of educational criticism. There are no formulaic solutions to ethical problems--they seem endemic to criticism as a form of inquiry. An appendix includes the memorandum sent to participating teachers. (JAZ)",

The following four ways in which artistic and scientific approaches are different are discussed: (1) the language of disclosure in an artistic study is one where form and content are complementary, whereas in social science the language is value-free and dispassionate; (2) goals of scientific research are to advance scientific information, while in an artistic inquiry the goal is to improve educational practices; (3) the perspective in artistic research is normative and  descriptive, while scientific studies focus on appraisal; (4) ethical difficulties, which are unlikely to occur in scientific approaches, are encountered often in artistic practices. The conclusions are made that artistic and scientific approaches serve somewhat different purposes and provide various perspectives and that artistic approaches are an important complement to the existing ways of seeing the educational world.

        "description":"This study examines the relative value of five empirical procedures for determining cutscores in placement of entering college freshmen. Placement test scores were obtained for all students entering in the fall, but tested in the summer of 1983 at a midwestern community college. Students who took at least one placement test in arithmetic, algebra, or English and who enrolled in at least one of the several freshmen courses were included in the study. The methods chosen were the lowest &quot;C,&quot; the equal percentile, and three regression procedures. These procedures derive various cutscores, and this study looks at what placement distributions would have occurred if each procedure's cutscore had been rigidly applied. Relative value is determined by the percentage of true placements  versus false placements. In addition, each method is compared with and without the inclusion of students who withdrew from courses. Results indicate limited utility for the lowest &quot;C&quot; and the equal percentile procedures. The two regression lines developed by regressing placement scores on grades (the criterion measure) and by regressing grades on placement scores were unstable across tests. The &quot;average&quot; regression line of these first two produced the most stable (across tests) cutscores and the most acceptable ratios of correct to incorrect placements. (Author/JAZ)",

While previous investigations have indicated that measures of reasoning development are associated with measures of achievement, few such studies have attempted to control for differences in scholastic aptitude. In this particular investigation, the performance of 213 middle grades students on a test of formal reasoning was analyzed in relationship to scores on tests of achievement and scholastic aptitude. Results support cognitive reasoning as a significant determinant of achievement test performance when considered alone but not when controlling for scholastic aptitude. Results suggest that performance on  reasoning tests is related to performance on achievement tests in a fashion very similar to performance on scholastic aptitude tests. Results further encourage middle grades educators to consider students' levels of reasoning when planning instruction. (Author/JAZ)",

The paper is divided into three main sections: evidence for domain-specific learning, evidence for domain-independent learning, and implications for developmental theory. The domain-specific section uses evidence from three areas of research to show that previously acquired knowledge affects the learning of subsequent, related information. In the section on domain-independent learning, it is argued that at least some aspects of learning may be relatively domain independent. This argument  is supported by demonstrating that training children to use metacognitive skills allows the transfer of these skills from one domain to another. In the last section, three prominent developmental theories (learning theory, Piagetian theory, and the &quot;capacity&quot; theory of information processing) are examined. A knowledge-based theory is presented to explain development in terms of the amount of factual and strategic knowledge that an individual has acquired. The theory argues that it is the unequal distribution of this knowledge that accounts for the apparent differences in children's and adult's reasoning processes. An eight-page reference list concludes the document. (JAZ)",

The report concludes with the following lessons: (1) reliance on the brokerage model means depending on the services available in the community; (2) the longer teens stayed in the program the better they did, so no maximum length should be established; and (3) younger mothers need a greater mix of, and different, services than older mothers.

This evaluation focuses on innovations in service delivery and the operation of sites added after the program's original inception. Sites located in communities were better able to recruit and serve out-of-school teens than agencies located within schools. Both types of sites were able to recruit a sufficient number of community women to match to the teens. Teens at the newer sites participated in program activities more frequently than those at the original sites, but the amount of  time they spent in the program was shorter. Employment-related services were diversified and enriched in the second demonstration. Some sites had difficulty convincing potential funders that Redirection's activities and the funding agencies' goals were sufficiently close to merit support, but the collaboration of the program sites with the community foundations proved to be a productive strategy in advancing toward the goal of more permanent funding. It was concluded that key elements of Project Redirection can be adapted to existing school-based programs and can be offered in rural as well as urban communities. (KH)",

A lack of congressional consensus on these issues has led to bitter debate, administrative confusion, and a lack of policy coherence. Part II discusses the following topics in greater detail: (1) enactment of a program of aid to dependent  children; (2) adoption of the concept of &quot;self-support&quot;; (3) &quot;unemployed parents&quot; introduced to the program; (4) the public welfare amendments of 1962; (5) expansion of the work incentive concept; (6) enactment of the work incentive (WIN) program; (7) welfare reform and welfare expansion during the Nixon era; (8) legislation for employment-related demonstration projects; (9) Carter's welfare reform proposal--basic issues reemerge; (10) efforts to authorize job search and changes in the WIN program; and (11) the Reagan Administration--renewed emphasis on work requirements.

Local dropout rates were compared to those of other school districts and the nation as a whole. A dropout was defined as any student who is under age 18 and has not graduated from high school and is not attending any public school or otherwise receiving an education pursuant to law for the full term of the school district in which he or she resides. The student who is absent for 20 consecutive days and for whom no other school has requested his records is also considered a dropout. The OCPS recorded a 2 percent dropout rate at the middle schools, a 10.9 percent rate at the high schools and an over-all  rate of 6.6 percent. Students most likely to drop out were American Indians or Whites. The most frequent time to leave was in the ninth or tenth grade and the highest numbers left in November or February. Almost identical numbers of males and females dropped out. Slightly over half of the dropouts were from families with a lower socio-economic background. The most frequent reason for leaving was a lack of interest in school. Achievement scores of dropouts indicated a history of below average achievement. (PS)",

        "description":"The reading scores of urban disadvantaged students have risen over the past 15 years, which may be attributable to special programs which have focused on strengthening the rudimentary skills. Whether reading achievement is dependent on students' mastery of standard English is an unresolved issue, but a number of instructional methods have been developed to alleviate the problems that dialect speakers may experience without necessarily stigmatizing students or coming into destructive conflict with the students' social and cultural difference. One method is to create stories from the children's oral language so that the reading material reflects their syntax, vocabulary, and sentence structure. Research indicates that what is most important to effective reading programs for all  students is: quality of teachers and their belief in the students' ability to read; their creation of a literate, stimulating environment, and their commitment of a significant amount of \"engaged\" time to active reading instruction. Reading develops out of students' skills in speaking and listening, and is helped by practice in writing. Because students' background knowledge determines how easily they will grasp the meaning of what they read, they should be deliberately prepared for the reading assignment. Discussion before and after reading exercises can be crucial. Ability grouping may not be advantageous for the instruction of low ability students. (KH)",

It presents a profile of dropouts including the following characteristics: (1) low socioeconomic status, (2) poor school performances, and (3) in-school delinquency. It also addresses the reasons students give for dropping out. The data provide a picture of dropouts very close to that of non-college-bound adolescents who complete high school. Institutional characteristics seem to account for the separation between stay-ins and dropouts. In the typical high school where many drop out, teachers are not particularly interested in students and the discipline system is perceived as neither effective nor fair. The effects of dropping out on self-esteem and locus of control are  seen as outcomes of formal schooling, dependent rather than independent variables. This report sees student and school interacting to produce dropouts, with schools having a responsibility to respond to students who are at risk. Three general policy reforms are recommended: (1) an enhanced sense of professional accountability among educators toward all students, (2) a renewed effort to establish legitimate authority within the institution, and (3) redefining school work to allow more students to achieve success and satisfaction.

Those groups shown by previous research to be most likely to drop out were found to be least likely to return to their diploma requirements. The following factors characterized this high-risk group: (1) Black or Hispanic ethnicity; (2) below-average socioeconomic resources, (3) poorer test scores; (4) living in the West and Midwest (vs. the South and Northeast); and (5) living in rural or urban areas (vs. suburban areas). In general, male dropouts were more likely to return and  finish high school than females (except among Whites, where they were equally likely). Among dropouts, those who completed diploma requirements were more likely to have done the following: (1) enrolled in postsecondary educational institutions; (2) enlisted in military service; or (3) obtained full-time employment. Dropping out is a reversible decision; this report concludes that there are good chances for success in working with dropouts to complete their schooling.

        "description":"This hearing was held to review the Labor Department's proposed closing of six Job Corps centers and elimination of 1,200 training slots to meet Gramm-Rudman-Hallings budget cuts. The proposed cuts will prevent 2,500 youths from participating in Job Corps training. The program, designed for disadvantaged youth and in existence for 20 years, has been successful in providing job training, remedial education skills and job placement. It is cost efficient, returning $1.38 for every $1 expended for trainees. In addition, the Labor Department estimates it would save $4.1 million in closing costs by not closing the centers. Statements of 18 witnesses are included. Though most witnesses supported retention of the Job Corps centers, questions about the following also arose: 1) capacity of  centers; 2) funding; 3) management; 4) distribution of openings; 5) center ratings; 6) comparison of Job Corps programs and programs of Civilian Conservation Centers; 7) close out costs; 8) construction and renovation needs and costs; and 9) female participation. The report includes information on program effectiveness and probable results of slot reductions. (PS)",

Chapter 1 contains an introduction to the handbook, a glossary, a section describing a practical approach to vocational preparation, and a guide to using the handbook. Chapter 2 is a diagram of a planning framework. Chapters 3 through 7 concentrate on the five elements of planning: objectives, design, action, evaluation, and future developments. The focuses of the chapter on objectives are the scope of vocational preparation, potential participants/trainees, educational/training priorities, relationship to the labor market, and relationship to local political, educational, social, and community initiatives. Chapter 4 on design considers organizational structures and  staffing, funding and resources, and activities. Chapter 5 on action discusses setting up administrative and management systems; selection, induction, and training of staff; and selecting participants. Chapter 6 proposes a means of providing self-evaluation. The three components of this approach to evaluation are addressed: description, assessment, and judgment of value. In Chapter 7 on future developments the focus is on planning for change prompted by changed circumstances or the initiative's evolution. Lists of readings, of publications of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, and of useful addresses are appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"The secretarial instructional programs at Florida community colleges and area vocational-technical centers were reviewed to determine the actions that are needed to enable the programs to meet current and future demands for secretaries who are competent in the use of advanced office systems technology. Data for the review were drawn from a secretarial futuring conference, professional business education literature, and from existing data bases dealing with secretarial instruction and its outcomes in Florida. The review findings substantiated two concerns. First, it became apparent that secretarial programs will require additional resources and development if they are to keep pace with the technological changes that now characterize the field. The second major concern that emerged  from the study was that, although there will likely be a shortage of trained secretaries in the future, sectretarial work remains a low-status, low-paying occupation. This will likely prevent secretarial instructional programs from attracting a large pool of highly motivated or academically well prepared students. Extensive updating of equipment and facilities, faculty and staff, and curriculum and instruction will be required to address these problems. More effort must also be put into marketing secretarial instructional programs. (Appendixes to this report include the secretarial conference announcement and agenda, sample references, and unit and total cost breakdowns of statewide instructional resource needs for community college and district postsecondary occupations programs.)

        "description":"A study examined ways of improving the response rates of employers to followup surveys collecting information on graduates of community colleges in Florida. Followup study procedures and instruments that had been used in the state were modified to provide for greater faculty involvement in placement of students and identification of employers and to encourage greater employer contact and response. The new survey form was shortened to fit on one side of a regular letter-sized page. Although the state-mandated questions had to be retained verbatim, the form was changed by presenting the questions in larger print and with bolder subtitles. The cover letter was also improved in the following ways: information was presented in a straightforward manner, the simplicity and importance of  completing the form were stressed, and the previous introductory rhetorical question was replaced by a positive statement. Although the results of using the new form and procedures were not dramatic (an improved response rate of 57.4 percent, they did represent a substantial improvement over the previous rate. Furthermore, the procedure of addressing letters &quot;To the Supervisor of . . .&quot; rather than restricting mailings to those supervisors whose names had been supplied by students added 104 employers to the survey population and resulted in 47 additional responses.

They were compared with those who did pursue postsecondary education. The study used the base year (1980) and first followup (1982) of seniors in the High School and Beyond Study. Findings showed 34 percent of high school graduates are terminal degree graduates; over half had postsecondary education plans. Most shifted their educational plans, generally downward. They came from lower social class backgrounds than postsecondary education students, had lower aptitude, came from larger families, and were less likely to have siblings in college. They had lower self-concept scores, experienced less parental and teacher  influence, and had parents much less likely to expect their child to attend college. They were less likely to be in the academic curriculum, had lower grade point averages, did less homework, were involved in fewer extracurricular activities, and were more delinquent. Two years after graduation they were more likely to be employed, worked more hours, and earned more. They were more likely to be married and have children and to be in clerical, crafts, operative, service, and labor/farmer occupations. (Twenty-two tables are appended.) (YLB)",

These fees were paid by sheltered workshops that employed blind or other severely handicapped individuals and produced goods and services under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act. The study focused on procedures established by the Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped to review the commission fee, the reasonableness of a 4 percent fee, and NIB's and NISH's use of funds generated by the fee. Considerations in arriving at an adequate fee were projected sales of goods and services by sheltered workshops, NIB's and NISH's past expenditures and projections, NIB's and NISH's anticipated growth,  and the need for NIB and NISH to maintain cash reserves. The method for reviewing the commission fee was found appropriate and the Committee's decision to retain the current ceiling of 4 percent on the fee was not found unreasonable. NIB and NISH provided technical assistance to sheltered workshops and expenditures were for developing new products and services, monitoring workshop compliance with Javits-Wagner-O'Day regulations, and determining production costs of workshop goods and services.

The problems of the extension program in developing nations are inherited and related to the manner in which the extension service is organized and delivers services to clients. Generally speaking, the following problems are associated with unsuccessful extension services in developing countries: lack of a formal functional relationship between extension and relevant educational institutions, a top-to-bottom-based program planning process, a lack of unified job descriptions for extension workers, and an inefficient  support system. The following strategies should be adopted to address these problems: (1) extension programs should be linked with institutions similar to the U.S. land-grant universities, (2) program planning should start at the local level, (3) extension agents should avoid nonextension activities, and (4) an extension support system focusing on information should be developed.

        "description":"A detailed review of research was conducted on the relationship of social support of older adults to their general health and well being, and the findings were applied to educational outcomes and performance. The following dimensions of social support were examined: (1) an ecological framework or perspective of social support, (2) definitions and theoretical perspectives, (3) methodological concerns, (4) social support and overall adult adaptation (focus on health ), and (5) social support and educational outcomes for older adults. The findings on the nature of social support were equivocal, pointing out a great many false assumptions and methodological problems in considering the health and well being of older adults. For example, some studies suggest that social supports  decline with age, while others suggest that the patterns of social support reside with the individual and are relatively constant throughout life. The picture of the lonely, friendless older person may be largely a myth. Therefore, applying the results of such research to educational outcomes is, at best, merely suggestive. On the one hand, educational outcomes for older adults may be somewhat independent of social support variables and influenced primarily by self-characteristics. On the other hand, the role of social supports in the educational outcomes of older adults may be relatively important but not fully appreciated. The study suggests a model of social support in older adult education. The notion of \"convoys\" or the dynamic networks of social support that accompany the individual  throughout life may be useful in such a model. Such a notion is the first step toward integrating social support theory and research in older adult education. A 66-item reference list concludes the document. (KC)",

        "description":"The Technical and Further Education (TAFE) school-to-work transition program for youth between the ages of 15 and 19 is reviewed in this report. The study examines the program with respect to the context of youth unemployment; development of curriculum objectives; work experience in transition courses; students and staffing; special programs for women, migrants, Aborigines, and disabled persons; levels of administration; the interrelation of the Commonwealth Employment Service and TAFE; transition and the community; accreditation, articulation, and employment; and evaluation. Each of these considerations is the subject of a separate chapter and each chapter ends with a summary and recommendations. The final chapter, on curriculum design, offers 19 recommendations arising from  other chapters and pertaining to developing an ideal curriculum for a transition program. According to this list, the ideal transition curriculum should give target groups extensive information concerning program aims and offerings; aim to inform and empower students socially, culturally, economically, and politically; explore students' prior knowledge and experience and incorporate these into the program; be integrated with rather than isolated from the context of the local community; use a holistic approach; stress collaborative and collective learning situations; include adequate student and teacher orientation programs; and seek staff who are empathetic with as many target group characteristics as possible. It is concluded that the TAFE transition program has in many ways been a  remarkable response to the social dilemma of youth unemployment and offers a useful basis for future efforts. (A 13-page bibliography and the 1981 guidelines for commonwealth school-to-work transition programs are appended.) (MN)",

        "description":"A project was conducted to design and pilot a scheme for monitoring trade/industry/commerce technological changes and reporting them to Technical and Further Education (TAFE) teachers and authorities. A matrix of information categories was used to facilitate the collection and storage of information relative to technological advancements in the building, furniture, and plastics industries. The monitoring involved extensive literature searches and exchanges between industry contact persons and specialist technical monitors. Items were selected from among the information gathered and were published in the form of an illustrated news bulletin entitled Tech Info. The bulletin was distributed to 430 trade and technician building studies teachers throughout Australia for evaluation.  Although responses to the questionnaire accompanying the bulletin were encouraging, their number was insufficient to draw any firm conclusions. It was discovered, however, that (1) a central library is very important for a monitoring scheme, (2) there are numerous advantages associated with beginning with an across-trades information-gathering approach and then resorting information into narrower categories, (3) cluster categories could be even more useful given a national agreement on nomenclature, and (4) an editorial group is essential to monitoring and reporting and should include a monitoring coordinator. (Appendixes include the first issue of Tech Info, the questionnaires sent to TAFE teachers and authorities, an information matrix, schemes for monitoring technology and  technological change and reporting to TAFE personnel, and a bibliography).

The research team conducted a literature search, obtained completed questionnaires from 10 colleges offering a total of 22 PEPs, visited an additional 6 PEPs, and observed 10 PEPs. Information was gathered about the 1985 level of provision of information technology training in PEPs in Australia and similar initiatives abroad, and a curriculum framework for providing information technology training to PEP participants and similar target groups was developed. Besides developing the present report, the project staff also published an annotated information technology resource guide for  PEP teachers and a description of an overseas initiative that is applicable to Australia. The curriculum recommended as a result of the study consists of an information technology core and bridging information technology courses for selected industries and related mainstream study. The theory portion of such courses should cover basic information technology terminology and processes, basic computer hardware and software structure, the history of information technology, and information technology awareness. Practical topics to be addressed include keyboard skills, terminal and microcomputer operations, use of modems and software packages, and elementary programming.

        "description":"A study examined whether there were any differences in the performance of apprentices trained in off-the-job, on-the-job, or in-plant training programs. A 1984 apprentice intake sample of over 500 apprentices and information supplied by 16 in-plant training centers and 9 colleges were used to collect data on the job performance of apprentices in the following trades: fitting and machining, electrical, sheet metal, and motor mechanics. Because of problems with program variations and training pattern inconsistencies, no effective measure could be devised to compare the performance of electrical occupations and motor mechanics apprentices placed in different types of training programs. With respect to fitting and machining, however, apprentices at off-the-job training centers  developed higher levels of practical skills, and accelerated apprentices attached to training centers showed higher levels of skill development than did their nonaccelerated counterparts. In sheet metal, on-the-job apprentices generally worked faster than training center apprentices on their college modules. Thus, it was recommended that more accelerated training programs involving close liaison and cooperation between training centers and colleges be developed. (Appendixes include the mathematics, reading, fitting and machining modules, and practical electrical tests used in the project, the observation and interview schedule, a fitting and machining two-way analysis of variance, and study recommendations based on 1983 appendice intake.

The skills and performance standards required of information technology training in the printing, tourism, banking, construction, and computer industries were identified. Next, the current provision of such training in Australia and the United Kingdom was compared, and the costs and benefits of the major options for providing information on technology training in Technical and Further Education (TAFE)-based courses were analyzed. It was determined that practical training in information technology should be included in the off-the-job component of all traineeships. Two across-industry traineeships should be developed in the electronic office and in computing and  software. All programs developed should address core skills required for personal development and future employment, practice skills in common use over a wide range of occupations, and job-specific skills. Grants should be made available to fund inservice teacher training, purchase of basic information technology equipment, and first-year evaluation of all new training programs developed.

        "description":"A study examined the decision-making stage in the curriculum development process in vocational programs throughout Australia. Data were collected from interviews from a network of persons currently involved in curriculum development and case studies of the curriculum development process in action at 16 vocational schools throughout Australia. Although information on curriculum options was found to exist within the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) agencies, biases and knowledge gaps were discernible in the case studies. Although many curriculum decisions are predetermined by outside factors, such as industrial award agreements, it appeared that other decisions were being made without proper assessment of the options available. Particular confusion existed on issues such as  the use of modules, self-pacing, and mastery learning. There was a very uneven awareness of entry and exit issues, articulation, and flexibility of testing; and the options of distance education and degrees of individualization were virtually neglected. Thus, the data indicate that curriculum developers, especially the less experienced ones, need a better grounding in curriculum issues and the curriculum options open to them. At least some curriculum developers need more guidance and more confidence in the art of choosing which data are needed to make more effective decisions. Little guidance in anticipating or dealing with the hidden forces of the curriculum process currently exists. (The instrument used in interviewing curriculum developers is appended, and 71 references are listed.)  (MN)",

        "description":"A study examined the measures taken in seven colleges in the Hunter Region of New South Wales to promote the entry of women into nontraditional trades. Questionnaires were given to all female apprentices in nontraditional trades and a random sample of male apprentices in the same trades in 1983; all female apprentices who withdrew from training in these trades during 1981, 1982, and the first half of 1983; and all teachers in these trades who had females in their classes during 1983. Females did not face any more problems than males with mathematics in the trades. However, they received less information about career options than males before entering the male-dominated trades. Harassment was a problem for a significant number of female apprentices, with harassment and unfair  treatment being more of a problem at work than at school. Male hostility toward women entering trades in which high male unemployment rates exist was also evident. Female apprentices faced particular problems in their access to and experience in nontraditional trades because of beliefs about the role of females in society, and certain practices designed to reduce these problems created the appearance of giving females special attention, thereby leading to even greater negative consequences for the women. Thus, when developing strategies to increase the access of females to nontraditional trades, policymakers and educators must realize that any strategy will have both positive and negative effects.

        "description":"The role of small business and entrepreneurship in today's economy is well documented. Entrepreneurship and small business ownership are an especially attractive option for women. Women have been seeking an escape from traditional, low-paying, dead-end jobs by choosing entrepreneurship at a rate five times faster than that of men. Women now own almost 26 percent of small businesses in America, and the number of female-owned firms in the United States rose 75 percent between 1977 and 1983. Over 91 percent of female small proprietorships fall into the categories of service, retail, finance, real estate, or insurance compared with 73 percent of all sole proprietorships. Education has a key role to play in educating women in the skills and the options of business ownership from the  time they are young girls. Programs are especially needed in the following areas: management education (the operation of the free enterprise system, basic business skills, math and risk taking, and money management); marketing, particularly selling and negotiating skills; and business capitalization and financial management. Although federal, state, and local policymakers have already begun to recognize the potential of entrepreneurship as an economic development resource for women, the message has been slow in reaching educators. It is especially important for educators to develop better career orientiation material that reflects the rapid labor market changes taking place, to introduce more female role models with high-growth businesses as speakers, and to develop case studies and  materials featuring female business owners.

In particular, the continually increasing demands for technical training and retraining have created an increased demand for continuing education for engineers throughout their working lives. The National Technological University (NTU) represents one innovative method of meeting the lifelong learning needs of workers in a technical field such as engineering. Representing a merger of corporate and academic concerns, NTU broadcasts instruction nationwide via satellite. NTU was created in January 1984 to award accredited masters degrees in selected fields. The NTU academic programs feature approved courses of instruction offered by the 21 universities that have joined together to form  the Association for Media-based Continuing Education for Engineers (AMCEE). NTU also provides research seminars in each discipline taught; operates a modern telecommunications delivery system for convenient, flexible on-site service; offers AMCEE noncredit short courses, seminars, and workshops to introduce newly advanced technology concepts to a broad range of technical professionals; and has established a sophisticated satellite network infrastructure between industry and the university communities. NTU has participated in a study to address the accreditation and state licensing issues raised by a nationwide instructional network such as AMCEE and has undertaken an intensive 3-year test of using computer communications to enhance student-teacher interaction.

        "description":"From 1970 to 1980, Indiana's population grew 5.7 percent, with the white population growing less than 4 percent as opposed to a 30 percent growth rate for minority groups. Nearly 64.4 of the state's minority population resided in Marion and Lake counties as of 1980. Except for Asian Americans, Indiana residents who belong to ethnic minority groups tend to be much less well educated than their white counterparts. This is especially true of Hispanic persons. Minority group members have higher dropout and unemployment rates, and there are more illegitimate births and households headed by women among minority groups. These trends suggest that policymakers in Indiana will need to make a major commitment to see that all citizens, regardless of age or ethnic/racial background, have the  opportunity to develop and perform at the highest levels possible.

        "description":"A study gathered objective data to inform policymakers and the public about the role of the private career school in providing postsecondary vocational training. The universe of the study was made up of state-approved for-profit business, trade, and technical schools and nationally accredited cosmetology schools. A mailed questionnaire gathered data on the school practices, students, and economic impact on the states' economy. Five major findings emerged. Virginia's private career schools constituted a vocational training resource at least equal in size to the Virginia Community College System's occupational/technical programs. Private career schools were a diverse and highly competitive sector of higher education. They served a large number of disadvantaged students. Private  career schools were highly responsive to changes in the labor market and to the needs of local employers. They had a major impact on Virginia's economy. Four recommendations are made in the report: in future planning, policymakers should consider use of private career schools before expanding public programs; private career schools should be linked to state training efforts through innovative funding strategies; the department of education should develop a database of comparable data on private and public postsecondary training programs; and Virginia should initiate continuing programs of research and evaluation on both public and private postsecondary training.

        "description":"One hundred and eighty part-time instructors in 25 Alabama technical colleges responded to a questionnaire designed to obtain (1) demographic data on selected variables; (2) an assessment of the unique perceived competencies and professional development needs of this population; and (3) information to be used in the design of a program delivery system to meet the professional development needs of part-time instructors. The study found that the majority of the instructors worked at jobs other than teaching, taught two or three times a week, had work experience in 43 different occupational areas, and had taught at least three years. Only 27 of the instructors had attended college, while only 27 percent had participated in inservice professional development activities. Ninety-three  percent of the instructors think that part-time vocational instructors need help in developing teaching skills, and 89 percent indicated they would be interested in participating in teacher education activities. The study concluded that these part-time instructors want and would attend inservice professional development courses. On the basis of the study results, the development activities should be intense, short, highly concentrated, local, and practical. Part-time instructors should be compensated in some way for participating, and a professional development plan for each part-time instructor based on feedback from instructors, other faculty, and administrators should be developed and monitored.

        "description":"A definition of illiteracy is the inability to read and compute at the standard needed by an adult within a chosen social context. While statistics may vary depending upon the study, women make up the majority of the illiterates nationally and internationally. Three factors that contribute to illiteracy among women are social acculturation and sex-role stereotyping, personal problems that promote high school incompletion, and institutional barriers to women in adult basic education (ABE) programs. Programs geared to the needs of women entering ABE classes are beginning to surface. Nationally, other events and programs show promise in calling attention to the problems of illiteracy and the needs of illiterate women and men. The President's Adult Literacy Initiative has coordinated  and targeted existing funds to be used for a variety of initiatives. Some speak to needs of women, particularly the Headstart parents' project and 80 demonstration projects for dropouts and teens. Much of the real difference may be made by volunteers; the national initiatives assume that volunteers will carry the load. The Cuban model shows volunteerism is viable when government supports its efforts. The self-help collective--a model of empowerment--is another approach that has been adopted. (YLB)",

        "description":"Two reviews have been initiated regarding the extent of worker dislocation and efforts by the public and private sectors to assist dislocated workers. One assignment obtained information on the extent of business closures and permanent layoffs from a random sample of 2,600 such establishments via a telphone interview. Information on the assistance provided to dislocated workers was collected using a questionnaire mailed to establishments that closed or had a layoff. The other assignment gathered information on most Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Title III projects in operation from October 1982 through March 1985. Data were obtained from 563 projects. About 2.3 million workers were dislocated annually between 1979 and 1984. The manufacturing sector was most seriously  affected. The East North Central region had the most closures and layoffs and the second highest overall closure-layoff rate at 9.6 percent; the West South Central region had the highest rate of business closure and layoff at 12 percent. Businesses indicated the major reasons for closure or layoff were related to problems of competition in the marketplace. Most establishments that experienced a closure or permanent layoff provided some assistance to their dislocated workers. Two federal programs--Trade Adjustment Assistance and Title III of JTPA--provided assistance to at most 8 percent of the dislocated workers. (YLB)",

        "description":"The issue of how to react quickly to the educational needs arising from technological change has been deemed a central problem facing Technical and Further Education (TAFE) in Australia. Therefore, a national study examined various curriculum research methods that hold promise for speeding up the curriculum research and development process. The first phase of the study consisted of a description and analysis of group process methods. The following methods were analyzed: the Nominal Group Technique, the Developing a Curriculum Process (DACUM), the critical incident technique, Force Field Analysis, and brainstorming. It was concluded that the Search Conference, Delphi and exploratory methods, and, to a lesser extent, the Nominal Group Technique hold promise for providing data for  adapting curriculum to occupational structural change. DACUM, while a promising method of obtaining data in the cognitive domain, may need to be linked to other methods that are more sensitive to change when used as a curriculum research procedure on occupations undergoing structural change. The critical incident technique can be advantageous in curriculum research for short courses, and Force Field Analysis appears best suited for use as an adjunct to other group process methods. In addition to describing the research project and its findings, this report includes several chapters of practical guidelines on using and blending the various group process curriculum research methods. Appendixes include descriptions of some questionnaire methods used and a sample search conference,  observational studies, and a DACUM chart. Four pages of references and figures and tables are included. (MN)",

        "description":"The processes entailed in facilitating or leading workshops or seminars for researching the curriculum in Technical and Further Education (TAFE) were examined by using a modified Delphi process, which was followed by a 2-day workshop. Participants in the study were all experienced curriculum development specialists with knowledge of one or more of the following group process methods: Search Conference, Nominal Group Technique, Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) and its derivatives, and the Critical Incident Technique. The facilitator role was examined in terms of the value orientations (preferences) and social rules (guides for action) used by experienced TAFE facilitators/group leaders. The facilitator/group leadership process was shown to require complex interpersonal skills,  including the ability to set clear directions in a nonauthoritarian manner, negotiate flexibly with group members, face and resolve conflicts, and motivate groups. A model of the general stages and steps through which curriculum research workshops progress and a guide to the selection of group process methods for curriculum research in vocational education were developed on the basis of these research findings. Appendixes include instructions to the participants in the study workshop, a summary of the workshop examining the facilitator role, detailed results concerning facilitators' value orientations and social rules, and an example of personal constructs data.

The first section explains what individualized instruction is and examines the reasons for the recent increased interest in this instructional method. The next section, which addresses the important variables found in the research literature, suggests that while there are no advantages to self-pacing over group-pacing per se, the individualized approach (particularly Keller's Personalized System of Instruction) generally produces small but significant improvements in student achievement at the secondary level. This approach also  appears to produce favorable outcomes because of its use of small steps and requirement of mastery and provision of feedback at every step in the learning process. Evidence supporting the increased benefits of cooperation compared to competition (conventional instruction) or individualistic efforts (individualized instruction) is also provided. The next section compares individualized systems of instruction currently in use in New South Wales, Victoria, and South and Western Australia. The final section discusses the main conclusions drawn from the study with repsect to development and implementation of individualized programs including various innovations that have been or are being introduced in TAFE; instructional features and educational outcomes; important student, course, and  individualized instruction variables in implemented programs; and curriculum development. Three pages of references are provided. (MN)",

        "description":"Because none of the traditional programs that have been introduced to provide trade and skills training in remote Aboriginal communities has produced qualified tradespersons, a project was undertaken to develop and pilot test an apprenticeship training system called the Modular Integrated Training System (MITS). Visits to remote Aboriginal communities indicated that Aborignal people generally shy away from traditional apprenticeship programs because of their reluctance to form close relationships with Europeans, difficulty in coming to terms with the Western work ethic, and difficulties in relating to technical instruction. Existing apprenticeship training programs were then examined to find ways of overcoming these difficulties. Pursuant to this examination, the MITS was  designed to allow trainees to determine the rate at which their training progressed, obtain training in their own remote communities doing the work that is normally carried on in local workshops, and acquire any of several levels of training rather than being forced to choose between the all or nothing alternatives of traditional apprenticeship programs. MITS also works to demystify the trades by focusing on the knowledge and skills required for effective job performance. (Appendixes include the interview schedules for visits to Aboriginal communities and training institutions, notes on preparation of the pilot module and a sample of the modular materials, results of the pilot test, resources recommended for use in preparing modular training system programs, and criteria for the Rural  Communities and Associations Northern Territory Award.)

In 19 SDAs the same organization was the grant recipient and administrative entity. A number of arrangements existed between the Private Industry Councils (PICs) and the SDAs. The most common pattern was for the PIC to play an advisory role. In most cases local elected officials relied on professional employment and training office staff to serve their interests and did not take a visible role in policy decision making for the SDA. In about half of the SDAs, financial liability and eligibility verification did not appear to be significant issues of discussion. Enrolling youths was a major implementation problem for many SDAs. Overall, SDAs had shifted from  developmental strategies pursued under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act to an emphasis on creating private-sector training slots. Half of the SDAs indicated they expected to make changes in their mix of Title IIA programs, the most frequent change being use of on-the-job training. Only seven SDAs had Title III projects; another nine had Title III projects operating within their geographic boundaries. (YLB)",

Demographic characteristics of the 25,531 students who were enrolled in ABE during the year under examination were similar to those of students in previous years. The student population continued to be young, single, and nearly evenly divided with respect to sex. The most frequent reason for program participation cited was to obtain a diploma, and friends and relatives were students' most frequent source of information about ABE program offerings. Although there was a 1.0  percent decrease from 1984-85, the student-to-staff ratio remained 12 to 1 in 1985-86. In paid positions, female staff barely outnumbered male staff; however, females comprised over three-fourths of ABE volunteers. Significant efforts to cooperate with other agencies, increase student enrollments, and offer programming to meet the needs of various special target groups were also evident for the year under study. (Appendixes include the survey instruments used to gather data, the statistical section of the 1985-86 Federal Adult Education Annual Performance and Evaluation Report, a 1985-86 county-by-county summary of ABE programs in Pennsylvania, and a report on 1985-86 Section 310-funded projects.

        "description":"As more states increase the number of credits required for high school graduation, progressively less time is being left for vocational education. To address this problem, many school districts and states are beginning to formulate policies for granting academic credit for basic skills training provided in vocational classrooms. As of 1985, 11 states had a policy of allowing vocational credit to be counted in lieu of science or mathematics, and 16 states gave local school districts jurisdiction over course credit approval. Only three states had policies prohibiting credit allowance for occupational/technical subjects as a substitute for math, science, or other required subjects. Under the New York State Regents Action Plan, state-developed vocational syllabi may be used for  credit courses in occupationally related math and science. Virginia's 20-credit hour diploma provides an option whereby completion of a 300-hour instructional sequence in most vocational specialties counts as fulfillment of the state's requirement that high school graduates complete two years of science and two of math. The Great Oaks Joint Vocational District in Cincinnati, Ohio, offers five vocational programs in which vocational and academic subject matter specialists coordinate basic skills and vocational instruction in 3-hour instructional blocks. The 2 + 2 Tech-Prep Associate Degree Program provides for a closely coordinated course of technical study during the last two years of high school and first two years of college. (MN)",

        "description":"Correctional education is a generic term describing a wide range of educational activities that take place in institutional and community settings. In 1986, 37 states and the District of Columbia provided correctional education to incarcerated adults directly through state departments of corrections. In addition, several states have created alternative administrative structures to address problems associated with traditional delivery of correctional education such as lack of funding, community resources, coordination with and support from other state agencies, adequately trained staff, and coordination with other educational institutions. During the past 15 years, extensive litigation in the U.S. correctional system has affected correctional education. This is particularly true  in the areas of inmates' rights to education and parity for female offenders. Although the prevalence of handicaps among incarcerated juvenile offenders has been studied extensively, little research has been done in the area of the extent of learning disabilities among adult offenders. Although it is a new area, a program combining special educational with appropriate transitional and aftercare services in the context of complex multiagency planning and service delivery gives evidence of substantially reducing habitual patterns of criminal behavior. Because it teaches skills that inmates can use to gain employment after release, vocational education is also important in reducing recidivism. Another new and promising area of service delivery is that of postsecondary correctional education.  (MN)",

        "author":["Kerka, Sandra"],
        "description":"Changing socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic forces have caused educational nonparticipation among adults to be treated as a social issue. Recent research has attempted to combine dispositional, situational, and environmental factors into composite models of participation. These models have suggested the following categories of deterrence factors: individual, family, or home-related problems; cost concerns; questionable available educational opportunities, negative perceptions of the value of education in general, lack of motivation and/or self-confidence, a general tendency toward nonaffiliation, and incompatibilities of time and/or place. These deterrents can be addressed by providing educational opportunities with low levels of risk or threat, administrative accommodation  (such as alternative scheduling or extended hours for counseling), and effective communication of timely and appropriate information about educational opportunities targeted to the needs and concerns of various special needs audiences. Traditional marketing concepts can also be used to reach hard-to-reach learners. These include (1) a market analysis assessing market segmentation, clientele, and competition and (2) a program orchestration effort establishing an appropriate marketing mix of price, product, place, promotion, and partners. (This digest includes specific strategies for addressing the special needs of reentry women, elderly individuals, educationally disadvantaged persons, and rural adults.) (MN)",

Aquaculture is a new component, added because of increased recognition of the opportunities offered by Connecticut's rich shoreline resources. A brochure and flyer on the aquaculture program follow a promotion packet containing the basic materials needed to &quot;pitch&quot; the program to the news media. Sample letters and media presentations are included. The curriculum for both components consists of these units: 3 exploratory and 18 specialized natural resources units and 16 exploratory and 13 specialized aquaculture units. Exploratory units are generally appropriate for grades 9 and 10; specialized units are designed for grades 11 and 12.  Each unit has these components: unit title, length (time), when taught (grade and semester), student objectives, related job titles and relevant competencies, content outline, teacher and student activities, evaluation recommendations, a listing of resources, bibliography, and media list. Representative natural resources topics include conservation; forestry; wildlife management; outdoor safety; Christmas tree production; fish culture; forest fires; forest harvesting, measurement, products, protection, soils, surveying and land measurement; game bird propagation; recreation; and timber management. Representative aquaculture topics are boat handling, first aid, pipe fitting, rope splicing, knot tying, cranberry culture, fish culture, metals and welding, tides and currents, aquaculture  business management, boat repair and maintenance, boat building, saltwater fishing, and lobstering.

        "description":"The supply and demand were projected for university teaching positions in departments listed in the \"Industrial Teacher Education Directory\" based upon age distribution, retirement projections, and number of doctoral graduates. Data were collected through a mail survey to department heads/chairs. The specific age distribution of industrial education faculty indicated the profession is growing older with one-fifth of the faculty 55 years old or older. Early retirement options had already had an impact on faculty over 55. Not quite two-thirds of the respondents indicated that their institutions had an early retirement option. Department heads estimated 268 new positions and a loss of 92 positions. Findings suggested it had been relatively difficult for department heads to hire  replacement faculty. Of those indicating an area, 44.8 percent indicated that electronics-related specialties were the most difficult to fill. There were 357 doctoral students pursuing a program in an area related to industrial education. Data indicated that there will be supply/demand problems in attempting to fill university faculty positions in industrial education with individuals who hold the doctorate. Approximately 1.2 vacancies per doctoral student in the next five years were projected. (YLB)",

        "description":"This study determined the impact of vocational agriculture training on the continued learning patterns of former Montana vocational agriculture students who graduated from high school between 1980 and 1985. Data for the study were gathered through the use of mailed questionnaires sent to a sample of 500 former students, with a return of 281 usable questionnaires. Information from the returned questionnaires was coded, entered on a data disk using &quot;WordStar&quot; and statistically analyzed with the use of &quot;MSU STAT&quot; (Montana State University Statistical Package). Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that vocational agriculture training did have an impact on the continued learning patterns of former Montana students. Students felt that vocational agriculture experiences  influenced their decision about postsecondary education greatly or to some extent. Most students did attend a postsecondary educational institution after high school graduation, and felt that vocational agriculture influenced their selection of a major. They also indicated that vocational agriculture greatly or to some extent prepared them for college. Students who attended a postsecondary educational institution after high school graduation more frequently participated in other knowledge-gaining activities than did students who did not attend a postsecondary educational institution.

        "description":"The practice of interviewing individuals rather than groups has been based largely upon methodological concerns for preventing contamination of data. The assumptions that (1) the data provided by individuals can, in aggregate, yield social truth; (2) individuals are conscious of social phenomena; and (3) the whole of social reality is equal to the sum of its parts all bear critical examination. The prevailing assumptions about the source of social knowledge, the nature of knowledge itself, and appropriate research methods have been shaped by the philosophy of individualism. Groups are frequently the only appropriate source of social knowledge. Because the results of group interviews are interactive, they will produce meanings that are social products and that probably will be  quite different from the prior, socially untested perceptions of any single individual. Group interviews allow the researcher to observe the ways in which interview participants stimulate each other and provide clues to the language, terms, and codes that participants share. Case studies of a program evaluation, a peer group self-analysis, and an assessment of women's perceptions of barriers in job training programs for nontraditional occupations illustrate the role of the group interview in participatory research groups and Freirean study circles where the group factor is significant in and of itself.

        "author":["Rounds, James B., Jr."],
        "description":"Two studies, one cross-sectional and the other longitudinal, examined individual differences in subjective perceptions of disabilities. In study 1, 37 (22 unsuccessful and 15 successful) applicants to and 29 (12 first year and 17 second year) graduate students in a rehabilitation counseling master's degree program judged the similarity of all possible pairs of 12 disabilities. The similarity judgments were scaled with a three-way multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, yielding a three-dimensional solution. Regressing each of 14 attribute ratings onto the MDS stimulus coordinates suggested that the dimensions of normality, severity, and responsibility were significant components of the disability perceptions. Comparison of the students' disability perceptions with dimensions  identified from a reanalysis of Tringo's (1970) social distance data provided evidence for the external validity of the normality and severity dimensions. The unsuccessful applicants gave significantly more weight to the normality dimension than did the second year students in judging the similarities among disabilities. In study 2, 14 rehabilitation counseling students completed the questionnaire developed in study 1 at three time points: application, end of first year, and end of the second year of a 2-year master's program. The normality, severity, and responsibility dimensions found using a cross-sectional methodology emerged in the longitudinal MDS analysis. The structure of disability perceptions remained stable across the 2 years of the program. The normality and sensory dimensions  became less important and the responsibility dimension more salient as training progressed. The application of MDS to disability perceptions and the relationship of disability perceptions to attitudes toward disabilities and rehabilitation training are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper addresses the issue of homosexuals who want to change their sexual orientation. It is noted that many ego-dystonic homosexuals who want to become heterosexual, despite encouragement from psychotherapists to accept their homosexuality, are turning to self-help groups in an effort to change their sexual orientation. Studies that have attempted to change sexual orientation are reviewed in this paper. Problems with defining and measuring change in sexual orientation are considered and the importance of therapies for changing sexual orientation is discussed. Studies involving psychoanalytic therapies are reviewed. Several studies on behavior therapies are examined, including studies of aversion therapy, classical conditioning, and systematic desensitization. Studies dealing  with group therapy are discussed under the headings of heterogeneous groups, homogeneous groups, and self-help groups. Problems associated with each type of therapy are noted. The paper concludes that studies in which changes in sexual orientation seem most complete involve a change in lifestyle whereby the person takes on a new social and sexual identity. It is asserted that psychotherapists can offer better help to homosexuals desiring to change their sexual orientation as aspects of sexual identity and lifestyle are more fully addressed.

Effective schools research may yield useful knowledge in educating at-risk youth or research could warn that the effective schools movement could threaten the education of at-risk youth if not accompanied by support for potential dropouts. Characteristics of effective schools include effective school leadership, the belief that carefully planned instruction will work and students will learn, close monitoring of student progress, and a clearly described and family implemented discipline code. Although students come to school with various socioeconomic factors associated with being at risk, the school's environment still affects  the students. Successful schools have a positive impact on all students' achievement; less successful schools promote lower expectations and provide little support. Successful dropout prevention programs often separate dropouts from other students, relate work and education, and have low student-teacher ratios with counseling support. Many features of effective schools are consistent with successful programs for at-risk youth such as staff commitment, strong leadership, and fair discipline. Unlike effective schools, successful at-risk youth programs are small with a narrow curriculum focus. The knowledge of alternative programs for at-risk youth seems to support findings and recommendations of effective school researchers, with differences primarily concerning curriculum goals or purposes  of education.

Chapter 1, &quot;Recent Developments in the Treatment of Adolescent Sex Offenders&quot; (Fay Honey Knopp), discusses the status of treatment facilities for adolescent sexual offenders in the United States and advocates restorative rather than punitive approaches to adolescent sexual offenders. Chapter 2, &quot;Methodological and Ethical Issues in Evaluating and Treating Adolescent Sexual Offenders&quot; (Judith V. Becker and  Gene G. Abel), reports the results of studies on adolescent sexual offenders and discusses problems and ethical issues in doing research on offenders. Chapter 3, &quot;The Adolescent Sexual Offender: Background and Research Perspectives&quot; (Robert E. Freeman-Longo), presents the perspective of one working in a closed treatment facility. Chapter 4, &quot;Adolescent Sexual Offenders: An Outpatient Program's Perspective on Research Directions&quot; (Michael O'Brien), describes an outpatient treatment program and offers a useful classification of various types of adolescent offenders. Chapter 5, &quot;Juvenile Sexual Offenders: A Family Systems Paradigm&quot; (Caren Monastersky and Wayne Smith), reviews some accepted principles in the field, describes one approach to working with adolescent offenders, and provides a  sexual offense continuum useful in designing therapy.

The term Attention Deficit Disorder is explained. A case study of a hyperactive child is presented, assessment of hyperactivity is discussed, causes of hyperactivity are considered, treatment is reviewed, and the prognosis for hyperactive children is described. The section on childhood depression presents a case study of a depressed child and addresses the issues of assessment, causes of childhood depression, and intervention  strategies.

        "description":"How people perceive disabilities plays an important role in the lives of individuals with disabilities, in rehabilitation theories, and in the professional training and practice of rehabilitation counselors. Individual differences in subjective perceptions of disabilities were investigated. Thirty-seven applicants (22 unsuccessful and 15 successful) to a rehabilitation counseling master's degree program and 29 graduate students (12 first year and 17 second year) in this program judged the similarity of all possible pairs of 12 disabilities. In addition, each of the 12 disabilities was rated on 15 attribute scales. The similarity judgments were scaled with a three-way multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, yielding a three-dimensional solution. Regressing attribute ratings onto  the MDS stimulus coordinates suggested that the dimensions of normality, severity, and controllability were significant components of the disability perceptions. In comparison to the second year students, the unsuccessful applicants gave significantly more weight to the normality dimension in judging the similarities among disabilities. A comparison of these results with prior research and the applicability of the MDS dimensions to the design of interventions for changing attitudes toward disabilities are discussed. (Author/NB)",

A questionnaire was designed to assess beliefs and attitudes related to women's roles in work and family life. It was translated into Japanese for purposes of comparison. Questionnaires were administered to over 200 Japanese and American housewives. T-tests were used to test for significance of differences between groups. The results showed that Japanese and American housewives had only a slight tendency to believe that they could be happy as full-time housewives. Both groups agreed that a mother should not be employed when there is an infant or pre-school child in the family. In comparison with American housewives, Japanese housewives tended  to believe more strongly that a wife/mother's employment would have harmful effects on marriage and child development; that married women should be home rearing children instead of working outside the home; and that a wife/mother should not be employed when there is a school-aged or teenage child in the family, or when a husband wants her home. American houewives tended to believe more strongly that women are capable of handling both homemaking and career responsibilities. Findings are discussed in terms of comparative cultural traditions and change. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper begins by discussing a National Institute of Education report (NIE, 1984) which was compiled by the study group on the conditions of excellence in American higher education and which focused on student involvement, higher expectations, and assessment and feedback. The NIE report is presented as a framework which academic professionals can use to evaluate and develop programs to enhance the quality of undergraduate education. The roles of student affairs professionals in contributing to quality education are highlighted and principles of student involvement and assessment and how they are being implemented into practice through student development programs are discussed. A new theory of Student Involvement (Astin, 1985) is presented and three theories of student  learning (content, resource, and individualized) are examined. A possible assessment approach which could be used by professionals to evaluate the contributions made by student affairs programs and by the quality of student involvement to the overall education of undergraduates is presented. A section on implementation of the principles identifies six developmental needs of students and reviews the ways that various student affairs programs attempt to meet those needs. A final section addresses the issue of value addedness, the positive difference that an educational experience makes in a student's knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The value added program at Northeast Missouri State University is described. Thirty-four references are provided (NB)",

        "description":"The Computer-Assisted Study Skills Improvement Program (CASSIP) uses interactive instruction with a computer in these areas: managing time, improving memory, taking lecture notes, reading textbooks, taking examinations, writing themes and reports, making oral reports, improving scholastic motivation, improving interpersonal relations, and improving concentration. This study surveyed by questionnaire the reactions of CASSIP directors (n=27) regarding the effectiveness of CASSIP, publicizing procedures, and hardware/software problems. Reported advantages of CASSIP were: (1) counselees could proceed at their own pace, take better notes from the computer, and review as needed; (2) the computer was not judgmental and did not forget material or digress from the subject; and (3) the  computer presented material in smaller units, provided counselees with instantaneous feedback, worked unlimited hours, and could store large amounts of information. Disadvantages of CASSIP were also reported. One disadvantage was that the counselees might accept information without questioning its validity and might act on the computer's suggestions without seeking help in their evaluation. Another disadvantage was that the computer lacked human feelings such as empathy, was insensitive to counselee needs, and had limited capacity for individualized responses to counselees; it was also reported that the computer could permit too easy access to confidential files, required programming skills not usually possessed by counselors, and start-up costs could exceed resources. It appears that  CASSIP's advantages, however, outweigh its disadvantages. (ABL)",

Additionally, Chapter 1 authorizes smaller programs which provide services for students from migrant families, students in state facilities for the handicapped, and students in state-operated or supported institutions for the neglected or delinquent (N or D). This report, funded by the United States Department of Education and intended for federal policymakers, presents an analysis of state Chapter 1 programs for N or D students. The following topics are discussed in separate sections of the report: (1) federal and state administrative operations including responsibilities of state educational agencies; (2)  facility operations including specifics of three state programs as well as a general overview; and (3) transitional programs including alternative high schools and group homes. A final section discusses findings and conclusions in the areas of quality of program information, compliance, program identity, and transitional programs. The report concludes that although the N and D program needs fine tuning, the program is generally well-executed and students enrolled in Chapter 1 classes show improvement.

The students, who were primarily freshman and sophomores, completed the Sex Education Questionnaire and the Knowledge of Sexuality Test, among other measures. Individual reading and peers were the highest rated sources of information. Institutions were highly rated sources for topics related to the anatomy and physiology of  sex and venereal disease. While CE students received more information overall than did CIE individuals, the two groups did not differ in the amount of information received from parents.

The members of each couple had worked at least 5 years prior to the birth of their first child after the mother was age 30. Responses by both husbands and wives to a questionnaire revealed that finances, careers, and the biological timeclock were the most frequent reasons for delaying childbirth. Respondents reported reading childrearing books, experiencing little outside pressure to have children, and not caring what the sex of the baby would be prior to the birth. Almost one-half of the women took some time off from work, with their employers quite supportive during and after the pregnancy. When asked to advise  other delayed childbearing couples, most pointed out that maturity was important and that one had to be prepared to alter one's lifestyle. The 1984 demographic trends from Statistics Canada are presented, existing literature is reviewed, and 18 impressions subjectively gathered during interviews are enumerated.

Female clerical workers (N=44) who were married and/or had a child living at home completed questionnaires rating two dimensions of their work and family roles: (1) quality of interpersonal relations and role satisfaction; and (2) levels of depression and anxiety. Associations satisfaction - and levels of depression and anxiety. Associations between mental health and role conditions were evaluated for work and family roles separately. Two models of how experiences in the two roles are jointly linked to mental health were tested.  According to an additive model, work and family roles act independently, whereas an interactive model suggests that conditions in one role modify the effect of the other role. As predicted, greater psychological distress was found among women who described their social interaction at home and at work as conflictual and nonsupportive, and who reported being dissatisfied with their work and family roles. An additive model seemed to best describe how the two roles conjointly related to well being: stress in one role appeared to have a constant impact on mental health, regardless of interpersonal relations or satisfaction in the other role. There was no evidence for the interactive model; conditions in one role did not modify the psychological effects of the other role. (Author/NB)",

It points out that more and more organizations are sponsoring health programs that promote the concept of self-care and self-help practices, and that many of these programs have been tailored to the special needs of the elderly. The document provides a directory of information about a broad variety of national organizations that deal specifically with the elderly, or that have programs relevant to older people, their families, and health professionals who work with them. The organization name, address, telephone number, membership information, and a general  and health-related description are given for each of the directory's 90 entries. Information on the organizations' periodicals, publications, and other media is given for organizations involved in these activities. Listings include organizations concerned with specific health problems such as Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, diabetes, or heart disease; religious organizations; and organizations concerned with various aspects of aging.

This document provides policy recommendations formed by a consensus conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and attended by biomedical investigators, blood bank specialists, clinicians, consumers, and representatives of public interest groups. The recommendations concern these areas: (1) tests that are currently being used to screen for AIDS and test performance characteristics; (2) what constitutes a positive test, how a positive HIV-antibody test should be interpreted, and how these tests should be used; (3) how to handle positive test  results; (4) the psychosocial ramifications for blood donors of knowledge of a positive test result; (5) the impact testing has had on transfusion medicine; and (6) what research directions should be pursued. The conclusions in this report call for more sensitive tests to identify infectivity, better methods of discouraging possibly infected donors, and better methods of handling psychological problems occurring in those with positive tests.

        "description":"Police officers help children grow up in a law-abiding society. In nurturing and protecting the young, there must be a division of labor among responsible adults; it is difficult for police officers to do their job if others do not help. In the 1960's and 1970's, the attitude existed that schools should do the schooling without interference from families, neighborhoods, and churches. Americans learned that this did not work. A similar lesson is being learned about children and drugs. The drug problem is the greatest single threat to the well-being of our children; solving this problem will require appropriate division of labor. The incorrect attitude has been that the drug problem is solely a law enforcement problem and police officers should solve it. Whether or not a child gets  involved with drugs depends on moral guidance taught at home and in school. Parents at home, teachers in schools, and friends in neighborhoods share the responsibility of enforcing drug laws. Although police officers have taken up extra responsibility by educating about drugs, others such as schools have not always carried out their responsibilities. A handbook, \"Schools without Drugs,\" meant to help get drugs out of our schools, homes, and communities has been made available by the Department of Education. Parents, educators, and others can be valuable police allies in drug enforcement. (ABL)",

The introduction states that the term therapeutic tactics was chosen to describe a class of interventions which are closer in nature to strategic ploys used in a contest rather than collaborative techniques traditionally employed by psychotherapists. A program description includes discussions of referral sources, treatment modalities, treatment goals, and a description of clients. The therapeutic tactics used (which are also known as paradoxical, strategic, or therapeutic double binds) are described in detail in these sections: (1) opening game; (2) establishing the parameters of treatment; (3) redirecting the client's energy; (4)  protecting the client's self-esteem; (5) middle game; (6) fostering closeness and intimacy; (7) minimizing the demoralizing aspects of recurring conflict; (8) introducing new skills and behaviors; (9) minimizing the fear of failure; and (10) end game. It is stated in conclusion that these tactics are only one aspect of a treatment program that employs a variety of more traditional techniques and that these tactics enhance the effects of other interventions.

        "description":"Goal-setting literature has suggested that specific, difficult goals will produce higher performance levels than easy goals. A difficult task or one with negative performance feedback may increase an individual's perceived challenge of the task which may in turn enhance his motivation. Effects of the Protestant work ethic and perceived challenge on subjects' time allocated to an experimental task were examined in two experiments. In Experiment 1, using 49 volunteers, employees of a manufacturing company located in Cleveland, Ohio, the perceived challenge was manipulated by labeling an identical task (anagram solution) as either difficult or easy. Participants completed personality measures including the measurement of their endorsement of the Protestant work ethic. Most time on  task occurred for the subjects who scored a low work ethic and when the task was labeled as difficult. For subjects who endorsed the work ethic, their free-choice time was not affected by the task label. In Experiment 2, using 57 Taiwan college students, the perceived challenge was manipulated by providing negative versus positive effort performance feedback. Low work ethic subjects in the negative feedback condition again spent the highest amount of their free-choice time on the task. High work ethic subjects' behavior in the free-choice period was not affected by the performance feedback. Further, people with medium work ethic endorsement allocated more free-choice time to the task in the positive feedback condition than they did in the negative feedback condition. Results suggested  that low work ethic individuals exerted more effort in the free-choice period when they were challenged. (ABL)",

        "author":["Broden, Margareta Berg"],
        "description":"A theory of normal mother-infant relationship based on Margaret Mahler's theories is the basis of a treatment program for disturbed mother/infant relationships. This theory includes the concept of symbiosis which for the child is an undifferentiated condition, a fusion with the mother where the two have a common outward border, thereby protecting the immature ego of the child against too early stress. Signs of disturbed symbiosis in the child include tenseness, jerky movements, low muscular tone, avoidance of body contact, brief or avoided eye contact, quietness, late babbling, and excessive screaming. There is a lack of synchrony in interaction between mother and child. After the symbiosis stage comes the differentiation phase which is the beginning of independence. Signs of  disturbed differentiation include anxiety and the lack of desire for new discoveries on the part of the child. This treatment model aims to help the the mother and child establish a symbiotic relationship and initiate the psychological separation process. Treatment supports these processes by removing obstacles and enhancing the natural mother-child contact channels. It is vital for successful treatment to identify bonding failures early before the end of the first year. Although the therapeutic unit is the mother/child dyad, groups of mothers and children meet regularly. Five levels of therapeutic intevention are used, including direct intervention with the mother and child, work with the mother, work with the baby, family therapy, and social work. Preliminary results indicate successful  achievement of goals in the majority of cases. (ABL)",

Through a historical review, the paper reveals that using the interpersonal voice and the author's commentary are legitimate rhetorical devices. Interviews with prominent contemporary rhetoricians disclose various ideas for improving textbooks with metadiscourse. The paper then discusses a descriptive study of metadiscourse in social studies textbooks and other books that found that books that are not textbooks use more metadiscourse and appear more lively than textbooks. A case study evaluation of a chapter in a typical sixth grade social studies textbook is described and several problems related to metadiscourse discovered  in the case study are revealed. An experimental study of the effects of metadiscourse and interpersonal voice on retention and attitude is presented. Finally, the paper discusses the results that indicated metadiscourse was helpful for certain subgroups of students, depending on whether the interpersonal voice was used or not.

Data were gathered from 159 fifth and sixth grade students and their teachers. Results indicated that a writing environment emphasizing peer editing and publication and/or instruction in text structure significantly increased students' ability to compose expository text. Findings also showed that writing environment and text structure instruction significantly increased students' ability to summarize information across two expository passages. Data indicated that students in the text structure  instruction groups made significant gains in free writing, surpassing the control students on all measures of writing ability. Similar results were obtained both when teachers directed instruction in text structure and when students directed the learning through peer editing and conferences.

Eight students in grades five through eight participated in a workshop that met 3 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 4 weeks. The students began with the easier games that involve little text reading and gradually moved on to the most sophisticated text-oriented interactive fiction. An observer helped the students to overcome problems in solving the quest so that the students would keep reading. All students were deeply engrossed in these programs, and the only condition that diminished student interest or motivation was an inability, after repeated  attempts, to move ahead or solve a dilemma in the quest. None of the students reacted negatively to the considerable amount of reading required of most of the programs. Results suggest (1) students with no more than average interest in reading will spend large amounts of time engaged in interactive fiction that requires heavy amounts of reading if they are successful at carrying forward with the quest and (2) interactive fiction could be used to encourage students to read independently.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between children's out-of-school activities and their reading achievement. Subjects, 155 fifth graders from a village school and a small city school in Illinois, recorded on daily activity forms how many minutes they spent on a wide range of out-of-school activities. Forms were completed for periods ranging from 8 to 26 weeks. Results showed that of all the ways children spent their time, reading books was the best predictor of several measures of reading achievement, including gains in reading achievement between second and fifth grade. Results also showed, however, that on most days, most children did little or no book reading. Findings suggest that teachers and parents need to give a higher priority to promoting book reading. References,  tables and figures are appended. (HTH)",

        "description":"Effective teaching strategies must be developed to help students bridge the gap between concrete operational thinking and full formal thinking in the content areas. Reading for meaning requires readers to categorize subjects, recognize relationships, develop and maintain a sequence of thought, recognize and understand inferences, and draw conclusions. Teachers must teach students to (1) recognize the impact of certain key words that provide cues for forming hypotheses; (2) make inferential deductions by showing them explicitly how an argument is developed by an author; (3) ask questions and consider possible answers to them; (4) compare and contrast, a productive linking exercise that develops decision-making abilities; (5) organize information by examining structure apart from  content, such as in hierarchy development; (6) see more than one side of an issue and generate all of the possible interrelationships between the components of particular situations; and (7) be critical thinkers, alert to the subtleties in the material they read. In addition, teachers can use charts and graphs to encourage students to raise questions, spark group discussions, draw attention to the concept of variable as opposed to static situations, heighten the level of classroom motivation to examine material carefully, and demonstrate the interrelationships between several disciplines.

Subjects, 126 college freshmen, randomly assigned to one of three groups, received instruction and practice in the discourse structure summarization procedure (experimental condition), answered and discussed questions (conventional condition), or neither (control condition) after reading history texts. Analysis of results indicated that the summarization procedure reliably improved the recall of unfamiliar history text for students in the experimental condition when compared to the recall of students in the  conventional or control conditions. Results further indicated that the writing of students in the experimental condition received reliably better ratings than did that of control students, though there was no reliable difference between the writing of students in the experimental and conventional conditions.

        "description":"Focusing on common misconceptions about children who have trouble learning to read, two papers discuss new ways to think about and teach these students. &quot;Revaluing Readers and Reading,&quot; by Kenneth S. Goodman, argues that troubled readers should not be thought of as sufferers from an illness, but as strong, healthy individuals fully capable of learning how to read. To help prepare educators to build on these strengths, Goodman discusses some basic facts about how reading, as a unitary psycholinguistic process, works and develops. Geoffrey Williams and David Jacks' paper, &quot;The Role of Story: Learning to Read in a Special Education Class,&quot; explores (1) the assumption that children who have trouble learning to read are deficient; (2) whether a change in approach that emphasizes the  social uses of written language might, over an extended period of time, enable them to read more confidently; and (3) the practical management of collaborative language research in a special education setting. To accomplish these purposes, the article details the progress made in 1 year by 13 elementary children in a special education class. The class emphasized extending the functional range of written stories by employing what children already knew about the oral use of narrative. (JD)",

        "description":"The theme for the celebration of the Library of Congress treasures, &quot;The World Encompassed,&quot; is suggested by the title of a nephew's account of Sir Francis Drake's circumnavigation of the earth. This account is part of the Sir Francis Drake collection donated by patrons to the library. In April 1581, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for what was then the most profitable enterprise in the history of seafaring. Drake's career can remind those accustomed to television images that show reality as though it has sharp edges of some easily forgotton ambiguities and fuzzy edges of the great history-making adventures--whether they are the circumnavigations of the earth or the circumnavigations of the mind. Of all the nation's institutions, none tries more strenuously, more grandly,  or more effectively to encompass the world than the Library of Congress. The library's treasures bear witness to that endeavor. Drake's voyage reminds us that only rarely is some great world-encompassing project accomplished in a predicted time. Great enterprises are enterprises of high risk, and high risk means great uncertainty. The Library of Congress, or any great library, is a point of embarkation on voyages for which there can be no timetable. Commitment to any of the greatest enterprises--circumnavigation of the earth or of the English language or of the world of science--is heroic because it is a commitment to the unknown. (HTH)",

The study also examined difficulties that students encountered in regulating the role of editing while composing a first draft, resisting the temptation to edit frequently while using the word processor, planning during either the composing or revision sessions, and making global revisions to first draft compositions. Subjects, eight average and eight talented eighth grade students, completed four tasks, each of which  constrained the composing conditions in some way. Tasks included a \"no edit\" composing session, \"free edit\" composing session, directed revision task, and spontaneous revision session. Findings indicated that the talented students, without the concomitant distraction of editing while composing on the computer, created valuable content in their preliminary drafts and then significantly improved their texts through global revisions. However, results suggested that the provision of word processors benefited neither the writing processes nor products of the average students. (Methods of protocol analysis are appended.) (JD)",

Formal text-based and personal reader-based writing samples produced by 65 tenth grade students in response to two stories from D. Sohn's &quot;Ten Modern American Short Stories&quot; were analyzed for quality of response, audience, function, syntactic complexity, fluency, and types of response statements. Findings indicated that the reader-based or personal writing tasks enabled the students to produce qualitatively more effective responses that tended to be more fluent and constructed with a wider range of response statements than were the formal responses. Thus, in spite of their limited experience in analytic writing, the students were capable of a variety of  approaches to literature. A shift in audience from teacher-as-examiner to teacher-student dialogue in the personal writing indicated a tentativeness that permitted the students to invite their reader into their explorations of the short stories. Though the two approaches were not mutually exclusive, students took different experiences from them. The results suggest that writing can be used as an effective tool for understanding literary texts.

        "description":"Peer tutoring has a long historical precedent in western civilization. Since its reemergence in the United States during the 1960s, it has been used for every age group, subject matter, and level of intelligence. Numerous research studies have shown the benefits of peer tutoring, its efficacy in the college writing center has caught the attention of leaders in the field of English education, and it is most eloquently supported in K. Bruffee's \"Peer Tutoring and the 'Conversation of Mankind.'\" Peer tutors are effective in helping students with the different stages of the writing process, but that effectiveness depends primarily on the type of training tutors receive. The most emulated college program was formulated by Bruffee at Brooklyn College, and emphasizes peer criticism.  Like any other technique that promises fast action and quick results, peer tutoring should be scrutinized seriously. Tutors could be rated by observers using a performance checklist, or, for a more summative evaluation, a pretest and posttest could be given to the student to determine improvements as a result of the tutoring.

        "description":"The kind of literacy education currently valued in America has been ineffective in teaching more thoughtful literacy skills. A sociocognitive approach to literacy instruction focuses on developing the thinking skills that students will use as they engage in socially purposeful activities. Teachers, tests, and instructional materials in this approach emphasize not isolated bits of knowledge, but students' growing ability to use language and communication skills in more varied and reasoned ways. This approach to literacy instruction also maintains that (1) skills, structure, and routines are internalized en route to accomplishing purposeful and socially meaningful activities, and (2) the kinds of literate thinking that learners acquire is reflective of the social context in which  literacy is learned. If schools are to teach higher levels of literate thinking, teachers must value and use these activities as part of the ongoing social-communicative fabric of the classroom. When this occurs, the nature of instructional activities will shift from practice to application. In addition, literacy education will change its focus from reading and writing to ways of thinking appropriate to the demands of present society. (Included are examples of instruction from a sociocognitive perspective, such as logs, letter writing, uses of language, writing a newspaper, and a prereading plan.) (JD)",

        "description":"A study investigated how a teaching approach that emphasized literature would affect children's writings and help them to apply elements of form and content. Six first grade classes in a rural Newfoundland school district participated in the study; the students performed similarly on overall readiness. The class randomly selected as the experimental group (the &quot;literature group&quot;) was judged to be representative of the whole group; the other five classes, using basal readers, formed the control group. Hypotheses predicted that the literature group would (1) produce writings superior to those of the basal reading classes, and (2) develop a sensitivity to good form and content. Subjects, 18 first graders, wrote and read selections of poetry, fairy tales and fantasy in a  pretest/posttest scenario. Findings were categorized under six major headings: form, content, vocabulary, sentence structure, writer reaction and originality. Findings suggest that the literature approach helped to broaden children's experiences beyond their own egocentric world, influencing the length, fluency, and literary quality of their writing. The class demonstrated a high standard of writing and performance in both its language development and use of literary techniques. In contrast, the basal class's writings revealed simple sentences, relatively undeveloped stylistic features, and a lack of vocabulary depth. Findings suggested that literature be used extensively with all children on a regular basis to further their language development, flow of ideas, and production of alternate  writing forms.

        "description":"Focusing on humor as a powerful instructional resource, this booklet addresses a variety of issues regarding humor in the elementary and secondary classroom. Thirteen ways in which humor can help teachers to achieve educational goals are presented, specifically that it (1) attracts attention and provokes thought, (2) liberates creative capacities, (3) helps gain friends, (4) improves communication, (5) soothes difficult moments, (6) can stimulate intercultural study, (7) promotes health, (8) develops a positive attitude and self-image, (9) motivates and energizes, (10) solves problems, (11) increases quality and quantity of students' reading, (12) reinforces desired behaviors, and (13) has entertainment value. An age-based, developmental sequence of a child's sense of humor,  derived from various cognitive stage theories, is outlined. Next, the booklet postulates that knowledge of this progression and an awareness of the nature of humor enables teachers to help students analyze their own sense of humor, use humor appropriately in social situations, and speak and write creatively. The physical aspects of humor and the superiority and incongruity theories of humor are discussed and 11 reasons for including humor in one's daily routine to relieve stress are presented. Finally, a list of 49 currently used, practical teaching ideas for employing humor in the classroom are offered. A bibliography is included. (JD)",

For the following reasons, the focus of teacher preparation in this area should be on rhetorical theory: (1) the study of theory informs the practice of teaching, (2) the study of theory is likely to give the beginner an increased sense of professional identity, and (3) the study of theory is valuable for its own sake. Southwest Texas State University provides a graduate seminar in the theory and practice of composition. The syllabus, using Lindemann's &quot;A Rhetoric for Writing Teachers,&quot; provides an overview of the discipline, covering everything from rhetoric, cognition, and linguistics to the evaluation of student essays. The remaining material in the course  consists of readings from professional journals and a sampling of important books written between the early 1970s and the mid 1980s by Emig, Shaughnessy, Moffett, and others. The course makes students think critically about what they do in the classroom, encourages fruitful pedagogical experimentation, and generates an intellectual excitement and a sense of professionalism among the teaching assistants.

If a separate course cannot be implemented, writing teachers might teach word processing and writing in the same course, but not at the same time. However, as the findings of the study suggest, the ideal course for students must do more than separate the early phases of word processing from composition. Teachers must become sensitive to the compatibility of their teaching style with the learning styles of their  students, and modify their techniques accordingly, providing a structure loose enough for students who benefit from autonomy, yet tight enough for those who prefer to work within explicit guidelines. The ideal class should encourage collaborative activities during the word processing and composition phases of the course, have no more than 20 students, and have a ratio of two students per computer at first, then one student per computer once the focus of the course shifts from acquiring the basic word processing skills to independent writing.

In its search for new research audiences and textual formats, the WLF also investigated the effects of altering such givens as author, audience, format, and purpose on the content and texture of theoretical work. WLF developed a conversational approach to educational research that emphasized both the role of narrative in theories of practice and the social functions of writing about research.

Results provided interesting information relative to patterns of performance and their relationship to both the prediction equation and the predictors of writing achievement. The results of the writing assessment in 1984 were more positive for sixth graders than for ninth grade students; the reverse took place in 1985. Findings supported the notion that the best predictors of scores on the North Carolina Annual Writing Assessment using  the CAT are the Reading Total and Language Total subtests. The low to moderate correlations between the North Carolina Annual Writing Assessment and the CAT evidenced the need for a separate measure of writing. The data also indicated that the predictors of writing performance using a standardized achievement measure varied depending on the difficulty of the composing domain assessed, student preparation, and the resulting distribution of scores.

Writing across the curriculum is based on premises such as the following: reading, writing, talking, and listening are the modes through which people think and learn; the more people write the better they learn; and teachers are the primary agents of instruction in the curriculum, and thus the primary agents of educational change. These premises are often introduced to interdisciplinary groups of teachers attending writing seminars and workshops. At such workshops, teachers explore the role of writing in the curriculum and in their subject area by reading works of composition researchers, by writing in journals or logs, by  fulfilling multiple draft assignments, and by collaborating in peer writing groups. Programs developed along these lines have caused noticeable changes in the relationships between (1) teachers and students, by changing the classroom into a place in which both participate as partners in a learning dialogue; (2) teachers and colleagues, by bridging the chasm between composition and literature instruction; (3) teachers and institutions, by challenging the emphasis on research and compartmentalization within institutions; and (4) institutions and society, by empowering students with language awareness, critical thinking, and enlightenment.

        "description":"Aristotle's &quot;Rhetoric&quot; offers a model for applying the concept of the enthymeme to the work of film scholars to understand the role of the audience. Used from an analytic perspective, enthymemes emphasize audience reaction to a film, with the focus on how the film is seen, not on how it was made. Applying viewing skills to a sample of narrative films can demonstrate how the speaker and the audience jointly produce enthymemes. Films, then, make use of appeals to the audience (whether to ethos, pathos, or logos), arranged in deductive and inductive orders according to the enthymematic process. When a film is considered as an argumentative process, therefore, two important aspects of rhetoric stand out: first, the filmic argument is audience dependent in that enthymemes are  completed through participation; and, second, a rhetorical theory of communication, such as Aristotle's, provides a valuable heuristic device for the critic to account for the filmic argument. By considering films as argumentative, the body of critical work on a film appears as perceptions of the argument; the critic must move to a meta-criticism by taking into account these arguments as consequences of the filmic argument.

        "description":"An innovative communication skills laboratory, created in 1971 at the middle school of the Greenburgh School District of New York State, focused on non-verbal communication, as well as the language arts and literature. The laboratory was designed to replace an English program that stigmatized low achievers and separated them from their peers. A workshop involving the laboratory teachers and participants from Teachers College, Columbia, was held during the summer of 1971 to design more specific plans for the laboratory. Participants in the workshop outlined the overall goal of the program: to facilitate students' ability to acquire, interpret, evaluate, and communicate knowledge so that they can use that knowledge to deal sensitively and creatively with their environment. When the  program began, all 270 seventh grade students in the school were assigned a class period in the laboratory. Although it has been used in a variety of ways since its inception, the basic concept of the laboratory as a mechanism for flexible and heterogeneous groups of students to develop skill in language and communication remains.

        "description":"A study examined changes in the treatment of women's issues and feminism from 1975 to 1985--the United Nations (UN) designated &quot;Women's Decade&quot;--by two nationally circulated newspapers. The purpose was to find out how much and what kind of news was reported during the three UN World conferences for women held in 1975, 1980, and 1985; specifically, the study looked at the amount of coverage, placement of stories, tone of stories (degree of conflict emphasized), and use of the terms &quot;feminist&quot; and &quot;feminism.&quot; In all, 80 stories from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; were content analyzed. Results indicated moderate coverage in 1975, scant coverage in 1980, and large coverage in 1985 of the respective conferences. Story placement shifted dramatically over time, from  news pages in 1975 to lifestyle pages in 1980, and to an even division between the two sections in 1985. The use of the terms &quot;feminist&quot; and &quot;feminism&quot; reversed completely in the decade covered, with two-thirds of the stories in 1975 using the words and two-thirds of the stories in 1985 not using them. The one constant in the study was the consistently higher than average number of conflict stories reported (never below 40%), lending support to charges that conflict is over-selected in coverage of the Women's Decade.

Participants were the physicians and physician assistants employed at the clinic. Data were collected through questionnaires before and after the introduction of the innovation. The study hypothesized that the type and strength of communication links between individuals may determine the likelihood with which an individual will adopt an innovative idea. The hypothesis was not supported; several reasons may account for the lack of significant findings: (1) the innovation introduced was not salient for all members of the organization; (2) innovations are not championed  in health care settings; (3) the clinic, like many health care settings, can be classified as a loosely coupled system and characterized as decentralized with a relative lack of coordination; and (4) participants in the study were unable to identify the primary content of their conversation with others and therefore could not identify multiplex links.

        "description":"Noting the call for research that links argument theory with negotiation, this paper examines the nature and function of argument negotiation in current organizational bargaining research theories. Five perspectives are extrapolated to define &quot;argument&quot; and demonstrate how different viewpoints can affect understanding of the negotiation process. The paper argues that although it tends to be a generic term in negotiation studies, how &quot;argument&quot; is defined in organizational bargaining has a great impact on the (1) selection of discourse for analysis, (2) identification of rationality standards for evaluation, and (3) generalizability of results. The nature of human rationality and the established shorthand notation system of argumentation are then examined. The paper investigates  the contrast between the focus of most traditional negotiation studies--determinant solution and mixed motive bargaining--and that of much current research--the motivational and cognitive processes embodied by social psychology. Methodological differences in how both conversational argument and argument fields theories characterize argumentation in the negotiation process are discussed. Finally, the paper critiques the applicability of both theories as frameworks for organizational bargaining and emphasizes that negotiation researchers should be able to articulate their concept of argumentation and to acknowledge its influence on their research.

Interviews with 239 adults produced data concerning (1) the need for cognition, (2) issue domain salience, (3) source reliance, (4) source diversity, (5) source exposure, (6) issue domain differentiation, and (7) domain integration. Support was found for a model in which issue integration is a function of need for cognition and issue salience. Issue differentiation was positively associated with need for cognition and with media source diversity. However, a powerful negative relationship was observed between issue salience and issue differentiation. The findings suggest that source diversity is good predictor of issue-related cognitive effects. By contrast, source exposure and  source reliance appeared to be unrelated to cognitive processes of differentiation and integration. A seven-page bibliography concludes the document. (FL)",

Scripted interactions of eight male and eight female dyads working on math problems were videotaped. In each interaction one actor in the dyad would request non-specific assistance and the other would provide one of four types of responses: (1) answer, (2) procedure, (3) procedure and justification, or (4) procedure and demonstration. Subjects, 62 third and fifth graders, worked on each of the math problems, were shown the videotape of the dyad working on the same problem, then rated the degree to which they thought the reply helped the other actor to understand the math work. Sixty adults who read the scripts of the interactions  also indicated how much they thought the response helped the other actor. Results indicated age-related differences in children's differentiation among different types of replies to requests for information. Older subjects made greater distinctions between replies that only provided them with an answer and those that provided them with information about the process of problem solving. In addition, older subjects were better able to verbalize this distinction. They referred more often to the need for a response that contained information that would teach them the process and allow generalization to future math problems. Appendices provide girl and boy scripts for 3rd and 5th grade stimuli and a description of the coding system for justification of subject's ratings. (HTH)",

The reaction paper argues that time constraints plague both debaters and coaches and discusses the coach's role in the teaching of forensic fundamentals, emphasizing  the need for the coach to understand the new topic at issue. High school coaches should assume the primary function of teaching the fundamentals and college summer institutes should build on those fundamentals within the framework of the current national debate topic.

        "description":"Included in this summary analysis of three journal articles and two documents on teacher evaluation are reports that touch on difficulties facing school officials in developing a teacher evaluation system and suggestions for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of an evaluation system. The first article, by Susan S. Stodolsky, challenges evaluation methods that rely on classroom observation alone and emphasizes the importance on the entire instructional context. The second, a document written by Rand Corporation researchers, concludes from a study of four exemplary school districts that the teacher evaluation process is inseparable from the school district's larger organizational context. The three remaining selections focus on practical aspects of implementing a teacher  evaluation system. In his guide, Thomas L. McGreal identifies nine \"commonalities\" of effective systems that support his conviction that evaluation should help, rather than judge, teachers. Taking the position that some form of summative evaluation is nonetheless needed for making personnel decisions, James Raths and Hallie Preskill offer recommendations to guide administrators through the task of teaching staff assessment. Because of the potential legal implications brought with any personnel decision, the final selection by Donovan Peterson provides guidelines for ensuring that a teacher evaluation system will withstand judicial scrutiny.

        "description":"After implementing changes in language arts instruction, the principal--who is in a key position to sustain or institutionalize the changes--faces several responsibilities. Factors involved in directing innovations to become \"built in\" to school programs include solving specific problems, sharing decision-making responsibilities, upgrading and updating staff competence and commitment, making organizational changes, preventing threats to long-term success, and adapting important factors to school settings. Since most innovations are considered in the context of remedying school problems, educators should determine the nature of local problems. Britain's success with the open classroom concept, for example, was inappropriate for American inner-city school systems. Sustaining a  program involves efforts that are relevant to different school settings, which has been demonstrated by Miles (1983) in a study of 12 elementary and secondary schools. Environmental fluctuations--budget cuts and declining student enrollment--and educator job mobility can threaten the long-term quality of innovations. Preventive strategies include protecting against budget cuts and providing opportunities for individuals to share their competence. Strong leadership, particularly at the middle management level, is vital in carrying out durable language arts innovations. (CJH)",

Online for an 11-week test period in the spring of 1985, the PCN included the following components: a bulletin board for general announcements; elementary and secondary education features boards, containing information from  the &quot;Principals' Yellow Pages&quot;; an electronic mail system for private correspondence; news updates on the latest PCN developments; and a list of all PCN users with their personal and general system statistics. A survey of 38 participating principals showed that the electronic network system can stimulate information exchange among principals. Brevity of the operations period was the biggest drawback; and introducing the program in late spring, a busy time, prevented the full participation of many principals. Principals need more time to learn the system and need access to a home computer for evening and weekend use. (IW)",

To date, however, information about the change process in different school settings has not been considered comparatively. This document examines and compares the process of change and the role of the change facilitator in the context of both the elementary and the secondary school. After a brief review of significant research, the paper analyzes major variables involved in a change effort and presents case studies to illustrate how these variables work in different settings. A comparative synopsis of the findings suggests that effective change at either the elementary or the high school level requires the following: (1) a leader who sanctions  and supports the change; (2) the use of a team of change facilitators; (3) a series of sequential strategies planned around the improvement process; (4) monitoring the system's responses to the implementation strategies; and (5) corrective action if and when the implementation plan strays off target.

Many recent studies have focused, therefore, on school change processes and the formulation of strategies for successful innovation implementation. These studies, however, have not formulated the means for determining if, or how, individual teachers have integrated innovation into their regular classroom practice. This paper offers a definition of institutionalization that addresses this problem, first by describing five subprocesses (assessment of present practices, response adoption, initiation, implementation, and institutionalization); then by offering a set of three vectors  for describing innovation use (Stages of Concern, Levels of Use, and Innovation Configuration); and finally by explaining how these vectors can be used to determine if an innovation has become institutionalized.

Through this research, much has been learned about the school improvement process and what facilitators do on a daily basis to bring about change. This paper provides research-based suggestions for (1) selecting and placing effective facilitators and (2) training persons to become effective facilitators of change. The research discussed in this paper is grounded in the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) and the Principal-Teacher Interaction Study, which focused on the role of principals as the major facilitators of change in their schools. Selection of educational leaders  can be partially based on styles (&quot;responder,&quot;&quot;manager,&quot; or &quot;initiator&quot;). It can also be based on the needs of the specific situation and the interactions among change facilitation teams. The process of training should include an entire change facilitation team and extend over a sustained time period, providing opportunities for applications and feedback.

        "description":"This paper provides a perspective on issues among small schools in Canada through an analysis of topics that focus on Ontario. During the early phase of the small school movement, many educators believed that &quot;small&quot; represented a deleterious condition. After researchers examined negative conditions among larger schools, however, educators reconsidered the benefits of small schools and now regard them as having unique educational settings. What constitutes a small school and a quality curriculum are current issues. Enrollment declines in Ontario secondary schools have led to contraction of program offerings, but quality is not necessarily measured by the number of courses. Research is needed that distinguishes between the effects of ruralness and of smallness. Under the scrutiny  of the public, media, researchers, and futurists, the checking for quality and for social responsiveness will reveal both positive and negative characteristics of small schools. With the impetus toward individualized instruction, the effects of distance, isolation, and curriculum breadth could be erased by information technologies. The ministry should support small schools for their unique needs. Research needs include longitudinal studies of small school students and analysis of school strategies. University teacher education programs should provide greater preparation for small or rural settings. (CJH)",

Administrators should work toward improved building cleanliness by insisting on a school board policy that establishes objectives for the custodial department. Principals have many duties and managing the custodial staff is often relagated to lower priority than providing \"instructional leadership.\" A formula is needed for custodial staff allocations and should include factors such as number of children and adults using the building and extent of extracurricular and community activities. Custodial job descriptions should include specific task assignments. Responsibilities should encompass  inspections, preventive maintenance, regulation compliance, inventory maintenance, and emergencies. A daily schedule stating tasks, tools, and time allotments should be supplemented with weekly and seasonal schedules. Job enrichment for custodians can be achieved by expanding the custodian's role to include care of flower beds and shrubs, window replacement, and preventive maintenance, such as periodic oiling of motors, changing of furnace filters, repairing leaky faucets and replacing motor belts. Recognition of custodians promotes morale and can be accomplished by issuing custodial uniforms or even ordering business cards for them. (CJH)",

Section 1, &quot;The Challenge,&quot; suggests that societal changes make an education industry outside the K-12 system attractive, although the industry's foundation is dependent on the public system. The section discusses the growing &quot;non-school&quot; education industry and recommends that entrepreneurial teachers be encouraged in order to retain talent. Section 2, &quot;Constraints against Innovation within the Existing Structure,&quot; describes how regulations stifle teacher incentives. &quot;The Creative Response: Entrepreneurism among Teachers,&quot; section 3, analyzes  a partnership's legal aspects, contract terms, and the result of greater work environment control by teachers. Section 4, &quot;Potential Obstacles to Implementation,&quot; explains that contracting need not compromise school conditions or the status of administrators and teacher organizations. The document recommends that partnerships be defined by law, that accountability reside with a partnership's certified teacher operators, and that students be protected through district evaluation of partnerships. Section 5, &quot;Demonstrating the Idea's Effectiveness,&quot; discusses selection of a demonstration site. The summary concludes that a competitive, professional model for educational services provides a coherent mechanism of promoting excellence. (CJH)",

        "description":"This monograph analyzes trends in American educational philosophy and history in its proposal to implement an all-public statewide school voucher system. Following an introduction, section 1, &quot;Alternative Voucher Systems,&quot; discusses three concepts: universal unregulated vouchers, favored by Milton Friedman; regulated compensatory vouchers, developed by Christopher Jencks; and &quot;power-equalizing&quot; vouchers. &quot;Vouchers and Private Schools,&quot; section 2, raises the issue of religious schools. &quot;The Administrative Dilemma in Vouchers for Private Schools,&quot; section 3, concludes that a system including religious schools is not feasible. The legal fate of vouchers depends upon the operative &quot;child benefit&quot; theory--that the purpose is to benefit the child, not the school. Section 4, &quot;All-Public  Vouchers,&quot; cites California as a likely candidate for a public model because of the centralization trend. Nationwide, the &quot;excellence&quot; movement expresses centralization, though local control remains a commitment. The trends are reconciled by state-funded vouchers with a statewide open enrollment system. A school would, as today, verify enrollment, and thereby earn its governmental income. Student mobility is handled by budgeting according to days attended. Equalizing school finance leads to free movement and dissolution of boundaries, permitting significant racial integration. Twenty-two endnotes are included. (CJH)",

Section 1, &quot;The School as Community Center,&quot; analyzes sharing school facilities with community organizations and easing fiscal constraints through cost-sharing. &quot;Attracting and Retaining the Best Teachers,&quot; section 2, calls for a multifaceted strategy, including measures to improve teacher morale and the creation of nontraditional teaching opportunities. Credentialing should be changed to attract unusually qualified people, even if only for temporary assignments. Contracting for specialized instructional services should be a common practice. Schools could cooperate with local industry  to recruit outstanding teachers. Section 3, &quot;Reducing the Number of Administrators,&quot; discusses the growth of administrators as a percentage of public school personnel. School performance improves if resources are redirected away from administration and into the instructional program. Section 4, &quot;More Challenging Homework,&quot; challenges teachers to treat homework as an integral part of curriculum. Without cost, educational effectiveness is achieved if homework is relevant to students' community life and is organized into group projects. References are included in each of the document's four sections. (CJH)",

Three of these factors relate to those engaged in learning: their stages of individual development, their tendency toward initial dependence, and their needs to master and to belong. Three more factors relate to the setting in which the learning takes place: the use of student assessment, the grouping of students from disparate backgrounds (including different educational organizations), and the dynamics of group teaching. The last two factors considered in the paper relate to course content: first, the goodness of fit between the teaching styles adopted and the learning objectives sought, and second, the effectiveness of the  different degrees and types of \"reality\" of the content, particularly in light of the level of economic development of the countries from which the students come. A 19-item checklist based on the paper's conclusions regarding these factors is provided as a tool for use in assessing program effectiveness. (PGD)",

        "description":"This paper explores certain dilemmas in the professional preparation of school administrators, particularly in developing nations. The paper begins by reviewing the issue of specialist preparation and development for educational administrators, examining arguments for and against specialist training. A discussion of the extent of Canada's commitment to professional training for educational administrators provides a context in which to describe a framework developed in Manitoba for planning the preservice and continuing development of administrators. This framework hinges on the establishment of a strong link between the purposes of and the delivery methods for professional training. The framework assumes the existence of a continuum of skills important to administrators, the need  to assess an administrator's progress along the continuum, and the need to develop preservice and inservice programs that take both the skills to be taught and the skills already learned into account. Although preservice programs should probably focus on basic &quot;survival&quot; skills and inservice programs on skills for handling problems developing in practice, the traditional content of such programs is usually the reverse, as a discussion of Manitoba's system illustrates. The paper concludes by applying these observations to the unique situation found in the Caribbean. (PGD)",

Although the Commonwealth Caribbean consists of 16 unique and sovereign nations, these nations are sufficiently similar socially, culturally, politically, and economically to permit this paper's examination of educational administration in the region as a whole. The paper begins by describing broadly the political, social, and economic forces at work in the region. Among the major themes are liberation, production, pacification, social stratification, culture and socialization, and financial support for education. Common traditions in educational administration are reviewed next, including inservice &quot;apprenticeship&quot; for  administrators, the administrator's roles as community leader and social role model, the autonomy of administrators, and central control of administration. Given these factors, certain specific needs of educational administration in the region can be identified, including the need for a thorough and complete description of the current state of the field, the need to develop theory suitable to the situation identified, the need to test the theory thus developed, and finally, the need to act on the results of this process rather than prior to careful study.

Madaus argues that, although tests serve some useful functions, treating them as a major mechanism for reforming education is questionable. Peter A. Garcia examines the negative impact of testing on minority teachers and minorities attempting to enter educational training programs in Texas. Gregory R. Anrig notes that tests have a legitimate even though limited function and urges policymakers to ensure their proper use. In reviewing legal issues, Joseph C. Beckham focuses on constraints courts have imposed on teacher competency testing. Procedures used to validate the National Teacher Examinations as accurate measures of competency are discussed by Lawrence H.  Cross. The final selection summarizes positions taken by the two leading teacher unions in two journal articles, one by Rita Hodgkins and Bernard McKenna and the other by Albert Shanker and Gordon Ward. Although differing over the use of tests, they agree that teacher competency needs to be assessed. (CJH)",

        "description":"In view of the emphasis on money as a motivator mentioned in reports examining theoretical notions about teacher motivation, this paper focuses on the efficacy of using salary to attract quality teacher candidates. Although standarized testing and internship programs often supplement inadequate certification requirements, critics question the relationship of testing to classroom effectiveness and to higher quality applicants. Jacob W. Getzel's theory of social behavior, as applied by Morphet et al., suggests that effective school leadership extends opportunities to teachers to meet both personal and school objectives. Maslow's theory of motivation provides an avenue for understanding individual needs as motivators of behavior. Today, according to Yankelovitch, the attitude of  younger employees toward their work and workplace is that the present incentive system is so unappealing that they are no longer motivated to work hard. A derived implication is an administrative style that is supportive of a teacher's inner locus of control. The Coleman report discovered that local affluence is the basis for setting teacher salaries--not teacher quality. While money incentives are necessary, they are insufficient alone, for knowledge about what motivates teacher performance is necessary. The teacher's experience of the school environment has a great impact on quality, which involves administrator quality. Morphet and others (1982) perceive the traditional behavior of administrators as one of the major stumbling blocks to curriculum improvement. Included are 33  references. (CJH)",

        "description":"A survey of 135 Pennsylvania regular classroom teachers (kindergarten through grade 8) examined their understanding of learning disabilities (LD) and the degree to which they felt prepared to work with LD students. The survey sought information on: (1) teacher preparation, knowledge, and experience related to identifying and working with LD students; (2) teacher knowledge of characteristics of LD students; and (3) teacher definition and concept of LD. Thirty-six percent of the respondents had received preservice training and 43 percent had attended an inservice workshop dealing with LD. However, 82 percent of the teachers reported that they had identified or referred a child as LD, but only 21% felt they sufficiently understood the concept to approximately identify and serve LD  children. Teachers identified the five same LD characteristics most frequently--attention deficits, perceptual disorders, reading difficulties, oral language problems and motor problems. Teachers also frequently cited performance discrepancy and low frustration tolerance as LD characteristics. Results indicate that there is considerable confusion about learning disabilities among teachers who are being asked to identify, refer, and serve children who have learning problems. (CB)",

The highest percentage of mobility problems occurred in the under-18 and over-65 age groups. Antipsychotic drugs were prescribed for 54% of clients over age 65. After age 65, decided decrements were observed in independent functioning, physical development,  self-direction, and socialization. Clients in this age group also lived in the most restricted residential environments. Significant increases were noted in the upper two age groups in self-abusive behaviors and hyperactive tendencies, as measured by Part II of the Adaptive Behavior Scale. Additional results are presented, and the interpretation and implications of data are discussed in terms of programming for older developmentally disabled adults. References and tables are appended.

        "description":"This book deals with the promotion of body awareness through use of educational gymnastics, with handicapped or non-handicapped but poorly coordinated children of all age levels. The method provides an analytical approach to movement, encourages children to listen to language, and assists them in creating their own activities. The activities and suggestions included in the book have been used with children with various conditions, including autism, deafness-blindness, hearing loss, Down's Syndrome, mental retardation, hyperactivity, spina bifida, muscular abnormalities, lack of confidence, poor sequential memory, poor understanding of body and spatial awareness, lack of knowledge of directional concepts, aphasia, learning difficulties, and poor motor coordination. The first  section of the book provides an overview of the program's rationale and discusses promotion of body awareness, lesson format, and equipment. Section 2 contains descriptions and illustrations (photographs and drawings) of activities to develop body movement and awareness. Activities are listed for each part of the lesson format: introductory activity, general body movement, weight on two hands, push and pull, foot exercises, class activities, and group activities. The third section presents sample lesson programs for poorly-coordinated children and for very (multiply or severely) handicapped children. Ways in which to record student progress are suggested. An appendix contains posture models which can be used to teach children correct body posture. (CB)",

Thirty-six parents were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups which completed pre- and post-measures of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDS). Participants in the treatment group attended weekly 2-hour classes for 10 weeks, during which they were taught (1) self-monitoring of stressful events and their physiological reactions to those events; (2) muscle relaxation skills; and (3) modification of cognitions associated with distress. Analysis of descriptive measures showed that the groups were equivalent in regard to age, income, education, social  support, stress, and the child's maladaptive behavior. Among results was that the experimental group, which had a higher overall measure of depression at pretest than did the control group, had a lower overall measure of depression at posttest, while the control group's depression score increased slightly. Analysis of the social validation measures showed that participating parents rated all elements of the treatment positively. A 36-item reference list is appended. (JW)",

Parents completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) upon entrance to the program and again after 6 months. Systematic family-oriented intervention provided to the experimental group included transdisciplinary assessment, development of an individualized education program for each child, free-play observation of parent and child, assessment of family needs, an individualized family plan, sessions with a family therapist, crisis counseling as needed, and optional participation  in parent and sibling groups. Post-intervention PSI scores for the experimental group indicated a significant decrease in stress related to the child's adaptation and demandingness, while parental perception of child mood was significantly improved. PSI scores for the comparison group did not change over the 6-month period. (Author/JW)",

Concern with this increasing number of children identified as learning disabled and lack of success with the traditional pull-out resource program led the school district of Independence, Missouri, to develop the Focus Curriculum Program for third graders (LD and non-handicapped) scoring below the 30th percentile in reading. The Curriculum provides an all-day program focused on reading instruction and  follows principles demonstrated by the effective schools research including increasing student time-on-task, improving the quality of teacher-pupil interactions, and lowering the teacher-student ratio. Students spend between one and three academic quarters in the program. Preliminary results with 56 LD students indicate the intervention had a significant effect on reading scores and that this improvement was sustained a year later in the regular fourth grade. Problems have included difficulties with reintegration into the regular class and reluctance by LD resource teachers to believe that so much growth is possible in such a short time. Expansion of the program might provide students with needed remedial help before they are identified as learning disabled. (DB)",

        "description":"A product of a statewide (California) survey of 104 school districts and 9 county educational agencies, the report focuses on promising practices for use with handicapped children of limited English proficiency (LEP). In Phase One, seven categories of promising practices or program attributes were identified:(1) first and second language development, (2) cultural considerations, (3) teacher competencies and staff development, (4) administrative interface and collaboration, (5) nonbiased assessment, (6) educational placement and programming, and (7) parent involvement. The area of promising practice most frequently identified by survey participants was nonbiased assessment. Major findings of the Phase Two survey of current educational practices included the proportional  representation of LEP students in special education, frequent consideration of language problems in the assessment of LEP students, and a Spanish emphasis. The third phase involved compiling an annotated bibliography on the professional literature dealing with special education services for the culturally and/or linguistically different handicapped student. The 112 citations which make up the bulk of this publication are grouped according to the seven categories of promising practices. The final phase is an analysis and summary of findings for each of the seven categories. The need for the field to focus more on qualitative questions of program placement and educational delivery as well as on ways to more meaningfully involve parents is stressed. Appendices provide (1) a breakdown of the  components of each of the promising practices categories, and (2) a set of forms describing promising practices of various school districts. Twelve pages of references are also provided. (DB)",

The survey was part of a larger project undertaken by the Systematic Collaborative Outreach Project Effort (SCOPE). A representational sample of teachers (N=308) and administrators (N=47) from small, medium, and large day schools and from medium or large residential programs was surveyed. Respondents were queried for the following information: (1) a curriculum description; (2) processes used for curriculum development and monitoring; (3) curriculum training efforts; (4) use of instructional materials; and (5) curriculum review and revision procedures. Results indicated that large day school programs were most likely to have documented curriculum components. Both day and residential schools  affirmed a need to use curriculum specifically designed for deaf students; however, day schools more often choose to or were required to modify existing state curricula, while residential schools more often chose to develop their own curricula. Large programs reported providing a greater variety of training activities than did smaller programs. Teachers were often responsible for developing, monitoring, reviewing, and revising curricula. School officials and teachers relied more on internal than external sources to identify strengths and weaknesses in their curricula. Resultant recommendations focus on training activities for teachers, documentation of curriculum components, teacher use of print media, and information dissemination of available curricula. Appendices include the  administrators' survey instrument, the teachers' survey instrument, and graphs of data. (CB)",

        "description":"The paper presents the thesis that mild mental subnormality developed as a &quot;scientific,&quot; hence natural, explanation for the socially unacceptable behavior of economically marginal persons. The history of such labels as &quot;moron,&quot;&quot;imbecile,&quot; and &quot;moral imbecile&quot; is traced to the late 19th century emphasis on biology and genetics in human affairs. This focus led to the belief that criminal behavior was caused by mental deficiency and thus provided justification for massive institutionalization of people who did not meet societal expectations. The development of intelligence tests led to what was considered a scientific method of identifying the feebleminded. The need for manpower in World War II resulted in the discovery that many &quot;feebleminded&quot; persons could perform at higher  levels than had previously been thought and some special educators credited special education with the new competence of the feebleminded. After the war new classification systems evolved based on social competence. Definitions of mental retardation by the American Association on Mental Deficiency included the construct of &quot;adaptive behavior&quot; which was difficult to measure reliably. Despite current confusion regarding definition, the mildly retarded of today are still drawn from economically marginal backgrounds. Thus mild mental subnormality continues to be as much a political as a scientific issue. A six-page reference list concludes the document. (DB)",

The evaluation, which assessed the impact of the centers in increasing opportunities for disabled individuals, was based upon data acquired through mail survey of 156 centers funded in 1984-85; 2,700 disabled consumers of center services, and 180 local community agencies; and on-site interviews with consumers, center staff, and community agency representatives in 40 centers. Among findings were that more than 48,000 disabled persons were served by the 121 responding centers; that 75% of the 990 responding consumers were severely disabled; that the centers provided a wide range of services (i.e., advocacy, independent living  skills training, peer counseling); that Part B funds comprised 44% of center budgets with three-fourths of budgets going to direct client services; and that over 90% of consumer respondents reported gaining from center services. Following the executive summary and introduction, this report presents an overview of the program, characteristics of center consumers, services provided, consumer outcomes, consumer participation, descriptions of the development of community options for independnet living, and information regarding management of the centers. Six appendices present such information as the development of evaluation standards, study methodology, and a summary of performance on each evaluation standard. (DB)",

Section III contains four papers which discuss medical and sociocultural aspects of disability such as Blacks and physical disability and the role of disabled Hispanics. The impact of media, technology, and assistive technologies on the nonwhite  disabled population is considered in the three papers in Section IV. The fifth section discusses preparation of professionals and career development for the disabled and contains five papers which look at college based training, the training of speech-language pathologists, access for nonwhite disabled students to community colleges, nontraditional career approaches, and a New York work experience program. The final section contains five papers which pertain to the development and utilization of community-based resources, support systems (the Black church, local resources), and political means, and advocacy mechanisms to promote rehabilitation of the nonwhite disabled.

The first section describes the current state of the art with regard to personnel practices, the changing roles and responsibilities of paraprofessionals, training programs, certification/permit systems, and other factors affecting the employment, training, and on-the-job performance of paraprofessionals. The report's second section presents a series of recommendations for improving the effectiveness of paraprofessionals in special education and its related services. These recommendations are based on a national survey  of special education directors (N=52) representing 47 state departments of education, three United States territories, the District of Columbia, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Information obtained from these administrators (number of paraprofessionals employed in special education programs, reimbursement policies, certification policies, cooperative state-college relationships, professional needs, and training networks) resulted in the formation of several conclusions, including the need for systematic inservice training, easier access to postsecondary education, differentiated staffing patterns, and increased cooperation between state and local education agencies.

The project is thought to be the first in the nation to describe the characteristics of students referred to SSTs, the modifications/interventions undertaken on their behalf, and the effects of the modifications/interventions on the students. Among findings on SST processes is the expressed need for better ways to provide student followup. Findings on the analysis of 194 student referrals indicated that the most often reported problem categories were in the areas of general academic performance, social/emotional adjustment,  academic behavior, and reading. Recommendations made to policy makers, trainers, school staff, parents, and students included: the need for federal, state, and local policy-makers to permit local schools to decide for themselves about establishing and operating SST processes at their schools; the need for trainers to heed school staff reports on their need for assistance in following up on recommendations for interventions and modifications; the need for parents to accept the school's invitation to participate in an SST; and the need for students to bring themselves to the attention of SSTs if needed.

The system follows a momentary time-sampling approach and tracks individual children across all activities in a typical preschool day allowing for the recording of 12 categories of these variables. The ESCAPE system allows coding for (1) the variety of adults who interact with the child, (2) teacher behaviors directed specifically to a target child, and (3) simultaneous occurrences of three different categories of student behavior. Data can be summarized to represent  the percentages of time the target child spends engaged in each coded variable or unconditional probabilities to indicate the probability of various student behaviors given a specific arrangement of ecological variables. Pilot data on 12 children illustrate the system's potential application with process-product program evaluation. Implications of expanding the focus of process assessment beyond student behavior to include ecological and teacher behavior variables within early intervention program evaluation research are discussed.

The teacher's guide stresses the importance of positive parent-child interactions, addresses specific problems of some children (such as lack of mobility or perseveration) during play, and offers suggestions for guiding children through play experiences. An initial section provides background information on play including social stages and cognitive levels of play, play and the handicapped child, enhancing play for children with specific handicapping conditions, observing children at play, and adult involvement in child's play. Specific guidelines for planning and conducting a play workshop for parents include a workshop planning  checklist, a sample invitation, suggested workshop displays and activities, workshop discussion questions, and suggested handouts. The last section offers recommendations for maintaining interest in play throughout the year. Eighteen supplemental activity sheets give suggestions for such activities as &quot;dressing up,&quot; using &quot;throw-aways&quot; for play, and exploring the outdoors. Sample newsletters and monthly calendars with play ideas are also included. A list of about 90 resources for parents and teachers is appended. The parent booklet, illustrated with photographs, provides 20 one-page suggestions for play activities with handicapped children. Activities include make believe with boxes, kitchen play, blowing bubbles, and sand play. Resources for parents and teachers fill seven pages; a  two-page bibligraophy is also provided. (DB)",

Using a trainer of trainers model, the project conducted workshops and produced a training package which includes a program development handbook and an instructor's guide (the latter is included in this document as Appendix A). The handbook, published earlier, describes the principles, advantages, processes, and techniques for involving industry volunteers in special education. The handbook includes seven program planning steps and implementation guidelines for management orientation, community/public relations, recruitment of employee volunteers, applicant  screening, referral for placement, performance monitoring, recognition and appreciation, and program evaluation. Use of the materials at 30 training workshops with a total of over 500 participants around the country is reported. Appendix A, &quot;Workshop on Volunteerism in Special Education through Industry-Related Cooperation: An Organizer's and Trainer's Guide,&quot; includes information on organizing for the workshop, conducting the workshop, and follow-up. The guide also includes such information as position titles of target workshop participants, draft letters and brochures, a suggested workshop agenda, and evaluation forms. Appendix B is a third party evaluation report which concludes that the program was successful in meeting its objectives as demonstrated by the number of volunteer  programs developed following the training sessions.

Semantic mapping is a vocbulary strategy which produces the interaction between prior knowledge in a graphic form. For purposes of vocabulary development, semantic mapping extends knowledge by displaying words in categories to help familiarize the learner with new words in relation to known words. Ten steps for teaching with semantic mapping include selecting the focal word or concept, asking the students to think of as many words as possible related to the focal word or concept, using the target words in sentences, and finally, reading the selection. The  procedure of semantic mapping is also applied to the identification of words through the mapping of word families. A three-page list of references and three examples of mapping are offered.

Among family services provided were the following: assistance in implementing home- and community-based individualized education programming (IEP) objectives;  social integration activities; activities to develop recreational and leisure skills; and respite care.

A hypothetical situation involving a regular classroom and resource teacher consulting with each other regarding a student with learning and behavioral problems was used as a reference for responding to a 20-item questionnaire. Results suggested a strong preference by regular and special educators for a collaborative model for problem-solving.  Implications for training and practice are discussed in the context of perceived limitations of the study with relation to such factors as the sample itself, the instrumentation, and the design of the study. Respondents also provided information on personal background, current professional employment, and training/experience in consultation.

Subjects were 12 fourth- and fifth-grade males at a residential school for the deaf, six of whom had been identified as potentially learning disabled. The other six students were considered to be achieving normally. All students were administered the Slosson Oral Reading Test and three subtests of the American School Achievement Tests (Intermediate Battery). Results indicated that all but one of the deaf students predicted by teachers to be  in the learning disabled group had similar characteristics.

These species are defined by their internal structure, determined by genetics in the case of living things and by chemical or physical properties in the case of others. The reference of these terms is determined by these properties, but the properties are not semantically associated with the terms in question because the terms were introduced before science discovered the internal structure properties. Therefore, some of the terms are nondescriptional. Two theorists, Kripke and Putnam, have shown that in the case of this group of natural kind terms, humans let the natural essence or properties function as Locke's nominal essence, or sense. This is  supported by evidence from a study of language use in ten-year-olds. However, this class of terms is smaller than was previously thought, and some questions about it remain, including the function of nondescriptional terms within the language, possible grammatical correlates of nondescriptionality, the relationship between descriptionality and decompositionality, and learnability.

One of the two groups was made up of native English speakers, while the other consisted of beginning learners of English as a second language. The analysis finds a pattern of shared interaction very different from that found in numerous studies of classroom discourse. In it, both participants, student and teacher, introduce topics and ask questions. Analysis of the form and type of teacher questions to individual students reveals considerable variation in both, related to the student's English proficiency level. This variation is similar to patterns found in native speaker-nonnative speaker interactions. Analysis of student questions and responses to teacher questions reveals  increased student participation in the interaction over time. These findings suggest that dialogue journals offer a useful supplement to traditional classroom discourse, and perhaps a model that can be transferred to other interactions in the classroom context.

The study used two methodological approaches: a comparison of journal language with that used in speech and other written samples, and a longitudinal look at change patterns that also examined which morphemes were being acquired and which were not. Four major findings emerged: (1) some morphemes, including the use of &quot;be&quot; as a copula, were mastered quickly, while others showed little or no gain over time; (2) while there were some overall trends common to all students, there was also considerable individual variation in the acquisition processes, seemingly as a result of first language transfer; (3) dialogue journal  writing does reflect changes in language proficiency over time, even at the earliest stages of language learning; and (4) ESL learners can compose and express themselves in English long before they have mastered its forms and structures.

However, the conspicuous lack of success of second language learners has caused researchers to seek evidence in experimental data. The most expedient source of this data is grammaticality judgments, and they present problems of reliability and validity. More trustworthy elicitation techniques have been developed, but grammaticality judgments are still being used with few methodological safeguards. The most serious barrier to the development of a \"principled theory\" of second language learning appears to be reliance on unprincipled data. (MSE)",

        "description":"Intensive summer language schools are designed to increase student exposure to the target language, both in quantity and type. One way to increase student interest in the input is for a journalism class to produce a daily student newspaper in the target language. Such a project has gained popularity at a Portland, Oregon intensive German summer school. The newspaper project holds the interest of these intensive language students, for it allows them to read about up to the minute news events in the target language, ridding them of any feelings of isolation from the real world. The publication's language is usually quite simple since it is created by students for students, and it can report campus, local, and world news. The skills practiced in producing the newspaper go beyond  classroom language skills, entailing news gathering, class discussion, interviewing and other specialized information gathering, translation, and organization and composition of the articles. It has been found to be an extremely time-efficient activity because of the intensive student participation. Students have also sharpened journalistic skills, German keyboard use, and word separation skills. Undergraduate or beginning graduate courses in which the students have had some advanced composition and conversation and are interested in improving, accelerating, and diversifying their writing skills, are best suited for this kind of course.

        "description":"Research indicates that writing can be an important vehicle for integrating all the learning that occurs in a foreign language. However, a number of factors have conspired to displace foreign language writing as a critical skill: the push for oral proficiency, departmental fragmentation, larger class sizes, and heavier faculty loads. Second language instruction should both teach the mechanics of writing in the target language and stress that writing builds critical thinking skills and ultimately produces more proficient writers in both native and second languages. This argument can be illustrated through an analysis of currently used oral language proficiency rating guidelines and their relationship to cognitive skill development. Second language prewriting strategies and writing  assignments used in one college French curriculum are designed based on principles of native language writing instruction and include sentence-combining and critical text reading exercises, description and composition assigments, a mock press conference, a simulated travel diary, sequenced assignments on cultural topics, student paper exchanges, and dialectical journals.

However, political and economic developments during and since the colonial era have created sociolinguistic contexts, motives, and results of the language's status that are very different for each country. In Indonesia, the policies of the Indonesian nationalists, Dutch, and Japanese converged to promote Bahasa Indonesia successfully as an ethnically neutral symbol of identity and integration. In Malaysia, the selection and promotion of Bahasa Malaysia as the national language was motivated partly by ethnic communalism rather than national unity, but it was also enhanced by British and  Japanese policy. In Singapore, Malay serves to express international integration and unity with her two closest neighbors and is a factor in the balance of ethnic sentiments. The status and domains of Malay in the three countries are constantly changing and evolving, reflecting the complexities of the national language question in this area.

The most frequent single problem in installing a national language is not related to vocabulary expansion, spelling or grammmar standardization, the adequacy of the educational system, or the presence of an ensconced colonial language, but is often simply that there is no language that a sufficiently large majority of the citizens will accept as a symbol of national identity.

        "description":"In keeping with the increased use of computers in schools, the available software for foreign language instruction has grown to over 1,000 titles, mostly of the drill and practice type, and professional associations are reviewing software and computer-related instructional techniques. However, there seems to be no clear direction for the future of microcomputer use in foreign language education at this time, and developments in the profession seem to have reached a plateau. The next few years, seen as the second wave of computer use, will be spent determining where and how computer-based instruction fits into the perceived goals and directions of foreign language teaching in general, with increased emphasis on the accountability of the technology. Problems persist in the  production, evaluation, and availability of high-quality software for classroom use. However, the cost of hardware continues to decrease, and technological advancements and adaptations hold considerable promise for foreign language instruction. In addition, innovative networking and telecommunications arrangements are beginning to link teachers, students, and instructional materials at long distances and with little expense. (MSE)",

        "description":"Those who warn that the United States is handicapped by a state of international illiteracy are concerned both that Americans are unable to communicate in other languages and that most are unprepared to operate with sensitivity in cross-cultural situations. Culture refers to the view of the world shared by members of a group, the patterns of behavior deriving from that view, and the utilitarian and expressive forms evolving from both. For many years, foreign language departments concentrated on presenting culture as events of history in the context of art, music, and literature. The profession now seems committed to teaching the sociological aspects of culture as well as traditional civilization content, focusing on language as a manifestation of culture. The most valuable  benefits from studying another culture are humility, awareness of one's own culture, and the understanding that difference is not a negative quality. The foreign language profession is currently working to better define the goals of cultural education. Materials for cultural instruction should be context-rich, experience-based, and have the foreign language as their focus. Despite the large amount of time needed to teach both language and culture, the two are best taught together, holistically, in order to achieve international understanding. (MSE)",

Although somewhat different versions are used in different testing situations, the OI always consists of a structured, face-to-face conversation on a variety of topics between a student and one or two testers. The resulting speech sample is rated on a scale whose specific range is determined by the testing agency. The OI was developed by the Foreign Service Institute and has been refined continuously by the Interagency Language Roundtable. The proficiency scale and interview have attracted increased interest in academic circles, both for testing and as an organizing principle for developing curriculum. They have demonstrated a high degree of reliability and  validity, and the OI is appropriate when proficiency testing is warranted or desired, as for placement testing, before and after intensive language training, before and after living abroad, at the end of a major sequence of high school or college courses, for course equivalency, for teacher certification, and for assessing language program effectiveness. Formal tester training and certification are available through professional associations, and individuals can also have their own proficiency tested by contacting certified testers through the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.

A short-term overseas program can take several forms, but the combination of travel with study and a homestay is preferred for promoting growth in foreign language ability and appreciation, international awareness, adaptability, non-materialism, and independence and responsibility. School administrators need information about the legal and insurance aspects of such a program as well as particulars concerning quality, itinerary, costs,  program administration, and past program record in order to choose or approve adoption of a program. Details to be organized or investigated include provisions for transportation, lodging, meals, tips, entertainment, gifts, passports and visas, insurance, baggage, medical treatment, and student screening. Student orientation should focus on cultural similarities and differences and on language abilities and personal skills needed to adjust to the new environment. The use of role-playing, simulation, and reading a variety of related books is also recommended. (MSE)",

They are usually offered in middle and junior high schools, to give students in the young adolescent stage of development a chance to explore a range of academic and vocational fields. They originated in the 1920s, but lost popularity to elementary school sequential language courses and were revived only in the 1970s. Course content generally consists of general language study conducted in English, trial study of several languages, or a combination. It may also include Latin, the United States' language heritage, career awareness, and languages not included in the school curriculum. Implementation requires a detailed  curriculum and guide, a basic daily lesson format including foreign language practice, exercises linking the foreign language with English skills and vocabulary building, culture, phrase review, and songs. Scheduling can be very flexible. The teachers are most often foreign language teachers, but all should have an orientation session. Materials can be adapted from those already used in social studies and foreign language departments. Some successful school district programs are willing to share their experiences and materials.

Foreign language teacher education has not changed much since the 1960s. Most programs consist of subject-matter content, general education requirements, and specialized education courses. Teacher trainee supervisors do not always have experience in foreign language instruction. Legislatively and politically, foreign language teacher education shares many characteristics and problems with other teacher education areas, but competency to teach a foreign language differs in one fundamental way from most other subject areas in that a foreign language teacher cannot compensate for subject-matter (language) deficiencies through short-term research alone. This  makes language competence a more crucial long-range consideration in teacher training. Indications of improvement in foreign language teacher education include a shift in emphasis from teacher training to teacher development, increased focus on teacher self-assessment, and an expressed desire for higher program accreditation standards. A tendency toward isolationism in foreign language teacher education points up the need for a unique knowledge base within the profession, leading to more enlightened teacher preparation. (MSE)",

Foreign language students develop not only technical skills related to language use but also tangible advantages in the job market because of their increased communication skills. Mastery of languages also enhances the enjoyment of travel abroad and reduces frustration and isolation during travel in other countries. Increased international business opportunities have made meaningful communication and understanding between cultures more valuable, and the individual's ability to understand and empathize across cultural lines is increased with language study. In addition, research suggests that foreign language study enhances both cognitive development and academic  achievement. While it is certain that people familiar with more than one language and culture can communicate more effectively with people of other countries and cultures, it is also possible that through learning another language and culture, people become more effective problem-solvers, closer to achieving solutions to pressing social problems because of an increased awareness of a wider set of options.

The studies show that language learners use avoidance strategies to different extents, irrespective of age, native language, or target language. They also give only very general clues about the overall use of avoidance at different learning levels and suggest that reliable classification of communication strategies is difficult.

        "description":"Formal and functional similarities in a learner's first and second languages (L1 and L2) facilitate the perception of cross-linguistic equivalence between individual items (phonemes, morphemes, words, and phrases). The beginning foreign language learner makes frequent use of these perceived equivalences when he learns to understand L2 items. This receptive competence in turn creates a basis for development of productive competence. Cross-linguistic similarities alone may not directly facilitate the mastery of L2 systems for use in production, but the learner who can easily perceive cross-linguistic equivalences will easily build a basic receptive competence that can be converted into productive competence. Furthermore, although the L2 learner whose L1 is a related language may  have problems with minimally distinct patterns and other factors, he will probably make fewer errors that seriously affect communication than the learner whose L1 and L2 are not related.

The experiment examined the ability of intermediate and advanced second language students to comprehend sentences at a critical point: when they have recognized the thematically critical word, are processing the next word, the target verb, and are continuing to monitor other words in the text. It was found that for advanced students whose processing capacity is not burdened by microprocesses, the effects of the sentence's topical structure in facilitating or inhibiting comprehension are clear. For less advanced students whose  comprehension of the topic in the preceding context is probably less efficient, topical discontinuity in the preceding context does not have as consistent an effect.

While both private and public education are considered, the public sector is emphasized. Governance is defined as both formal decision arrangements and informal procedures by which standards are maintained. Information was obtained from a survey of decision-making in state higher education agencies, flagship universities, four-year colleges, and two-year colleges. After discussing the mission of universities, the tradition of self-regulation in American higher education is examined, including the governing board and  voluntary accreditation. Also covered are outside governance connections (the state, the federal government, and the courts) that have significantly altered the mission and governance of higher education. It is concluded that, on balance, higher education's partnership with governments on both state and national levels has generated far more benefits than it has administrative burdens. However, because external influences on academic governance should not be allowed to overwhelm internal governance structures, colleges are urged to strengthen self-regulation capacity, to take leadership roles, and to revitalize their historic governance tradition. The survey questionnaire is included, together with a list of participating institutions and agencies. (SW)",

Topics of discussion include: the dominance of the Ph.D. as the credential for college teachers; the effects of graduate education on undergraduate teaching; the shrinking of the collegiate student body and its implications for the need for scholars in the future; the role of general education in the preparation of scholars; the need for perspectives on foreign cultures in the scholar's training; distinctions  between traditional graduate divisions and professional schools; tensions between colleges (within and separate from universities) and the graduate divisions of universities; moral and ethical concerns of those engaged in research; and the degree to which concern for equality of opportunity in education might change the quality of scholarship.

Included is Vermont's unified position concerning the relative merits of House and Senate versions of the Higher Education Act. In Vermont, a special committee composed of representatives from all sectors of higher education monitored the Reauthorization Act. It is noted that there has been greater reliance on loan programs and that the value of Pell grants has dropped by 26% in the last 5 years, because of the effects of the constant dollar. Attention is directed to the consequences of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act and current budget proposals. It is argued that the Reagan Administration's student aid proposals would eliminate or reduce awards for over 3 million  students, whose only alternative source of assistance would be loans carrying a significantly higher burden of debt. Loan availability would be drastically curtailed, however, if the proposed Guaranteed Student Loan changes cause lenders to pull out and collapse the program. Twelve categorical support programs would be eliminated by recisions in the current fiscal year (FY) 1986 budget, and no funds would be requested for them in FY 1987. Suggestions are offered concerning eligibility for Pell grants and program administration. (SW)",

Study two, which was conducted at a different university, also offered extra credit for participating and elicited students' reasons for volunteering and information on their grade point average and expected grade in introductory psychology. Students who participated did not appear to differ in demographic variables from nonparticipants, but there were differences in grades attained by participants and nonparticipants. Volunteers in the extra credit incentive  system appeared to be mostly the top students and students who are motivated by grades that are perceived as being low. More students who did not need the credit to attain a high grade participated in research anyway. Since students with high motivation to achieve may participate in research more than students with low achievement motivation, the generalizability of research findings may be limited. It is noted that extra credit for research participation may also be a source of grade inflation. (SW)",

After briefly describing the college and its goals, a literature review addresses the need for special services for specific student groups. Bowie State College has historically served low-income, black, first-generation college students and the disabled. The Bowie State College's Special Services for Disadvantaged Students Project has served students who have special needs generated by poverty, lack of adequate role models, poor academic skills, inadequate social and personal skills, learning disabilities, and physical disabilities. Data are provided on: student attrition by entering class,  1975-1984, including the graduation rate for Special Services participants; headcount enrollment, 1975-1985; undergraduate and graduate student enrollment by race; student enrollment by age; residency of full-time and part-time undergraduates; credit hours of enrollment by discipline for 1985-1986; degrees awarded during 1964-1985; the number of dependent and independent undergraduates by income range; and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores (for Bowie, the state average, and the national average).

Four phases of surgical psychomotor skills training are identified, using an example from a dental preclinical training curriculum: (1) dental students are acquainted with the postural and positional parameters of balanced psychomotor performances; (2) students learn the basic psychomotor skills in a setting that stimulates an optimal operational setting regarding spatial dimensions, tissues, and perceptual features (e.g., sight, sound, smell); (3) students apply the basic skills in an optimal clinical setting that is consistent with their preclinical setting; and (4) students apply their knowledge of postural and positional parameters (performance logic) to nonideal operational settings so they can  learn to adapt equipment to their needs as human operators. The example from dental training is the surgical cutting of dental hard tissues with a high speed aid turbine handpiece. The following steps are involved: specifying parameters in numerical terms for both task end product and process; confirming parameters plus performance practice, evaluating the targeted tooth, cutting simulated tissues in the simulation setting, evaluating the end product, and correlating process and product. Worksheets and diagrmas that illustrate these steps are included. (SW)",

Emphasis is placed upon the structural and cultural differences in the educational systems of these countries. In addition to college admission requirements for each country, attention is directed to high school graduation requirements in mathematics, science, and foreign languages. Included are case studies of high school exit examinations. An important difference between the United States and the other four countries is the greater accessibility of secondary schools and colleges in the United States. In contrast to the United States, the other four industrialized countries view  education as having the function of awakening the student's sense of participation in, and relationship to, a national community and national tradition. The Soviet Union, France, and Japan have highly centralized educational systems in which important decisions are made at the national level. Only West Germany has a mixed regional and state central system. In the other four countries, access to higher education is controlled by national examinations that are based on national academic standards. Numerous tables and a four-page bibliography conclude the document. (SW)",

Increased public concern about the purposes and standards of higher education has followed the publication of four major publications about higher education in the United States. Changing demographics are projected for 1983-1993, including fewer 18- to 22-year-olds, decreased full-time and increased part-time enrollments, and a decrease in senior instructional staff. It is suggested that colleges will react to public concern and changing demographics in the following ways: evaluation of the mission of higher education, increased competition for students, an emphasis on student competencies, and increased awareness of competing education systems. These general trends will affect students, administrators, and faculty.  Student trends concerning minority access, student debt, foreign students, and part-time students are addressed, along with management trends concerning planning, financing, marketing, student retention, and institutional leadership. Teacher and curriculum trends concern: minority and women employment, collective bargaining, tenure and the graying professoriate, migrant faculty, faculty workload, occupational versus liberal arts/general education, educational delivery systems, high technology, and response to corporate training/degree programs.

Six learning styles were identified through use of the Grasha-Riechmann Student Learning Styles Scales: avoidant, collaborative, dependent, competitive, independent, and participant. Life cycle stages were based on Levinson's theory of the adult life cycle: entering the adult world (ages 22 to 28), age 30 transition (ages 28 to 33), settling down (ages 33 to 40), midlife transition (ages 40 to 45), and entering middle adulthood (ages 45-50). The sample consisted of 183 male and 322 female graduate students at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. Students were enrolled in 500 and 600 level classes and were between the ages of 22 and 50. The findings indicated that the  graduate students used different learning styles. While no significant difference in learning styles was found for men and women, men were more avoidant and females were more participatory. No significant difference in learning style between the life cycle stages occurred; however, individuals tended to be more independent the greater their life cycle stages. In addition, individuals tended to be less avoidant and more participatory the greater their life cycle stage. Implications of the findings for graduate-level education are considered. (SW)",

He believes that there is a gap between the rhetoric and reality of American higher education. While noting the vast facilities and resources at Harvard and other institutions, Secretary Bennett emphasizes the importance of a good general education, including the benefits of a real core curriculum (i.e., a set of fundamental courses, ordered,  purposive, and coherent). He argues that too often colleges and universities, especially the most prestitious institutions, fail in the discharge of their educational responsibilities. Of interest is a survey of undergraduates that found two-fifths of respondents did not feel any professor took &quot;special personal interest&quot; in their academic progress, and many desired better guidance. Secretary Bennett also discusses the financial condition of higher education and the idea of the university as a place for free exchange of ideas. (SW)",

Data were obtained from the Postsecondary School Transcripts Study, a supplement to the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. The sample consisted of 4,440 graduates who received the bachelor's degree by December 1984. Less than half the students who earned a bachelor's degree entered college by the fall after high school graduation and completed their degree within 4 years. Fifty-one percent took more than 4 years from high school graduation to complete their degree. Three-fourths earned their degree within 5 years after high school graduation, and 24% took 6, 7, or more years. The effects of the  following characteristics on degree completion were assessed: aptitude test composite score; high school curriculum (academic, general, vocational); socioeconomic status; and region of high school (Northeast, North Central, South, West). The percentage of degree recipients who completed a degree within 4 years was also calculated for selected majors (social sciences, mathematics and sciences, education, humanities, business and marketing, and engineering).

Because educational software is a relatively new phenomenon in education itself, it is not easy to determine in advance the actual desires of the potential user; current production strategies are based on either an individual approach, a team approach, or a project approach. None of the educational sectors has reached the stage at which it would be profitable to publish the materials developed. Guidance tools, project management and system development methodologies, and  the organization of education into macro, meso and micro levels have been developed to support software development. Working out problems has led to splitting the development process into four distinct phases: (1) describing the purpose of the program; (2) describing the functional aspects of different subsystems; (3) determining detailed pedagogical design; and (4) designing the system by which the encoding takes place. In order to stimulate the introduction of computers in education, the Dutch government has established the 5-year &quot;Informatics Stimulation Plan&quot;; three development centers, each one specifically aimed at a particular sector of education; 28 regional centers for education and information technology; and a clearinghouse for educational software. The need for teacher  training programs to include courses illustrating the use of computers as educational aids is noted. (DJR)",

Past experiences, current experiments, and future possibilities for improving the capacity of television to serve as a tool for development are outlined and examples are provided. Where television failed and why it is considered a disappointment as an educational tool in Africa is also discussed, but the major focus of the report is on how television can get back on track and what the chances are for making changes. Ways to  enhance television's message reception such as group viewing, the use of government television sets powered by solar energy, and complementing television broadcasts with field animation and other media are covered in Section 1. Section 2 describes three possibilitiess for improving television's capacity to educate, including the use of drama to present socially-relevant messages, decentralized and narrowcast use of video, and the importance of formative surveying, pretesting, and feedback. Section 3, which considers several areas in which television can potentially help, focuses on educating women in such a way as to inspire their participation in the development process, agriculture, and health care education. The country of Cameroon is examined as a microcosm of an African television  service. Discussions of cost-effectiveness and political considerations involved in the &quot;reinvention&quot; of television as part of Africa's broadcasting development conclude the report. Appended are a series of black and white photographs illustrating various aspects of television development in Africa and accompanied by narrative explanations. (Author/DJR)",

        "description":"This brief review of how computers are currently being used and studied in the schools stresses ways in which computers will be used to enhance learning and development, and the need for research on computer learning to consider the multi-functional uses of computers in various contexts, instead of seeing it as a medium with a single effect on learning. A mediational approach based on research with first grade children learning Logo is suggested, and it is argued that any research on computer usage needs to employ a multi-layered approach accounting for: (1) value questions concerning learning content; (2) the social context in which computers are placed; and (3) theoretical principles explaining the process of learning with computers. The choice of Logo for research on learning  and development and the structuring of Logo instruction to take into account both the social context of learning and theoretical principles are explained, and the learning environment created through Logo is described in the context of Vygotsky's work and its relationship to the field of metacognition. It is concluded that the value of Logo lies in its propensity to give children a feeling of success; however, it is felt that the implementation of a full-blown computer curriculum for Logo complete with workbooks and how-to instruction would be premature, and that researchers need to use both naturalistic and experimental methods to sort out effects of learning on different types of learners in different contexts.

Case studies from three diverse cultural, geographic, and academic settings are presented which provide an in-depth look at the problems and solutions involved in the integration of this course into their curriculums. The course consists of 14 units, each focusing on a principle that underlies today's technology. The 14 units are intended  to be covered over 2 years; the first 9 sequentially, and the second 5 at the teacher's discretion. Each unit consists of a student manual, a teacher's guide, hands-on laboratories, and video programs. Each of the studies tells about the setting of the school, how the course was implemented and taught, and what the students were like.

Data from this survey were used to examine the incentive value of a variety of administrative computer policies for encouraging more widespread participation by teachers in inservice training and use of microcomputers as a tool for instruction in subject matter classes. Such policies include technical support, rewards and incentives for teachers, and the involvement of teaching staff in decisions about the implementation of microcomputer-based instruction. The report presents the conceptual framework for the study; reviews the literature on improving participation in inservice training and encouraging educational innovations; describes  the survey and presents the survey results; and discusses the implications of the findings for educational research and policy.

Each of the assignments begins with a lesson that teaches the specific skills to be used in the reading/writing assignment: (1) distinguishing fact from opinion; (2) determining the author's point of view and how it affects what she/he says; (3) detecting fallacies; (4) comparing and contrasting articles that take different positions on a single issue; and (5) the skill of analyzing and evaluating a given article. In the process of teaching these skills, students are introduced to the research and writing  conventions of the political science discipline. All of the assignments are written up, bound, and sold in the bookstore as a required text, which reduces to a minimum the class time required for teaching these skills. Although students tend to grumble about the amount of work, they admit that they find the exercises profitable. (DJR)",

The clinical contract is an effective learning strategy in aiding students to become more self-directed and confident. In using a contract, the teacher becomes a facilitator focusing on what the student needs to learn rather than on what is to be taught. The teacher identifies basic competencies in knowledge and skills and then works with the student to identify learning strategies and criteria for evaluation; the end result is a binding contract for both parties. Students actively share the responsibility for planning and carrying out a learning experience,  and perceive their success or lack of it to be determined by their ability to accomplish objectives. The contract is composed of three parts--the competency, the learning strategies, and the evaluation criteria--and is developed within a few class days. The student negotiates with the teacher for an A, B, or C grade with C being the minimum criteria for a particular competency. During mid-semester the student may renegotiate for a grade or develop alternate learning strategies. At the end of the semester the student presents evidence of attainment to the faculty facilitator. (DJR)",

The description of the program in the second section includes the rationale for using the microcomputers and its  integration into learning activities in the classroom and the laboratory, the four steps covered by the computer simulations, and the procedures for a self-assessment test. The third section discusses three factors involved in the implementation process: classroom setting, the student and self-paced progress, and the role of the teacher in the classroom.

The structures embedded in the texts are visualized in three-dimensional cubic spaces, and the results are discussed with respect to their dimensionality, as well as to the phase spaces of the cognitive processes. Results indicate that the Swedish mechanics seem to subordinate themselves to the company and are unconcerned about obtaining information of a technical nature. The American workers, however, feel that their worth is insufficiently recognized and express a need for  instruction to be provided by the company to facilitate their understanding of technical information. It is concluded that this divergence in information needs between the American and Swedish mechanics ought to have considerable effects on the information policy of the industry. (KM)",

Conclusions indicate that the time needed to conduct a simple availability analysis is  minimal; the sampling technique is a good management tool for monitoring library performance in the areas of circulation dysfunction and library housekeeping dysfunction; adjusted data sorted by last circulation date would provide the best approximation of actual availability; and results of data gathered during periods of low use and high use differ considerably.

First, an introductory chapter looks at reasons for developing a gerontological curricula, potential audiences for such a program (i.e., health care providers, other caregivers, older adults, and career track students), and a rationale and process for setting up a gerontological curriculum. The next chapter identifies gerontology's core of knowledge; considers the unifying themes for the curriculum; describes a three-tiered curriculum for degree-seeking students, professionals and paraprofessionals, and informal caregivers; and discusses the synergy of the curricula. Next, the guide considers the groups that should be involved in a  network for program development, including the on-campus gerontology team consisting of college administrators, faculty, and key members of the community; gerontological consultants with expertise in theory, research, and applications; and other community colleges. The next chapter suggests that a conference be held to launch the network, and recommends ways of maintaining the networks. The final chapter looks at issues related to funding and resources, and responds to some commonly asked questions. Following a bibliography, appendices provide lists of members of the National Association of State Units on Aging; ideas for short workshops, non-credit courses, or other educational activities for Older Adult Learning Centers; courses about or for the aging offered by members of the Western  Kansas Community Services Consortium (WKCSC); Rural AGE Teams and Participants; institutions with educational programs in gerontology nationwide; conference tips and agendas; foundations which fund gerontological projects; and university participants in pilot projects.

After presenting background information on efforts to improve transfer and articulation in California, the report summarizes the 1985 plan and progress made in implementing each of its components. The following activities are highlighted: (1) the publication of the first &quot;California Handbook of Articulation Policies and Procedures&quot;; (2) the 1985 Articulation Conference of California, which served as a forum to identify and highlight successful articulation projects; (3) intersegmental efforts to promote faculty communication statewide; (4) participation of 59 colleges in the California Articulation  Number System, a statewide cross reference number system designed to assist students in determining which community college courses can be taken to fulfill certain specific course requirements at the four-year institutions; (5) the conduct of a survey of community colleges to determine ways of making University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) performance reports more useful; and (6) the strengthening and expansion of the functions of the Articulation Council of California. Next, additional statewide efforts undertaken to promote transfer and articulation are described briefly and an action plan for 1986-87 is presented. (EJV)",

Introductory material explains the goals and objectives of the symposium and identifies the five major recurrent themes raised throughout the small and full group discussions; i.e., institutional racism, open access, intersegmental articulation, community partnership, and advisory boards. Next, five recommendation areas are discussed: (1) institutional commitment (i.e., commitment to improving minority student recruitment and retention by colleges, districts and the system); (2) partnerships between the different educational systems aimed at increasing the transfer  rates of minority students; (3) uniform standards forming a clear set of expectations for all students in areas such as course prerequisites, basic skills, academic progress, and probation/dismissal standards; (4) outreach efforts designed to improve the public's perception of community colleges as viable institutions of higher education which can well serve the needs of ethnic and language minorities; and (5) activities to emphasize, redirect, and increase both educational and support services for students to ensure the retention of minority students. The bulk of the report consists of the action plan which details specific recommendations under each of these five areas.

Following introductory remarks on the work of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges' Urban Community Colleges Commission which culminated in the preparation of the monograph, the mission of the urban community college is examined, underscoring its primary roles as educational institution and community resource and facilitator. A discussion of the educational and social roles of urban community colleges  is followed by a call for research into fundamental questions about the impact of the urban community college on its environment. The next section considers the importance of developing operational definitions of excellence and access in order to measure institutional effectiveness in these areas. Next, the monograph explores issues related to articulation and program linkages, the associate degree as the touchstone of educational excellence, and the influence of finance on the community college mission. The next sections consider the community college's role in economic and human resources development, personnel issues for urban institutions, questions related to organizational management and development, and curricular needs for currency and continuity. Finally, recommendations for  further research and investigation are presented. (LAL)",

The first portion of the report provides data showing 5-year (fall 1981 through fall 1985) statewide trends in actual opening fall credit enrollments. Figures and tables focus on statewide enrollment by student status (i.e., first-time-in-college, returning, or transfer students); by full-/part-time status; by class (i.e., freshman, sophomore, or unclassified); by program (i.e., advanced and professional, vocational, and other); by race; and by sex. Next, tables provide fall 1985 data by campus. Highlighted findings indicate the following: (1) fall enrollments increased in 1985 for the first  time since 1983; (2) for the 5 years beginning with 1981, there was an overall decline of 958 students or 0.4%; (3) returning students represented the largest group of community college students, accounting for 67.3% of the total in 1985; (4) first-time-in-college students showed an 11.9% decline since 1981; (5) the number of full-time students decreased by 5.2% over the 5-year period, while the number of part-time students increased by the same percent; and (6) an analysis of enrollments by race and sex showed that there were slight decreases among non-resident aliens and whites, while other ethnic groups showed annual increases or remained fairly constant; and that female students continued to comprise the larger percentage of total students.

Focusing on more than transfer of course credits, these efforts have involved multidimensional programs of cooperation with high schools and four-year institutions as well as programs which identify and assist potential transfer students. Some community colleges are taking direct or indirect steps to hone the skills of students who are still in high school (e.g., specifying and disseminating information on the academic competencies expected of college students, sponsoring programs to improve the test-taking or college survival skills of high school students, and offering classes to improve the reading, writing, and thinking skills of low-achieving  students). Transfer is also promoted through articulation agreements with four-year colleges specifying the transferability of competencies as well as credits and formal and informal activities designed to promote dialogue among faculty members. Other manifestations of the movement to improve transfer rates are the development of assessment and tracking systems, which provide ongoing feedback on student progress toward graduation and transfer; and special support programs designed to promote the educational mobility of minority and disadvantaged students at urban community colleges. Efforts to improve transfer depend largely on the information systems that serve both college personnel and students. These efforts to strengthen the transfer function represent an attempt to place the  community college more securely in the educational mainstream of student flow from high school through the baccalaureate.

Obstacles to academic persistence include external factors such as insufficient funds, work demands, social demands, family obligations, housing or transportation problems; and internal problems such as procrastination, fear of failure, inability to ask for help, loneliness, self-doubt, value conflicts, and career indecision. To deal with these factors, college retention efforts should focus on areas such as academic stimulation and assistance, personal future building, and out-of-class faculty interaction. Additional retention activities, such as mandatory testing and placement, orientation programs, peer instruction, and integrated  support services, have also been identified as helpful. Research and experience have indicated that intervention strategies that focus on specific needs of targeted groups of at-risk students, including low-income students, the academically underprepared, students with unclear academic and career goals, and reentry students, may increase retention. Current research indicates that such retention programs, comprising assessment and placement, orientation, counseling, academic advising, developmental education, and ancillary support services, can and do enhance students' chances of success.

Two keynote addresses by Brian Sutton-Smith are presented along with five sectional presentations by other speakers. The first keynote address, concerning the nature of children's stories: (1) argues that adults use stories to indoctrinate children, and not to encourage children to express themselves; (2) provides examples of stories invented by children; (3) points out characteristics of children's stories; and (4) differentiates four levels of children's story construction. The second keynote address examines some currently available, widely contrasting views of play and games. Play is discussed in terms of its idealization as freedom, as creativity and imagination, as mastery,  and as collaboration. Games are discussed in terms of the idealization and malediction of games, games as irrational, as deceptive, and as physical contest. Relevant applications of each of the above discussions to the play of early childhood are considered. Sectional presentations concern stages of artistic development during early childhood (James H. Brutger), holistic wellness for teachers (Frank Guldbrandsen), health education for preschoolers (Georgia L. Keeney), ways adults can help abused children (Kay Stevens), and ways of strengthening stepfamilies (Janine A. Watts). (RH)",

The activities are intended to teach older children that (1) each person is unique and may learn in ways that are different from others of the same age; (2) very simple experiences, which may be \"old hat\" to 9- to 11-year-olds, can be exciting and challenging for 3- to 6-year-olds; (3) play activities provide experiences that are necessary and important in the growth and development of healthy human beings; and (4) completing a particular activity or learning to do an activity exactly as described should  always be less important than helping children have fun together. Suggested activities allow participants to enjoy each other, explore and express feelings, develop healthy bodies, talk and listen, and learn about their world. (RH)",

The present paper briefly reviews the arguments of the first, and presents various options that state government officials should consider in developing state policies and programs for young children. Advantages and disadvantages of each option are included in discussions of (1) selecting a population and identifying children in that population who need services, (2) how many daily  program hours are needed to meet child care needs, (3) how much money to invest, and (4) which agencies to consider as potential recipients of funds. Two appendices review current government funding for early childhood programs and list sources of information concerning early childhood program policies. (RH)",

All mothers were ambulatory, responsible for &quot;rooming-in&quot; care, and had no histories of psychiatric or chronic physical illness. Multiple measures were employed to gather data during the infant's first week of life and again 7 weeks later.

        "description":"Papert (1980) contended that the value of the Logo computer program lies in its ability to allow children to take control of their own learning processes and to acquire skills and concepts independently of a stifling curriculum generated by adults. It is argued here that Papert's ideas are preserved when teachers' modelling of cognitive strategies helps mediate children's internalization of abstract concepts and provides them with the knowledge of strategies necessary for independently thinking through Logo problem solving tasks. This paper examines how the recorded discourse structure of some Logo lessons illustrates a teacher's use of mediated strategies to facilitate the shift in children's development from regulation by others to self-regulation of cognitive processes. A  discourse analysis of Logo lessons given to two pairs of 5-year-old children revealed that elicitations of both teacher and child decreased over time as the children gained greater mastery; teacher directives decreased as peer collaboration increased; responses of children to metacognitive prompts remained stable; and children's talk became increasingly task-oriented. It is concluded that for children to learn Logo successfully, careful structuring of the teaching process may be required. (Author/RH)",

In particular, findings indicated that representations of gender emerge as one of the principal means through which the developing child is able to assimilate features of economic life. The development of economic concepts may be construed as a process of social transmission in which complex interactions occur between the child's development and adults' social representations of economic life.

The research examined school and classroom environment, teacher theory, teacher practice, and student art activities and learning. Results showed that only the BIA school considered the aesthetic/art heritage and ethnic values of its students. Factors determining whether students' heritage/values were considered were teacher's ethnic background, university  courses in preparation for teaching art, and exposure to cultural values, art forms, and history of Indian ethnic groups. The study recommends that to utilize art as a tool to dissolve bigotry between Indians and whites in Wisconsin, more Indian art teachers should be hired by Indian communities; white teachers' education should include Indian values systems, traditions, and art forms; Indian artists should be utilized in schools; Indian students should be encouraged to express their culture through their art production; and teachers should design projects to allow for such expression.

Education has a desirable controlling influence over development of the rural individual, family, community, and society, leading to reduced poverty, income equity, and controlled unemployment. The failure of trickle-down development and recognition of the importance of rural areas and rural people to the economic emancipation of developing countries has given education a key role in rural systems of supply, production, marketing, personnel maintenance, education, health care, and governance. Functions of education include imparting social change, improving individual social position and standard of living, activating participation in rural and cultural development,  increasing critical abilities of rural people to diagnose their needs, assert their rights, and take greater control of decisions affecting their lives, providing trained manpower in rural areas, linking rural and urban sectors, providing employment and income opportunities, increasing labor force productivity, and developing leadership. Education oriented to urban rather than rural needs may do more harm than good by accelerating rural to urban migration, generating youth unemployment, and leaving students ill-equipped to succeed in a rural environment. Education contributing to rural development must be locally controlled, practical, applied, problem-posing, and focused on functional specialization. (LFL)",

Comparison of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics included racial and ethnic distribution, industrial bases, community life, leisure activities, religious life, attitudes about school, educational training, and community priorities. Comparison of school systems included district histories, experiences with reorganization, school board composition, administration, teachers, unions, curriculum offerings, student achievement, and student aspirations. The two communities were remarkably alike for all variables considered  except that important differences existed in the academic offerings and educational service delivery of their school systems. While Applegate offered the type of limited educational program often associated with rural schools, Bakerville exhibited an academic vitality suggesting that the problems faced by rural schools are surmountable. The role played by the Bakerville superintendent appeared critical in that district's success and paralleled the role of principal for effective inner-city schools as described by Rosenholtz (1985). The processes underlying effective schools, as enumerated by Rosenholtz, existed in the Bakerville School District and included improved student performance as a clear objective and involvement of the faculty in realizing that objective.

Witnesses recommend language be included in the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act to fund Title VI at a level of $12.5 million for fiscal year 1987; $17.5 million for fiscal year 1988; and $20 million for fiscal year 1989. Experts report on analysis of computer data from a needs assessment of 813 older Indians in the United States and trends of a survey focusing on decreasing funding levels of Title VI grantees and how this impacts the targeting of service to older Indians who are already unserved and  underserved. Recommendations to improve the Title VI program at project, tribal, and national levels include incorporating special diets into nutrition services because of high incidence of diabetes and hypertension among Indian elderly, continuing to provide unrestricted home delivered meals, including at least one Indian professional on the Office of State and Tribal Programs staff, and formulating a national policy on Indian aging. Appendices include Title VI history of funding reports from 22 tribes. (NEC)",

        "description":"A hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary concerning S. 1818, a bill to prevent sexual molestation of children in Indian country, provides a forum for witnesses and describes a child advocacy program. Three witnesses from Fort Peck Reservation, Montana, describe incidence and characteristics of sexual abuse on the reservation and discuss legal problems encountered in bringing abusers to court. They offer suggestions about judicial reform, revision of restrictive federal and tribal laws, and establishment of child advocacy programs. Testimony includes constitution and bylaws of one such program on the reservation--Voices for Children. A United States Department of Justice witness clarifies the relationship of the proposed bill to existing legislation and  emphasizes that the bill would ensure equality of punishment for sexual abuse offenses whether defendants and victims are Indian or non-Indian. Other witnesses include the Executive Director of the National Congress of American Indians who estimates the number of Indian children covered by the legislation to be 375,000, and the Director of the American Indian Law Center, Inc., of Albuquerque, New Mexico, who details problems of investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse in Indian country and urges federal action to compensate for limitations of tribal courts.

Seventeen participants completed the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI) by Spielberger et al. (1980) and donated 30 ml of blood for Beta-endorphin analysis two days prior to the MCAT and also three days after the test. Student grade point average (GPA) and number of science courses were other variables analyzed. Results indicated that TAI were more elevated pre-MCAT and Beta-endorphin was higher after the examination. Total TAI was significantly inversely related to GPA and there were positive correlations between GPA and MCAT scores. Regression results indicated that  select items from TAI, GPA, and Beta-endorphin could be used to predict performance on particular MCAT subsets and that MCAT scores were influenced by test anxiety. Appendices include copies of the TAI, procedures used in processing blood samples for Beta-endorphin, and complete correlation matrices. A 14-page bibliography is included. (ML)",

The evidence indicates that the textbook is the most widely used instructional material, and few teachers appear to use any other materials more than five times a year. Research findings on the value of the use of manipulative materials seems clear: they have a high probability of increasing achievement, and appear to be essential in providing a firm foundation for developing mathematical ideas. While textbooks and tests shape the curriculum, studies indicate that the match of topics between the two cannot be taken for granted. While most children at all grade levels have access to or own calculators, few teachers actually use them in the mathematics classroom. Nevertheless, achievement  scores are as high or higher when calculators are used for mathematics instruction as when they are not used. The usefulness of computers is accepted, but the task of integrating them into the curriculum has just started. Each of the findings is discussed, with illustrative references cited. (MNS)",

        "description":"In an effort to improve students' interests in science and science courses, a study was conducted in Israel to evaluate students' attitudes towards science relative to two chemistry curricula. These curricula were Chemistry for High Schools (CFH), and Chemistry--A Challenge (CAC). The CFH program was mainly designed for science-oriented students and is based on inquiry techniques, concept formation and laboratory investigation. The CAC was developed in an attempt to meet the needs of a population of students that are more heterogeneous, both in their cognitive ability and their scientific interest. Major findings of the study indicated that: (1) CAC students' tendency to choose science as a future career was significantly higher than that of CFH students; (2) CAC students  appreciated scientists in general and chemists in particular more than CFH students; (3) chemistry was considered significantly more important to CAC students than to CFH students; and (4) CAC students regarded chemistry as a school subject to be more interesting, more important, and less difficult than CFH students. It was concluded that a curriculum geared to the needs and interests of students can help in developing positive attitudes toward science. (TW)",

Mathematics and social studies were selected as the subject areas because of observed differences in classroom practices. Six questions guided the analyses, concerning types of grouping arrangements, instructional formats, student behaviors, student cognitive processes, types of materials, and instructional recommendations. Five fifth-grade teacher's guides in mathematics and five in social studies were examined. Within each guide, two portions of the commentary section were analyzed, each representing an instructional sequence of approximately two weeks' duration. The activities in each  portion of the lesson commentaries were identified and coded. A total of 506 mathematics activities and 399 social studies activities were found. Ninety-four percent of these were entire-class activities. Although traditional instruction patterns were common in the activities suggested in the guides of both subjects, differences did occur both between and within subject areas. An active student role seemed to be encouraged more in social studies than in mathematics and more in some social studies series than in others. (MNS)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether an instructional unit on inventing affected the inventive abilities of fifth and sixth graders and investigate the possible effects of the unit on students' creativity scores and attitudes towards science. Concomitantly, this study attempted to determine whether relationships existed between students' inventive abilities and the following: achievement, intelligence, creativity, and creative interests. One-hundred-seven fifth and sixth graders in three elementary schools were randomly assigned by school to experimental and control groups. Analysis of the data revealed a number of significant interactions. For the measure of inventing, instruction by sex and school by grade were significant interactions. Achievement as a covariate  was also found to be significant. The interaction, school by grade by sex, was significant for creativity. There were no significant correlations between inventing, creativity, and attitude towards science, as measured by this study, although changes in creativity scores and attitudes towards science scores occurred. The results of this study suggest that instruction does increase inventiveness for some students. (Author/TW)",

The purposes of this report are to provide information on the effectiveness of the mathematics program in the high school, including the identification of deficiency areas and recommendations for improving instruction, and to provide a model for subsequent district and school analyses. How well the test measures program efforts and how well students are performing are each explored. Overall, tenth grade students in Hawaii performed slightly better than the national norm population, with 79 percent scoring in the average and above average ranges. Approximately 44 percent of the items measure expectations which may require performance at a level below  grade 9. The test is moderately effective in assessing the attainment of some objectives, but not all, in the state mathematics program. Subtest analyses of the data indicate 20 items on which students scored lower than national norms.

Nominations for effective programs were solicited from 83 dioceses, and 258 nominations were received. Three methodologies were used to examine these programs: selected site visits; a staff survey at each site; and a survey of a random sample of students at each site. One hundred and forty-six parishes cooperated in the surveys for a return rate of 57 percent. The body of the report is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 discusses administrative and program factors. Chapter 2 examines student religious  behavior, beliefs, values, and influences. Chapter 3 presents student views on their catechists and programs. Chapter 4 describes parish religious education input factors that are associated with student outcomes and chapter 5 includes a summary and examines some implications. The report concludes with a listing of 33 major findings compiled from chapters 1 through 4 and appendix A, which discusses the observations of the site visitors. Five other appendices are provided. Appendices B through D include the staff survey, the student survey, and methodological notes. Appendix E contains a list of project consultants and appendix F presents a list of participating parishes. (RSL)",

        "description":"The paper details a study supporting the hypothesis that people's opinions about nuclear arms control are influenced by their logically relevant beliefs about nuclear weapons, nuclear war, and the Soviet Union. The hypothesis should not be construed to imply that these beliefs are the only influences or the most powerful influences on arms control opinions for most citizens today. Rather, if most citizens are ambivalent and uncertain about arms control, and are probably also uninformed and uninvolved regarding this issue, their opinions may be strongly influenced by additional variables. Subjects were students (N=188) at the California Polytechnic State University who completed the Nuclear Weapons Policies questionnaire near the beginning of the summer quarter and again near the  end of the quarter. (Seventy-two students withdrew or were absent for the second testing.) Three beliefs were shown to relate to opinion about arms control: (1) &quot;Superiority is important&quot;; (2) &quot;Nuclear war is unlikely if the arms race continues&quot;; and (3) &quot;The Soviets are insincere and untrustworthy about arms control.&quot; These beliefs appear to function as psychological barriers to supporting arms control. An evaluation of the effects of three educational interventions provided some support for the hypothesis that logically relevant information and arguments may influence people to become more favorable toward arms control proposals. Tables showing attitude scales of the Nuclear Weapons Policies questionnaire, correlations between beliefs and arms control opinion, psychological barriers to  arms control, and pre and post treatment means scores and comparisons, and an appendix outlining the psychology of the nuclear arms race conclude the document.

The application of economic principles calls into question some assumptions that appear to be common among members of the global education movement. That these assumptions might be erroneous raises questions about the instructional strategies and materials used in some social studies classes. Explored in this paper are three assumptions that are often made by global educators and that are erroneous. First, consideration is given to the apparent emphasis on what is referred to as the \"zero-sum\" assumption. Second, the implicit assumption of the weakness of incentives is examined. Finally, the paper challenges  the assumptions leading to the persistent use of trend lines as a device for forecasting the future. (BZ)",

        "description":"Imagination is central to our ability to understand reality. Parents and teachers should foster creative processes which facilitate the development of imagination in children. Expensive equipment or artistic expertise is not necessary to help children develop their imaginations. Instead, it is more important for teachers to allow children the time to indulge in the creative process. Suggestions for helping create an effective art environment are given. First, allow children to help plan sessions. A chance to assist in structuring the environment gives them a valuable sense of control over what they are doing and makes the creative process more meaningful. Second, set up a non-competitive atmosphere which values self-expression and description. Try to make art meaningful by  supporting each child's individual style. Third, focus on the affective aspects of creativity. Curiosity, openness to experience, self-confidence, and use of imagination are primary affective aspects of the creative process. Fourth, observe children with a research frame of mind. A heightened sense of awareness allows for observation of connections, patterns, and insights which help teachers understand children. Fourteen references of books which promote creativity are included. (SY)",

        "description":"United States educational history is full of uncertain reform attempts beginning with colonial New England's school reform goal of salvation in this world as a preparation for eternal life in the next. A more practical type of education characterized the Early National Period. Monitorial schools and communal schools, as in New Harmony, Indiana, preceded the common school movement, the major nineteenth century school reform. Led by Horace Mann in Massachusetts, Henry Barnard in Connecticut and Rhode Island, and similar leaders in other states, the common school was open to all, state tax supported, and in time, compulsory. The reform was spread by Jacksonian democrats, newspapers and educational journals, and enlightened speakers on the American lyceum circuit in town halls across  the nation. Changing conditions, 1893-1918, transformed the high school from an elite to a plebeian, multipurpose, comprehensive institution. The child-centered progressive education movement, 1890s-1930s, also had a leveling effect. Reformed to meet the multiple needs of mass enrollments, the high school inevitably lowered its academic standards for the average and below average. In times of national crisis many so-called school reforms appeared briefly. Today hard choices and creative solutions potentially may confer upon teachers the authority, autonomy, responsibility, and respect that they deserve. (BZ)",

        "description":"A report of research conducted in Tianjin, People's Republic of China (September 1981-January 1982) describes and analyses changes in family structure, marriage, post-marital residence, and fertility in a neighborhood of factory workers over a 50-year period. Social and economic changes such as delayed marriage, increased access to education, and the entrance of women into the labor force were accompanied by a decline in fertility. But modernization theory and demographic transition do not anticipate the fertility transformations which actually occurred. Changes indicate fertility was at least as responsive to political shifts as modernization. The paper suggests it may be more useful to begin with the demographic pattern, and use it to signal potentially important economic,  political, or social causes, than to begin with specific social causes. Twelve figures and 18 tables are included and an 8-page reference list is appended. (APG)",

This rather diverse family conducts research described by turns as qualitative, participant observational, case study, symbolic interactionist, phenomenological, constructivist, and interpretive. The focus of the ethnographer's inquiry is on the mundane, everyday practices of people. Social studies and ethnographic research would seem to go together naturally. What may be surprising is that social studies educators appear to be less willing than others in education to use field research techniques. In 1973, Shaver and Larkins argued that most of the research in social studies was being conducted by graduate students. There may be several reasons for the paucity of ethnographic studies of  social studies classes or social studies teaching. Among these reasons are: (1) There is a disconcerting narrowness of scope in ethnographic design. (2) The research methodologies require a difficult, time-consuming set of procedures which, if not adhered to, lead to research of questionable value, and leave the researcher time for very little else. (3) Although classroom ethnographies provide rich descriptions, they present only a thin slice of school culture. (4) Host schools are entitled to protection, but pseudonyms and disguises cannot mask the school and those who earn a livelihood there from anyone who knew about the enterprise. (BZ)",

Answers were sought to two questions: (1) what linkages exist between the development of teacher perspectives and the experiences provided by university teacher education?; and (2) what role does the individual play in the construction of a teacher perspective? Among the findings were support for the hypothesis that teacher socialization is a dialectical process involving three interacting sets of variables (personal, institutional, and the interaction between the two); that course work is less useful than field experience; that a high value is placed upon the apprenticeship of observation; and that teacher educators should provide opportunities  for study and application of action research methods. Among the several recommendations arising from the study are that the active role of the individual in mediating the curriculum of teaching can no longer be ignored and that providing preservice teachers with the initial tools for professional growth and a support network for continued growth are important steps toward the goal of excellence in the schools.

The respective curricula and model degree programs indicate that at Deakin in level 1 courses there is considerable emphasis on the use of sources, textual and documentary analysis, methodology, and historiography. In both universities the commitment to inter-disciplinary approaches to history teaching is maintained at later levels. It is also apparent that opportunities for specialization and for personal  research are already well-developed at both the OU and Deakin. Common to both programs is the carefully graded use of sources and applied methodology at different levels--providing the student with &quot;hands on&quot; experience in the use of historical sources and data in personal research appropriate to his/her stage of development and study. Perhaps most vital to the success of distance teaching in historical studies both at the OU and at Deakin is the inter-active nature of the teaching and the various course components. Central to this is the &quot;tutorial in print&quot; pioneered by the OU--which involves the teacher in a direct one-to-one relationship with the student. (BZ)",

The third section, &quot;Criticisms of the  Logical-Analytical Model of Reflective Inquiry,&quot; criticizes the assumptions, nature, and application of the model most dominating current inquiry presentations.

        "description":"One aspect of teacher behavior in which teachers appear as brokers of policies, changing and modifying their behavior to meet multiple expectations, is reported in this study. Nine elementary school teachers were observed at work in an attempt to relate what they did to the web of educational policy surrounding them. The purpose was to gain a snapshot of their teaching behavior rather than an ethnography of their occupational lives. Field notes were taken on what the teacher did, what students did, the use of resources, and the interaction with the environment. Through interviews with the teachers, explanations were sought for behaviors. The teachers were seen as negotiators in interactions with students and also between the educational policy within which they operated and their  classroom practices. The patterning effects of policy were seen in five different areas: (1) lesson content; (2) text use; (3) program structure; (4) resource rationing; and (5) internalization of the organization's mission. Within each area, teachers also engaged in policy negotiation, either explicitly with school administrators or tacitly in the particular way they responded to policy dictates. (JD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to learn about teachers' thinking processes as they attempted to implement in their classrooms two recently acquired models of teaching. The first, the concept attainment strategy, focused on having students categorize people, places, or events into classes according to certain cues provided by positive or negative exemplars. The second, the synectics strategy, had the teacher lead students through a series of direct analogies, personal analogies, and compressed conflicts activities that were designed to induce metaphoric thinking and increase the likelihood of inducing creative thinking. The subjects were 10 teachers attending an intensive 4-week training program on the models; the training paradigm was theory, demonstration, practice, feedback and  coaching. Data gathered through classroom observation and a stimulated-recall process were analyzed and discussed according to the four questions that guided the study: (1) As a result of the training program, did the teachers regularly use each new model of teaching and did they maintain or improve their skill in using each new model of teaching? (2) Are there differences in the cognitive productivity by the teachers when using the two models of teaching? (3) Are there differences in how the teachers were thinking when using the concept attainment strategy as compared to the synectics strategy? and (4) Are there differences in what the teachers were thinking when using the concept attainment as compared to the synectics strategy?

Information is presented for those who have responsibility or interest in state level policies for using such tests to promote educational quality. Using institutional stages of a teacher's career as an organizing scheme for test use, the paper provides a framework for examining a range of policy options, discusses requirements for tests to support different decisions, and identifies issues important to implementing these options. Focus is upon paper and pencil testing as a policy tool because of the tremendous amount of interest it has received in the past few years. It is advocated that testing be considered as only one of many means to control teacher quality. As a  backdrop for examining teacher testing policy, three fundamental questions are posed: (1) Why test teachers? (2) What decisions will teacher testing support? and (3) What are the requirements for tests? A framework addressing these dimensions of teacher testing policy is offered to help policy makers analyze the appropriateness of specific policy options. It offers information for: (1) examining whether a testing option under review will be consistent with the underlying purposes of the policies; (2) identifying decisions supported by the testing; and (3) revealing technical and legal requirements of the tests to be used. Guidelines are offered for avoiding the primary pitfalls of teacher testing programs. (JD)",

Local mores constitute teaching knowledge held and used like the folkways and mostly based on them, yet local mores are more variable and likely to be articulated as maxims or missions. Teachers' private views are personally compelling, arising from the peculiar experiences, feelings, and characteristics of individuals. What marks off teaching expertise from the folkways, local mores, and private views is less what associated knowledge is about than how it is held and used. Although it can build  on the folkways, teaching expertise goes beyond their mastery or skilled performance by including (a) judgments of appropriateness, testing of consequences, and considerations of ends rather than means, and (b) less typical modes of practice, such as explanation, discussion, and the deliberate management of value dilemmas. This paper analyzes, in detail, the &quot;folkways of teaching,&quot; arguing that they are known by acquaintance, through participation, and as common sense. (Author/JD)",

The paper identifies four essential preconditions that must be in place if teachers are to motivate effectively and then provides descriptions and examples of four sets of motivational strategies: strategies for maintaining students' success expectations, strategies for supplying extrinsic motivation, strategies for capitalizing on existing intrinsic motivation, and strategies for stimulating student motivation to learn the knowledge or skills that academic activities are designed to develop. The last set of strategies is given special emphasis because these strategies have been  relatively neglected in writings on motivation in the classroom, even though these are the only strategies that will directly stimulate the type of high-quality engagement in academic content that is the heart of students' motivation to learn. The examples are drawn mostly from junior high social studies classes, although the principles apply to all grade levels and subject matter areas. (A six-page reference list concludes the document.)

        "description":"Because certain teacher behaviors which maximize student engagement in learning have been found to increase student achievement, the sources of those behaviors provide an important focus for research on teaching. The finding that teachers treat children of different gender, race/ethnicity, or ability in ways that may have deleterious consequences for subgroups of children has been a recurrent theme in classroom research. One important source of teacher behavior is teacher judgments about how best to respond to students during public recitation. This paper examines how student gender, race/ethnicity, behavior, and ability influence prospective and practicing teachers' judgments about how to respond to students who answer questions incorrectly during hypothetical episodes of  reading recitation. During the sessions, student behavior and ability significantly influenced teachers' judgments: Teachers were more &quot;sustaining&quot; toward on-task students than off-task students and more sustaining toward low-ability students than high-ability students. There were no main effects of gender or race, but interactions including behavior, ability, gender, and race suggested that student characteristics influence the purposes for which sustaining behaviors are used and the messages they conveny.

States differ in their definition of competence, in the methods they use to assess competence, and in the treatment of teachers who do not meet competency requirements. This monograph describes a national survey examining the variety of state teacher competency examination programs. Definitions of terms associated with teacher competence (teacher effectiveness, teacher competency, teacher performance) are offered. The 20-item questionnaire is described and the methods used in analyzing responses are discussed. Results showed minor differences among testing programs, such as testing of all supervisory staff or the number of retakes to be  allowed failing candidates. There was minimal disagreement on major issues, and there was a consensus that the results of the teacher competency examination be used for certifying teachers rather than for merit pay or salary decisions.

In using RPOS or IRT, a high bias and root mean squared error were shown for equating the verbal and analytical measures, whereas a small amount of bias and a moderate  amount of root mean squared error were shown for equating the quantitative measure. In using NREAT, quantitative equatings had moderate amounts of both bias and root mean squared error. Small amounts of bias and root mean squared error were shown in equating for the verbal measure.

        "description":"This paper (1) identifies strategies for assessing student instructional needs so that educational prescriptions can be developed to promote learning; and (2) relates the identification of student needs to the development of learning prescriptions. The population discussed includes high school and college students who because of social, economic, political, or educational reasons have not had adequate opportunity to master the basic skills in mathematics and reading. Student needs may be assessed using informal strategies such as interviews, anecdotal information, and grades. Formal methods include specialized surveys, student questionnaires, and tests. Norm-referenced achievement or aptitude tests are economical, effective methods of assessment, when they are valid and based on  relevant objectives. However, they may not be valid and reliable for a special, minority sample. Criterion-referenced and mastery tests are useful when their content is similar to the subject objectives. Diagnostic tests may have low reliability and high intercorrelations among subtests, but may be useful in assessing learning disabilities. Information from these tests can be incorporated into a diagnostic or prescriptive learning program based on students' knowledge, capacity to learn, and weaknesses. This process is described, as are some effective prescriptive instructional programs. (GDC)",

        "description":"The Council of Chief State School Officers has raised some issues pertinent to the implementation of a national project to collect statistical indicators of academic achievement and to compare them across states. The United States Department of Education shares this concern, with an emphasis on sampling schools for a school level analysis which may be aggregated to the state level. Three issues raised by the Chiefs include the identification of subject matter domains for assessment, the scale for analysis and reporting of results, and the administration and standardization of testing across the states. Potential problems with national testing include the following: (1) redirection of state or local curriculum goals; (2) high costs of a better method of cross-state comparisons  than the current Wall Chart; (3) separating the effects of student differences from curriculum or teaching effects; (4) difficulty in making useful conclusions from long-term testing; (5) conflict between state and local data indicators; (6) selection of a model which does not restrict data collection and analysis; and (7) practical implementation problems. Testing programs in five Northwestern states are briefly summarized: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Montana has no state testing program. (GDC)",

        "description":"Without support, financial, organizational and otherwise, the U.S. national IEA writing study would never have been conducted; however, implementation of the study was difficult. Planning for the study and its support commenced in 1980, coterminous with two important occurrences: the National Institute of Education pulled back on its interest in funding research in the area of writing assessment at the Center for the Study of Evaluation (CSE) at UCLA and federal economic policies produced considerable shrinkage in federal and other funds available for research. CSE supported its design and planning phases. Additional support for the design of the international study and test development was provided by the University of Illinois, the International Steering Committee, and the  Spencer Foundation. Since CSE already had ongoing writing assessments in a number of states, state funding was sought to continue independent programs, which were to serve as replicates. Although the state support was not found to be fully compliant with IEA requirements, public pressure concerning writing competence and lobbying by educators resulted in a large grant from the MacArthur Foundation for data collection and training for the scoring. Federal and state agencies were helpful in minimizing the data collection costs. Additional federal support was used for scoring and preliminary data analyses. Several factors were concluded to be significant: (1) professionals' commitment; (2) consideration of a variety of funding sources; (3) power of good data; (4) value of collaboration among  existing networks; and (5) collaboration with states and local school districts.

Although it has reviewed close to 700 projects in its 15-year history, the JDRP is still not widely known in the field of evaluation. This paper analyzes the JDRP process and its evaluation practices and contrasts it with evaluation criteria of the National Science Teachers Association and with effective schools research. This paper further analyzes the JDRP through the use of the Standards for Evaluations of Educational Programs, Projects and Materials, developed by the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. The standards are grouped in four areas: usability, feasibility, propriety, and  accuracy. Results highlight those elements of an evaluation to which the JDRP attends and how this has influenced the composition of projects it reviews and approves. (Author/JAZ)",

Data was collected from high school students on two types of spatial items: three-dimensional cubes and hidden figure items. The analysis of the three-dimensional cubes focused on the fit of the simplest possible item response model capable of modeling response time; the analysis of the hidden figure item focused on the feasibility of generating items from an algorithm in such a way that the psychometric characteristics of the generated items were predictable. The results for the three-dimensional cube items suggested that angular disparity can be used effectively to control the difficulty of true items, but this was not  the case for false items. That is, true and false items appear to measure different aspects of performance, and as a result, a multidimensional item response model may be necessary to fully account for performance. The analysis of the hidden figure item 3 showed that an item generation algorithm can be formulated to produce items of similar psychometric characteristics. The practical and theoretical implication of the results are discussed. (Author/JAZ)",

As part of its efforts to assess the educational and social development of its students, DoDDS participated in the longitudinal study, High School and Beyond. The purpose of the present study was to describe those DoDDS sophomores who had stayed in the same high school over the two-year period 1980-1982. The overall pattern of findings paralleled those in the wider high school population. Four conclusions emerge from the analyses: (1) the data are very limited and generalizations have limited utility; (2) the students who stayed in the same high school differed significantly from those who left; (3) the pattern of relations between stayers' characteristics  (such as gender, race, socioeconomic status) and cognitive test performance, employment, and plans for college are similar to the patterns reported for high school students at large; and (4) data on time spent on homework and time spent watching television suggest that DoDDS officials might consider policies that increase the homework.

All tests are generally administered in grades 3, 6, 9, and 11. The tests which have been selected for the West Virginia program have changed since the program's inception in 1962. The newest student questionnaire now contains items on the amount of help needed by students in study skills, career planning, educational planning, and decision-making skills. Test results generated are related to the performance of students,  individually and as groups within a school, a county, a region, and the state. It was concluded that CTBS achievement was quite good and exceeded the national norm in grades 3, 6, and 9. Students' career interests focused heavily on medical and health occupations. Interest in various subject areas, or favorite subjects, tended to decrease in the higher grades. A number of sample forms are appended. (GDC)",

Variables statistically controlled were intactness of the family, father's employment status, the child's sex, the child's race, and the family's socioeconomic status. It was hypothesized that the period in the child's life in which the mother worked accounted for a significant amount of variance in predicting the child's self-concept and/or family orientation and that there were significant differences in the self-concept and/or family orientation of high school students according to whether their mothers worked or never worked. Data from High School and Beyond, a national longitudinal study of high school sophomores  and seniors, was used. An ex post facto design was employed, and regression model comparisons were written to reflect the questions of interest. The F-test was used to test for statistical significance of the hypothesized relationships. Effect sizes were calculated for all models and used to determine practical significance. No significant interactions were found, and the hypotheses were found to be insignificant. This indicated that both self-concept and family orientation were not significantly related to maternal employment.

Part One identifies the effects of province-wide examinations for selected high school courses and proposes four studies to monitor these effects: (1) an analysis of data collected routinely by the Ministry of Education to assess enrollment trends and marking standards; (2) a survey of teachers to collect information about effects on curriculum; (3) a public opinion poll; and (4) an experiment of another aspect of the effects that examinations might have on marking standards. Part Two proposes studies for tracking the effects on: (1) variation in teacher marks; (2) the evidence teachers collect and use  to evaluate achievement; (3) the implemented curriculum; (4) teacher's marking standards; (5) public perceptions of achievement in education and assessment; and (6) board policies governing the use of assessment results for personnel evaluation and promotion. Part Three is a review of the literature on testing effects divided into two sections: examinations and assessments. On the basis of the literature review, it was concluded that studies of the effects of either an examination or an assessment program on Ontario Education would not duplicate research done elsewhere.

        "description":"The instructional components of mediation, a teaching technique used in dynamic assessment, were evaluated with 100 four-year-old children attending daycare or preschools in London, Ontario. The effects of familiarization with task materials, task-specific rule teaching, and elaborated feedback were assessed using a pretest-posttest design. Children trained on the Stencil Design Test using various combinations of the mediation components were compared to each other and to a non-instructed control group. Analyses of covariance on posttest measures with type of instruction as the independent variable and pretest scores as the covariate revealed that feedback was the most effective component of the mediation procedure. Performance on the Stencil Design Test and near transfer  performance on the Animal Stencil Test was significantly better than performance of non-instructed control children whenever feedback was included in instruction on the Stencil Design Test. There was no transfer to the Animal House Coding Task of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence, or to the Conceptual Grouping subtest of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Results were discussed in terms of the importance of understanding the nature of the instruction provided in dynamic assessment. (Author/JAZ)",

Additional issues addressed were: (1) setting learning in the context of the cultural framework, curricular emphases and teaching practices, rather than just determining the level of achievement, and (2) making it possible for each participating country/school system to assess its relative strengths and weaknesses in writing instruction against an international background. Papulations for the study were chosen from 3 stages of schooling and from 14 countries. Each student in the sample populations wrote at least 3 compositions from a total corpus of 14 different task versions. The compositions were supplemented by background information supplied in questionnaires completed  by students, teachers, and school administrators. The rationale for the instruments used and the expected results of the study are outlined. (JAZ)",

The paper opens with a report of studies carried out on natural father and stepfather incestuous families, and this opens up the issue of the appropriateness of both types of research methodologies. Differences found in the types of incest, and responses of families to treatment, illustrate findings that would not have been uncovered had either methodology been used to the exclusion of the other. The argument is made that the dichotomization of quantitative and qualitative techniques is both misleading and unnecessary. The methodological issues are rather ones of judgment about what will yield  needed information in a given investigation. The paper also gives some attention to the related issue of which methodological approaches are appropriate when a fresh line of inquiry is beginning in a field; and mention is made of an obvious issue that arises in dealing with incest--the handling of \"sensitive\" research problems.

        "description":"Based on the premise that secondary school improvement is a result of change at both local high school and school district levels, this study surveyed both superintendents and principals of schools engaged in improvement activities in 35 large urban school districts. Superintendents were asked to identify areas of school improvement in which policy or planning statements had been developed and to characterize the role their district played in school improvement efforts. Partially overlapping the Superintendent Survey, the Principal Survey investigated the following: (1) areas of school effectiveness where plans or policies exist; (2) the district's role in supporting school improvement efforts; (3) special areas of initiating and monitoring school improvement; and (4)  self-reported impacts of their school improvement efforts. Perceptions at the central and school levels were generally quite similar. Approximately 80 percent in each group detected some impact from school improvement activities. Increased basic skills scores and increased business/community support were reported by the largest percentages. Approximately 80 percent of districts reported increased academic graduation requirements. About half of the districts are targeting school improvement efforts to special student populations, especially educationally disadvantaged and early school leavers. Appendices contain the Council of the Great City Schools' listing of secondary school improvement issues, the Council's Policy Statement on Equity and Excellence, a tabulation of responses to the two  surveys, and a listing of types of documents received from the district and schools to facilitate exchange of school improvement ideas.

The typical pattern for leavers is to complete some portion of the school year before dropping out. The greatest dropout activity occurs in January, February, and March. Typical school leavers: (1) are bored with school; (2) find school activities and classes a waste of time; (3) are behind in school credits; (4) make poor grades; and (5) have numerous home and family responsibilities. Most leavers held very positive attitudes about education, learning, and the importance of a high school diploma; 84 percent would not advise friends or relatives to leave high school before graduating. While 71.5 percent of early school leavers had attempted in  some way to find employment, only 29.4 percent had obtained full-time employment and 21.7 percent, part-time employment. These leavers, however, were not taking action to exert more control over their lives. The leavers voiced future plans vaguely, most of them saying that they hoped to graduate some time in the future. The report concludes that although the youngsters studied placed a high value on education, they had many complaints, difficulties, and problems with their experience in high school. (LHW)",

This annual study for the 1983-84 school year examines the number of students in grades 10 through 12 who left school without a diploma. Findings cover all regular senior high schools, opportunity schools, and magnet school programs. Comparison data provided are based on the following: (1) sex, (2) grade, (3) age, (4) ethnicity, and (5) reason for leaving. Significant facts include the following: (1) the 10,555 early leavers represent a slight increase from previous years; (2) more than 60 percent of leavers left during the second semester; (3) most early leavers are male; (4) continuation high  schools had the largest percentage of leavers; (5) magnet schools had the fewest leavers of all non-special-education programs; (6) the percentage of early leavers (8.1 percent) was the highest since the district began its studies; (7) &quot;whereabouts unknown&quot; and &quot;overage&quot; represent over 60 percent of early leavers; and (8) the number of early leavers at grade 10 is higher than grades 11 and 12. It is recommended that the district should train teachers and counselors to identify potential early school leavers and provide them with counseling services. Early prevention programs to help students before the 10th grade, presention programs to help students before the 10th grade, and efforts to find students shortly after they leave school to encourage them back into an educational program are  also suggested. Nine data tables are appended. (LHW)",

The first, most obvious approach, focuses on the provision of knowledge. The second approach starts with a focus on individual development. Its aim is to facilitate students' maturation so that they are able to inform their discretion with sufficient sophistication to enable them to support the healthy continuation of the society. The philosophic issues of perfectibility and will are important in the perception of students in correctional education. Undoubtedly, a strong relationship exists between thinking and acting and thus between thinking and crime. Education carries within it the potential for  enabling criminals to perceive the world differently and make the decision to act upon it differently. Descriptions and data indicate prisons contain a rather coherent class or caste of errant citizens with a predisposition to offend. They have been portrayed as decision maker, bandit, and social victim. The content and quality of their lives have had a direct effect on the way they think, on the cognitive structure that determines how they decide to act. Correctional educators must inform their students' discretion, making them active participants in imagining and creating their futures. (YLB)",

        "description":"Data from the October 1983 education supplement to the Current Population Survey were examined to determine school enrollment of male veterans and nonveterans 20-34 years old. Overall, 16 percent of nonveterans and 11.1 percent of veterans were enrolled. Differences existed among 5-year age groups. Only in the youngest group, aged 20-24 years, were nonveterans more likely to be enrolled than veterans. Veterans in the two oldest groups, ages 25-29 and 30-34, were more likely to be enrolled in school than nonveterans. Veterans were much less likely than nonveterans to be enrolled below the college level, but they were more likely to be enrolled in \"special schools.\" At the college level, enrollment for veterans and nonveterans was similar. Only a small proportion (about 7 percent)  of both veterans and nonveterans employed full-time were enrolled in school. A much higher proportion of part-time workers were enrolled: 60 percent of veterans and over 70 percent of nonveterans. More than 26 percent of veterans and only about 10 percent of nonveterans who were full-time college students worked full-time. Between 1978 and 1983 the proportion of veterans enrolled in college declined; the proportion of nonveterans enrolled increased. (YLB)",

In addition to presenting cross-tabulated responses for survey questions on recruits' reasons for enlisting, principal components analyses were completed on these data. These analyses indicated that six distinct factors underlying recruits' enlistment motivation could be identified.

The first data set contained written and hands-on tests on several weapons systems from the Army's training schools. The second data set used the Skill Qualifications Tests administered by the Army. Performance measures were formed into a multivariate regression model, using an instrumental variables technique to correct for measurement error in the AFQT variable. Other explanatory variables were sex, race, education, Army experience, and training. The results demonstrated that a statistically significant and positive relationship existed between AFQT scores and performance measures. AFQT, a measure of  trainability, was a significant predictor of performance in the Army. These findings were consistent across a wide range of Military Occupational Specialties (MOS). No other variables were consistently significant across all MOS in both data sets. (YLB)",

It discusses why the agency charged with transmitting literacy, the public school system, has not satisfactorily accomplished this task and recommends improvements to reduce and eradicate illiteracy. Part 1 focuses on the confusion about the extent of illiteracy because of varying definitions of literacy. The relationship between literacy and the economy is discussed in light of business and industrial needs for and concern over the lack of a literate work force. Other factors affecting estimates of illiteracy are highlighted. Part 2 considers causation by examining how each of the various elements woven into the fabric of education contribute to the decline in literacy. The discussion  centers on an examination of the changes resulting from three important shifts in American culture and education: a philosophical shift from traditional to progressive, a societal shift from traditional to permissive, and a governance shift from local to state and federal and from lay to professional. The issue of holding schools responsible is addressed. Part 3 offers recommendations for prevention of the problem with accompanying explanations. These are made in response to the three shifts discussed in section 2. A conclusion summarizes stated and implied recommendations. A list of 288 references is included. (YLB)",

        "description":"High personnel loss rates among recruits who have signed up for the Army's Delayed Entry Program (DEP) are becoming an increasing problem for DEP program managers. Therefore, a research project was conducted to examine DEP loss as a function of sociodemography and policy variables at the microdata level. Two DEP loss models were created. The first included high school graduates and nongraduates, and the second included high school seniors. In each model, several scenarios were staged to measure different combinations of the following variables: age, gender, Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score, education, contracted DEP length, military occupational specialty (MOS), region of the country, and enlistment and incentive options. A logistic regression (logit) model that  estimates loss probabilities on an individual basis was specified, and categories of high- and low-risk individuals were identified. The multivariate analysis revealed that the following variables were associated with higher DEP loss: signing up for a longer DEP length, being female, choosing to participate in the Army College Fund, and being a high school graduate or nongraduate as opposed to a high school senior. The model was found to present a significant improvement over previous research because it permits measurement of the effects of changing several parameters simultaneously, thereby allowing for the prediction of DEP loss probability on an individual basis.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress studied a nationally representative sample of 3,600 young American adults, aged 21 to 25, to determine how well they could perform real work survival skills. While the overwhelming majority of young adults adequately performs tasks at the lower levels of proficiency, sizable numbers appear unable to do well on tasks of even moderate complexity. Findings included the following: (1) about 80 percent were unable to use a bus schedule; (2) approximately 63 percent could not follow directions using a map; (3) only about 27 percent could interpret a lengthy newspaper  feature story; (4) about 28 percent were unable to write a letter protesting a billing error; (5) about 3 percent could not enter personal information on a job application; (6) about 21 percent were unable to locate the gross pay-to-date on a pay stub; (7) about 16 percent had trouble completing an address on an order form; and (8) about 34 percent had difficulty summarizing in writing an argument made in a lengthy newspaper editorial. On average, black young adults performed at levels significantly below white young adults, with Hispanics about midway between the groups. The report concluded that more appropriate intervention and prevention strategies must be developed to remedy these deficits. (KC)",

The common factor is a facilitator who works in some way with the student in the learning process. They display different characteristics, including the extent of independence in relation to content and/or process. Nondirective tutorial instruction and learning contracts provide two alternative approaches to classes for one-to-one teaching. The nondirective model works when students do not have a clear focus at the beginning and where an exploratory approach to the learning process is beneficial. The learning contract is particularly useful for students who have a clear sense of direction and wish to achieve specific goals. Tough and Griffin provide good models for group-based situations.  Tough's &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; model can be used where there is core material to be shared by all, while Griffin's emphasis is on group support. The competency-based model suggests that instruction can be flexible, particularly for learners at a distance. Correspondence materials can be made available on a learner-paced basis. This model can work only when people must have or desire specific skills. (A reference list is appended.) (YLB)",

Data were collected from classroom observations; interviews with students, teachers, administrators, and counselors; and written survey instruments assessing student career development, vocational maturity, and demographic characteristics. Vocational education was found to play an important role in helping students build competence, apply basic skills, think through problems, learn technical skills, explore life roles, learn to work together, express themselves, extend themselves to the community, and practice life roles. Within the context of secondary education, vocational education was found to provide a change of pace from other  experiences in the comprehensive high school. However, although the benefits of vocational education are clear, vocational students were frequently confronted with mixed perceptions by other students and by teachers about the value of their vocational education. Vocational education was found to help students in five ways. It helped students experience an egalitarian atmosphere and cooperation and teamwork, provided learning activities relevant to students' lives, gave teachers an opportunity to know their students well, and helped students develop self-esteem. It was concluded that those responsible for planning, administering, and teaching vocational education should continue to be creative and challenge students beyond their expectations, clarify the purpose of vocational education,  and continue to provide new areas for student exploration without becoming so specialized as to narrow students' opportunities.

        "description":"A study examined the issue of educational equity in vocational education in 14 classrooms at 8 public secondary schools in Minnesota. The study used a naturalistic inquiry approach based on classroom observations and interviews with students, teachers, administrators, and counselors. Each of the members of the research team prepared a different section of this study report. Jane Plihal discussed the purpose and design of the study. In a section entitled &quot;Gaining Access to Vocational Education: Ticket to Equity?&quot; Marsha Rehm concluded that the focus in the programs observed was on low- and middle-ability students and discusses the dilemma posed when vocational programs are viewed as dumping grounds for students with lesser abilities and when classrooms contain students  representing extreme ranges of ability and interest levels. In her paper &quot;Treatment within Vocational Education Classrooms: How Equitable?&quot; Linda Ernst concluded that student access to knowledge is the major equity concern once students enter a vocational classroom. She discussed several practices that enable all students to benefit from vocational education. The benefits of vocational education to all types of students, and especially to students who might not benefit from other types of programs, are examined in Linda Ernst's paper &quot;Outcomes of Vocational Education: Blessing or Burden?&quot; Jane Plihal's report, &quot;Perspectives,&quot; summarizes cynics' and advocates' perspectives about access to, treatment in, and outcomes of vocational education.

        "description":"A project was undertaken to develop a means of simplifying instruction in postsecondary vocational-technical programs in practical nursing and auto/truck maintenance and repair and to identify related patterns of student achievement, retention in a program, and transfer of learning. Information obtained from a literature review indicated that a whole-to-part instructional approach supplemented with detailed task analysis offered a possible solution to the problem of simplifying the technical complexities in the content of postsecondary vocational training programs. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of a whole-to-part instructional approach with a study population consisting of 151 practical nursing and auto-track mechanics students and 13  teachers participating in three programs at a postsecondary vocational technical institute in Minnesota. Data obtained using the California Achievement Test and the Hidden Figures Test and data on student characteristics were analyzed by means of correlation and regression procedures. Because no clear patterns of intervariable relationships emerged, it was impossible to establish conclusive linkages between the whole-to-part instructional approach and the measures of achievement, retention, and transfer used in the pilot study. However, most of the students completed the program successfully, and the instructors indicated a belief that the whole-to-part instructional approach contributed to this success.

The material was collected during a year-long review of current studies of secondary schools, 20th-century perspectives on vocational education and its specific fields, the purposes of education in general, future social and economic forces, and key concepts often used to define the purpose of vocational education. The volume is divided into eight parts. The importance of readdressing the purpose of vocational education in the secondary schools and the implications of current studies of secondary education are discussed. Examined  in the next three sections are 20th-century perspectives on the purpose of vocational education; specific fields within vocational education (agricultural, business, distributive, home economics, and industrial education); and education in general. The implications of future economic, social, and technological trends for vocational education are outlined. The following key concepts are discussed in a section on developing a purpose statement for vocational education: development; individual differences; education; vocation; work; and the ethics, aesthetics, and epistemology of work. The final part reflects on the contribution to and unique purpose of vocational education in secondary education and the questions that should be asked about vocational education's purposes when deliberating  on the needs of individual secondary schools. Each section includes selected quotations, a summary, and references. Concluding the volume is an epilogue by Harry F. Silberman. (MN)",

Literature on participation in and barriers to participation in adult education was reviewed as was literature on the clientele served by adult vocational education, changes in the workplace that have impinged on vocational education, and the currency of vocational education. The review of literature on distance education focused on works dealing with the following topics: factors affecting learning, effects of distance delivery on teaching and teachers, conditions encouraging the use of distance delivery, barriers to the use of technology, and effectiveness of distance  delivery. The following were determined to be areas in which further research is needed: effect of interaction of learning tasks, learners, and modes of distance delivery on learning outcomes; teaching behaviors that enhance student learning in a distance delivery context; barriers to adults' participation in vocational education that might be overcome by the use of distance delivery; conditions and outcomes that justify the cost of distance delivery; and characteristics of technologies used in education.

        "description":"Programs to aid disadvantaged youth in making the transition from school to work are often lacking or underdeveloped. As a result, many disadvantaged youth become unemployed, and more than half of disabled adults are unemployed. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act contains provisions for vocational services for special populations. This legislation's emphasis on special populations means that vocational education planners should assess local needs, gather new forms of information on student populations, and use new decision-making tools to plan and manage vocational education programs. The following improvements in current vocational programs are recommended to persons seeking to provide more effective services to disadvantaged learners: (1) the transition of  disadvantaged youth and adults into vocational education programs can be improved by effective management of relevant information, effective recruitment practices, and appropriate counseling and assessment practices; (2) individualized planning should be improved and expanded, with supportive counseling to assure that student interests are genuine and that a match is made between student characteristics and program performance variables; and (3) additional transition assistance should be provided beyond the point at which students have completed their instruction within vocational programs. There will continue to be a need for local education agencies to review and revise policies and programs to assure that disadvantaged learners receive maximum benefits while participating in vocational  training programs. Such improvements should also address individuals' efforts to make the transition from school to careers as meaningfully employed adults. (KC)",

Methodology involved a highly personal interaction with the program worker. Three groups were formed--two were conducted in English and one was conducted in Spanish. Project goals were to educate the students about vocational possibilities, available training resources, sexuality, and drugs and their effects; explore and challenge their attitudes and fears regarding vocation, sex, culture, and independence; clarify and increase commitment to educational goals; involve parents in their children's vocational goals; and provide expert, appropriate referral to adolescents experiencing serious problems. A holistic, replicable  approach to vocational education and motivation for inner-city, bicultural teenage girls was to be developed. Research data on &quot;positive significant changes&quot; were inconclusive over the seven-month project. Two important conclusions were the importance of field trips and the need for individual and family therapy. The appendices provide a segment of the questionnaire and resumes of project staff.

The study population consisted of 45 full-time industrial education teachers who taught in small, medium, and large departments (15 teachers from each category) in public comprehensive high schools located in downstate Illinois outside Chicago and its suburbs. Telephone interviews were used to gather data on the aforementioned variables, and the teachers' responses were recorded by using a six-point Likert-type scale. More than half of the teachers either did not intend to continue teaching or were unsure if they would continue teaching for the next five years. Low correlations were found  between the decision to quit teaching and each of two measures: (1) mean satisfaction; and (2) satisfaction with salary and benefits. There was essentially no correlation between the intention to quit teaching and either mean actual esteem or mean actual autonomy, although the intention to quit teaching had a moderate negative correlation with principal recognition. There was essentially no correlation between the stated intention to quit teaching and any of the demographic characteristics examined. A multiple regression approach to predict general satisfaction identified principal recognition, satisfaction with teaching assignment, years in current assignment, and age, respectively, as accounting for 39 percent of the variance in general satisfaction.

(Gainsharing programs measure gains in employee productivity and share the resulting savings between employees and the organization.) Analysis of private sector studies on gainsharing efforts identified three major trends in private sector efforts: (1) gainsharing by programs based on organization-wide productivity measurement are replacing those programs based on individuals or small group productivity measurements; (2) high success rates are being achieved by organizational-based programs; and (3) employee participation systems are being incorporated into gainsharing programs. All the gainsharing efforts in DOD reported cost savings. Some installations  reported indirect benefits, including decreased sick leave usage and reductions in work backlogs and overtime costs. Major barriers to gainsharing programs were lack of specific legislation authorizing such programs and absence of Office of Personnel Management policies and guidance. Four principal elements critical to the success of gainsharing programs were identified: continuous and visible top management support, employee participation systems, definable and accurate performance measures, and adequate workloads to absorb productivity increases.

It begins by discussing the literacy context of a military career to provide a perspective on how literacy is or may be used in the services. The demands for literacy are shown to be much higher than for comparable civilian careers. Discussion then focuses on the development of literacy programs in the military, focusing on the evolving concept of literacy. Finally, the paper examines the current literacy policy, the major literacy programs under development, and the innovative uses of technology in literacy instruction.

Therefore, the question for schools is not whether to buy but rather what to buy. An effective strategy for purchasing CAD software should include the following steps: formation of a selection committee, comprehensive research on the concepts of CAD, formulation of a rationale for purchase, consideration of at least 15 points before selecting a CAD system, and negotiation with several vendors once a CAD system has been chosen. There are three approaches to establishing CAD competencies in any drafting setting. Instruction in CAD can be  introduced (1) after students have developed proficiency in manual skills and a drafting discipline, (2) by establishing competency in a drafting discipline using computers instead of drawing boards, or (3) by first establishing an elementary competency in a drafting discipline using freehand sketching and then using CAD and manual skills together for industrial-quality work. Regardless of the integration method chosen, students working with CAD software need to develop prerequisite competencies in basic programming, trigonometry and analytical geometry, and a drafting discipline. (Appendixes to this report include lists of publishers of recommended course materials and microcomputer CAD software vendors, a form for evaluating CAD systems, and a directory of microcomputer CAD systems for  education.)

It determined the relationship between attitudes and participation in adult education and identified differences between the attitudes of subgroups of the adult population. A total of 275 adults from the central New Jersey area completed the Adults' Attitudes toward Continuing Education scale, which included 22 items on a five-point Likert scale. Seven items represented attitude-to-situation; the remaining items measured attitude-to-object. An index collected information about behavior related to adult education. Overall, the sample expressed generally favorable attitudes toward continuing education. Significant relationships existed between attitudes and sex, level of educational  attainment, and family income. More favorable attitudes were also correlated with behavior as measured by the behavioral index. The identification of behavior as the single most important predictor of attitude suggested the importance of attitude research to a greater understanding of the differences between participants and nonparticipants in adult education.

Since decolonization after World War II, developing countries have had to cope with depleted primary resources and unprecedented and unexpectedly rapid industrialization. Industrialization has taken the form of technology transfer, which has contributed to the loss of indigenous technologies. The developing world is becoming aware that the key to its development lies not in transfer of capital-intensive technologies designed for use where labor is comparatively scarce, but in industrial development that uses those technologies that advance the socioeconomic objective of development. Training and development efforts in developing countries  should relate to an industrialization that uses technologies appropriate to specific environments. From a developing country's perspective, training and development have an important role in developing the capacity to use and control appropriate technology. Training and development must be dynamic and focus on an understanding of the respective country's culture in its transition from a low to a higher technology base. Implementation problems include cultural and linguistic diversity of the audience, poor communication, and limited or out-of-date instructional materials, facilities, and training and development personnel.

The students were classified as either vocational completers (32), vocational explorers (69), general academic (25), or college preparatory (33). The second part of the survey was conducted in July of 1986, approximately 13 months after the students left school. Ninety-two percent of the original 170 students surveyed were contacted. Of those contacted, 38.2 percent were employed full-time, 25.7 percent were working part-time, 9.0 percent were in the military, 6.25 percent were unemployed, and 3.5 percent were still finishing high school. Regarding the students' postsecondary educational status, 41.6  percent were attending school full-time, 9.7 percent were attending part-time, and 48.7 percent had not attended any postsecondary school. Of those attending school, 25 percent attended a four-year college, 21 percent attended a community college, and 6 percent attended a business or technical school. Of the vocational completers, 64.3 percent of those attending school were taking a program of study related to their high school vocational program and 55.7 percent of those employed were working in a job directly related to their high school vocational program. The average monthly wage of those working full-time was $766. Ninety-one percent of the vocational completers felt that their high school vocational programs were valuable. Although the students were satisfied with the job search  training when asked about it while still in school, they now felt that more such training would have been useful. (MN)",

        "description":"The quality and stability of sibling relationships during adulthood were assessed by comparing Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) themes of sibling affiliation, conflict, and separation at the periods of active child-rearing (CP) and the empty nest (EN). Thirty men and 30 women, equally divided between the two life stages, were randomly selected within a designated neighborhood from a pool of married people with a same-sex sibling within 3 years of their age. The relationship with this sibling was targeted because it is usually a highly charged one, both positively and negatively. A projective instrument, the Sibling Thematic Apperception Test, was used to elicit underlying feelings about the relationship, because traditional methods of assessment have failed to tap the negative  qualities of sibling relationships. Results showed no differences in affiliation theme frequencies for the CP and EN men and women contrary to previous findings. Separation themes, however, were more frequent for CP than for EN men and women, suggesting that the desire to separate from siblings reflects a developmental process related to bonding with the family of procreation. Although there were no sex differences within life periods, stories about sisters had more conflict themes than stories about brothers, an unusual finding which might be attributed to the use of an in-depth approach.

        "description":"Memory studies involving older adults have typically been conducted in laboratory settings and have usually employed experimental tasks. Most results support cognitive decline. Most naturalistic experimental studies relate to spatial memory and test younger respondents. When older respondents are tested, the old sometimes outperform and sometimes underperform the young. Practice has not always been controlled. The rate at which respondents forget has not been examined. A study was conducted to examine everyday memory by investigating adults' memory for their daily experiences as volunteer participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Subjects were 43 men and 36 women between the ages of 23 and 93 who took part in the BLSA. Younger and older respondents were  given equal practice on everyday items and were tested three times within a 2-year period. Results demonstrated effects for time, with similar forgetting rates for young and old on almost all items. On two of three atypical items, the old forgot more slowly than did the young. These results suggest that for everyday memory items, at least, although absolute performance may be influenced by age and passage of time, the rate of forgetting may not be so influenced.

        "description":"One unintended consequence of juvenile diversion may be that diversion programs widen the net of justice system control, rather than divert youth from the system. This issue was examined in a group of youths who were randomly assigned to either the Adolescent Diversion Project (ADP) or to a control group who received services as usual by the court after referral by an intake referee at the court. Four methods of assessing the extent of net widening were used: (1) analysis of the court files of the first 62 control subjects to determine their eventual dispositions; (2) discriminant analysis of a random sample of court cases (N=253) and comparison to ADP cases (N=248); (3) analysis of questionnaire data provided by referees for 180 cases; and (4) analysis of system processing  rates. The results indicated that the ADP did not achieve the goal of reducing the court's formal caseload. Most of the diversion cases were diverted from the 30-day adjournment disposition, which usually involves minimal supervision and monitoring of behavior by an intake referee. These findings question the current value of diversion programs, given their tendency to expand the net of social control over the population of youth. (NB)",

In a major effort to divert certain individuals from institutionalization, a personal care option has been provided. Using data from the Preadmission Screening Program, a study was conducted to examine cases from intermediate care (N=133), skilled care (N=1,088), and community-based care (N=1,390). The results of tabular and logistic regression analyses were used to discuss explanatory models for recommended care settings in an elderly Medicaid population. Significant explanatory variables for recommendations in an institutional setting were consistent with a need for long term supervision  and care. Intermediate care recommendations were more often associated with individuals who were not mentally competent or had no one to provide informal support while skilled care individuals generally had specific nursing needs (dressings, decubitis ulcers, medication administration) and increased mobility restrictions while receiving rehabilitative care and services.

        "description":"Natural family planning (NFP) refers to techniques for planning or preventing pregnancy by observation of natural signs of fertility. In using natural family planning to avoid pregnancy, there is abstinence from sexual intercourse during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. Social values which are incorporated into the method include couples controlling and sharing responsibility for their own fertility and the fact that NFP does not interfere with physiological processes. Rhythm is considered to be an outmoded method which has been replaced by the ovulation or mucus method and the sympto-thermal method. A key concept of NFP is joint fertility since it is the life of the sperm and ovum together which constitute fertility. In a NFP satisfaction survey previously reported by  Borkman and Shivanandan, almost all couples who had been using NFP at least 2 years reported positive aspects of spousal communication as a part of NFP. Natural family planning communication provides cycle awareness for both spouses, thereby enabling the understanding of women's moods related to hormone levels. This cycle awareness, or fertility awareness, represents a new and unique form of communication for couples. Natural family planning is a mechanism for impacting communication, forcing at least minimal communication about the sexual relationship, and providing regular opportunities for discussion of intimate aspects of the relationship.

        "description":"Research has explored the relationships between older adults in need of help and the informal support systems of caregivers. A preliminary analysis was conducted to examine all major facets of gerontological caregiving relationships and to differentiate findings in each area by the sex of the caregiver. Subjects were 121 informal caregivers of elderly relatives who were clients of the Loretto Geriatric Center of Central New York. Subjects completed questionnaires about their thoughts, feelings, and actions relevant to caregiving and their relationships to the care receivers. The results revealed that 79% of the caregivers were women. The overwhelming majority were family members, 45% of whom were adult daughters, 11% adult sons, and 11% adult siblings. Most respondents reported  positive feelings about the caregiving relationship. Some sex differences were revealed: more women than men reported resentment toward non-helping relatives; more women than men felt their own health had suffered; and more men than women felt they did not do enough for the care received. These results say much about sex roles in American society and suggest implications with respect to social policy and the formal versus informal support systems of the elderly. A two-page reference list concludes the document. (NB)",

Materials presented here describe aproaches taken by various schools or school districts nationwide. Phase One concerns board of education policies. The offenses of simple possession or use of a drug and possession with intent to sell are differentiated and appropriate disciplinary action for first, second, and third offenses are considered. Suspension and the recommmendation for expulsion are discussed. Phase Two of the drug prevention approach involves various forms of hassling actions by the schools, designed to teach students that drug use is too risky to engage in at school. Five techniques are described: (1) locker visits; (2) hall passes; (3) the \"poor child must be sick\"  approach; (4) covert photography; and (5) the use of marijuana sniffing dogs. The use of dogs is described as a step-by-step procedure which will teach students that it is expensive and risky to bring drugs onto school grounds. (NB)",

Data from the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey (NBS) of 4,212 women and 5,307 men were examined to determine the employment of retired-worker beneficiaries who were working 18-30 months after first receiving retired-worker benefits. According to the NBS data, over one-fifth of new retired-worker beneficiaries were working 18-30 months after first receiving social security benefits. Most usually worked less than full time over the full year. Although measurement of changing hours in the NBS was imperfect, data suggest that part-time work results from employees decreasing their annual hours of work, primarily hours worked in a typical week. Retired-worker beneficiaries usually had modest annual earnings and  hourly wages. Those under age 65 earned lower amounts than those aged 65-71. Retired-worker beneficiaries worked in all categories of occupations, but there were extensive gender differences. While about 30 percent of women worked in different occupations for different employers than they had in their longest job, about 45 percent of men did so. Seven tables are provided. (NB)",

        "description":"The relationships between siblings in old age have not received much attention in social science literature. However, some researchers suggest that a reawakening of interest in and contact with siblings occurs for many people during the last part of life. Different kinds of sibling relationships that exist between older people and the ways in which each type meets or ignores the social and psychological needs of older people were examined in this study. Five types of sibling relationships emerged from data collected in open-ended interviews with 30 men and 30 women over the age of 65 who had at least one living sibling. The relationship types included Intimate (17%), the Congenial (28%), the Loyal (35%), the Apathetic (10%), and the Hostile (10%). Each type reflects a discrete  pattern of instrumental support, emotional support, and contact as well as a different degree of closeness, envy, resentment, approval, and involvement with the sibling. The distribution of same-sex and cross-sex dyads among the types suggests gender differences in sibling interactions. According to the responses of the participants in this study, although the sex of the respondent did not significantly affect the position of the dyad in typology, the gender composition of the dyad did. Examining sibling relations across the life span would increase our understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which life-long sibling loyalties are fostered. Tables and a three-page reference list are provided. (Author/ABL)",

Yet many studies, some using death certificates, show actual risk of institutionalization is upwards of 25 percent. This paper presents a death registration study that examined all deaths in North Carolina and analyzed rural and urban differences. The results indicated that the urban elderly were not, in practical terms, more likely than the rural elderly to die in hospitals and long term care facilities. Rural elderly who died in a hospital or nursing home were more likely to die in a facility outside their county of residence than were their urban counterparts. The lack of facilities may force the elderly to leave their county of residence. Rural elderly were not more likely than  urban elderly to die at home or outside of health facilities. However, this does not necessarily mean rural elderly do not enjoy stronger support networks than do their urban counterparts. The introduction of a nursing home into a rural county was related to a drastic reduction in the number of deaths which occurred in hospitals outside of the county and an increase in the number of long term care facility deaths. The introduction of a local nursing home, however, did not affect the percent of in-home deaths. Several tables are included. (ABL)",

        "description":"As growing numbers of families are being supported by two employed parents, it becomes increasingly important that clinicians and researchers understand the factors affecting how successfully families cope with the demands of this life style. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the structure of spouses' social networks and the coping styles used in two-income families. Seventy-nine couples, in one of four work arrangements (dual career, dual earner, mixed status, and traditional breadwinner/homemaker) participated in the study. Subjects completed a mailed questionnaire seeking demographic and social relationship information. Results suggest that couples in different work arrangements do vary in the way their social networks are structured, how they  interact with members of their networks, and the coping strategies they typically use. Dual career and mixed status couples appeared to be more autonomous or distant from their networks, both physically and behaviorally, than were dual earner and traditional couples. Their networks were less dense, had fewer kin, lived further away, and provided less frequent contact. The picture of coping strategies suggests that dual-earner couples are more likely to mobilize and seek community support, while dual-career couples are least likely to rely on spiritual support during stress. Data suggest that when stress is controlled for, structural network characteristics are not particularly helpful in understanding quality of life; most networks, regardless of their characteristics, operate fairly  similarly when life appears to be normal.

        "description":"An increasing number of studies have examined the movement patterns of older people between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in the United States. Most of these studies, however, have not considered whether the relocation patterns of older persons differ systematically from those of younger populations. The 1975-1980 migration stream and net migration patterns of over and under age 65 persons were examined using data from the 1980 U.S. Census. Central cities and suburbs of metropolitan areas (SMSAs) and nonmetropolitan areas (NonSMSAs) were distinguished as origins and destinations. The findings revealed that most elderly movers relocated within a fairly limited geographic context and revealed strong preferences for metropolitan living. Suburban locations were more favored  than central city locations. Net migration findings may provide misleading interpretations of older movers' locational choices. The migration patterns of the age 65 plus population were similar to those of the age 45 to 64 population, but differed from those of the more youthful U.S. populations. The findings highlight migration streams of elderly movers who have likely experienced changes in their life-styles or personal resources. (Author/NB)",

The System to Assure Elderly Services (STAES) located in St. Louis City (Missouri), mobilizes and trains elderly persons to become volunteers who serve other elderly persons. A study was conducted to investigate characteristics that distinguish the STAES elderly volunteers (N=83) from the elderly (N=246) they serve and to examine the characteristics of the elderly volunteers who spend more time providing services than others do. A survey instrument was used to collect data regarding four human capital resources (physical functioning, psychological adjustment, perceived health, and social resources), demographic  characteristics, and months spent in the STAES program. In addition, 63 volunteers kept one-week logs of the time they spent providing volunteer services. The findings indicated that three of the four human capital variables (physical functioning, psychological adjustment, and social resources) were statistically related to the elderly's becoming volunteers. Findings also indicated that the fourth human capital variable, perceived health, was a significant predictor of the amount of time elderly volunteers spent in providing services. (NB)",

Quiz questions represented the subjects' favorite and the confederates' ostensive least favorite category. Having memorized the answers, confederates either decisively won or lost. Following the contest, subjects and confederates were directed to an adjoining room to sit on a  bench. Subjects sat closer to and better liked the prettier confederate.

Chapter 4 explains loss ratio and presents findings that loss ratio  experience of Medigap policies is mixed and generally not used by states to evaluate premiums. Chapter 5 examines federal and state efforts to curb sales abuse through education and penalties. Because the report found that Section 1882, when combined with state efforts, appeared to be meeting its objectives of protecting the elderly against substandard Medigap policies and providing them with information on how to select Medigap policies, no recommendations for change are included. Four tables and one figure are included; Company-Wide Loss Ratio Experience for Medicare Supplemental Insurance is appended. (NB)",

Subjects were elderly psychiatric patients (N=46) referred to a geriatric assessment unit and their caregivers (N=46). Patients completed measures of cognitive status, depression, and self-reported ability to perform basic activities of daily living (walking, eating) and instrumental activities of daily living (doing laundry, talking on the telephone). Caregivers completed measures of patient disruptive behavior, caregiver distress, and caregiver burden.  The results revealed that significant predictors of caregiver burden were patient disruptive behavior, patient activities of daily living limitation, patient memory or orientation, and caregiver distress.

However, the act permits employers to impose a specific retirement age if there is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) which cannot be met by all or most individuals. Imposition of BFOQ mandatory retirement ages by employers has led to litigation. Many of these cases concern whether there are age-related changes in behavior that impair job abilities beyond a certain age. In virtually all job classifications questions of intellectual competence, judgment, and motivation are involved. Psychologists may be called as expert witnesses about these competency issues. Psychologists as expert witnesses provide expert testimony and relevant research literature, educate the  attorney on methodological issues, and help prepare the attorney for trial. Job skills needed should be analyzed and the effects of age on their performance assessed. When an employer attempts to support the BFOQ defense through use of an industrial psychologist and his literature analysis, the expert trained in the aging field should look for research flaws such as inappropriate reliance on cross-sectional or group difference data, absolute magnitude of age changes, and compensation of age changes in skilled behaviors. To combat the argument that it is possible to test for individual characteristics of the job, the expert may need to identify objective assessment procedures which are age-neutral. (ABL)",

The first section presents the panel's recommendations for teachers; namely, that they renew the emphasis on phonics and reading aloud in the classroom and sharply cut the time spent on workbook activities, replacing it with independent reading time. The second section asserts the importance of parents in laying the foundation for their children's reading abilities and suggests  various ways that parents can help their children achieve these skills, including reading aloud to children, discussing stories by asking thought-provoking questions, and encouraging independent reading. The final section presents the panel's conclusion that those who produce textbooks rely too heavily on readability formulas and should, instead, take into consideration clarity, organization, interest, literary quality, and accuracy.

Findings indicated that most RDRs (1) required the following background information: personal data, clinician's name, educational history, reason for referral, student interests and attitudes, and a listing of tests administered; (2) included assessment data pertaining to such areas as comprehension, reading attitude/interest, and reading vocabulary; (3) provided some type of interpretation of the assessment; (4) provided suggestions to  parents such as activities for encouraging reading at home; and (5) proposed a variety of intervention strategies for teachers. The most noticeable trend identified in RDRs was the movement toward simplicity: the tendency is for reports to be shorter, less complex, and written in language that most parents and educators can understand. Results also revealed a movement toward informal assessment procedures that concentrate more on process information than product and that include the assessment of affective dimensions. Results suggested that reading tests constitute useful tools for validating the progress and reliability of developmental and remedial holistic reading programs. (JD)",

Related factors found to affect the reading performance of students included mother's level of education, amount of  household income, and early education. Specifically, assessment results indicated that (1) more than half of the students reported their mothers worked outside the home; (2) students with mothers working outside the home performed better in reading, possibly due to the relationship between mothers who work outside the home and traditional socioeconomic advantages, for example, higher education and income; (3) mothers who work outside the home have higher levels of education and students whose parents have more education achieve higher reading scores; and (4) more students whose mothers work outside the home attended nursery school, which is associated with better reading performance.

This conclusion represents one segment of the findings of the 1983-84 National Assessment, which focused on reading and writing and was administered to approximately 100,000 students across 30 states. Specifically, students were asked how much time they spent on homework yesterday. Findings showed that almost two-thirds of the students reported spending time on homework, with little variance among racial/ethnic groups. This finding seemed related to more homework being assigned and reflected an increase as compared to 1980 NAEP results. Students who received homework assignments and did them tended  to read at higher proficiency levels than students who did not have homework or who did not complete assigned work. Results showed that the more time students spent on homework assigned, the better they read; this relationship was clearest at grade 11. Seventy percent of the students who spent more than two hours on homework were found to watch two hours or less of television. Based on these results, NAEP recommended that: (1) students need parental support to complete assignments, (2) teachers and parents should set clear goals for homework assignments, and (3) homework policies should be consistent with other school goals.

A series of five varied studies evaluated these strategies for vocabulary acquisition. All verified that these strategies are not only powerful tools for vocabulary development but good alternatives to the traditional instructional activities presented before students read a new passage (pre-reading). In this latter application, semantic mapping and feature analysis serve not only to introduce key vocabulary from a passage but also to activate students' prior knowledge of a topic, thereby  better preparing students to understand, assimilate, and evaluate the information in the material to be read. In addition, when used after reading a new passage (postreading), semantic based instructional strategies provide a review of the material that anchors new knowledge to prior knowledge. In a secondary focus of the research project to determine the role of vocabulary instruction in actual classroom practice, a field survey of teachers was conducted. Results indicate that vocabulary instruction and emphasis are not high priorities with most classroom teachers. (NKA)",

The study reviewed existing literature to learn why this is so, and also to determine if direct daily newspaper competition affects content. A randomly stratified (for ownership and competition) sample of ll4 newspapers was chosen during November l984. Only news and editorial sections were analyzed. The initial hypothesis, that newspaper content is determined by more than one allocation process, was tested with factor analysis. Twenty-one content measures were factor analyzed to see if they grouped in the news space allocation, editorial space allocation, and  budget allocation processes. The second hypothesis, that daily newspaper content is affected by direct newspaper competition, was tested using regression analysis for each of the 2l content variables. The final hypothesis concerned whether intensity of competition provides a more accurate measure of the impact of competition on content than does a categorical measure. Results indicate that competition does have an impact on daily newspaper content, whether for better or worse is unclear. (Statistical data are appended.) (NKA)",

Several legislative requirements are presented, though it is emphasized that school districts can either adopt these objectives or develop a different set, provided that it remains consistent with state goals. An overview of language arts education is provided as a basis for the presentation of six state educational goals. The goals presented stipulate that students, as a result of their schooling, will be able to (1) read,  comprehend, interpret, evaluate, and use written materials; (2) listen critically and analytically; (3) write standard English in a grammatical, well organized, and coherent manner for a variety of purposes; (4) use spoken language effectively in formal and informal situations to communicate ideas and information and to ask and answer questions; (5) understand the various forms of significant literature representing different cultures, eras, and ideas; and (6) understand how and why language functions and evolves. For each of the six goals a list of general knowledge skills related to a specific goal is provided. Sample learning objectives, keyed to the general knowledge/skills are then provided for each of the six goals and for each of the five grades.

The essay, which focuses on how these course tasks coincide with the findings of recent reading research, defines critical reading and applies the definition to the problem of American teenagers' critical reading of literature, citing findings and suggestions from the works cited. The paper also addresses the benefits of the in-depth study of a significant literary work to students' understanding and enjoyment of the reading. The appendixes comprise the bulk of the document and prescribe class activities designed to  complement and enrich students' reading of Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell to Arms.&quot; Appendix 1 lists 20 tasks that students must complete in the term; the remaining appendixes spring from these requirements. Appendix 2 provides study questions--to be answered after the first complete reading--that solicit analytical paragraphs about the reading. Appendix 3 requires students to form a thesis statement from a list of specific passages, Appendix 4 contains a sample of a final essay based on this statement, Appendix 5 provides a sample page from a background project assignment list, and Appendix 6 lists bibliographical materials for students.

The second part of the report consists of five workshop handouts about the following topics: (1) prepositional phrases, compounding, and ellipsis; (2) the four variations of the basic sentence pattern; (3) subordinate clauses; (4) gerunds and gerundives; and (5) appositives. Also presented in the second part is a sequential studies done by John Mellon and Frank O'Hare in 1969 and 1973. The second part of the report consists of five curriculum for grades 3 through 12 outlining the skills and concepts to be learned at each stage of  a child's development. The final section of the paper reports on a study, the results of which indicated a connection between knowledge of grammar and students' ability to write when the method used to teach grammar is geared to improving writing skills. The report concludes that results of pretests and posttests involving revising a passage of writing support the assertion that the method used to teach grammar can affect students' ability to write.

This computer system will generate many more newscasts and provide news to a greater variety of outlets than are available today. Television newsrooms in 2001 will be high-tech centers, filled with games and gadgets, where technology will replace almost all human effort except communication (as in editing and creating the newscast). Other innovations in the communications industry will be high definition TV, some form of home TV alphanumerics teletext, videotex, or both, cable as a nearly  equal partner in the national media mix, investment of network money in cable broadcasting, direct broadcasting by satellite, and a more global outlook for local TV news. Data and video will be moving around the world via the telephone company's fiber optics.

Research indicates that large numbers of raters can be trained in the use of these scales and that, during training and independent rating, they can maintain high levels of agreement. The expository scale employs five elements to assess students' expository writing: general competence, essay organization and coherence, paragraph coherence, support, and grammar/mechanics. The narrative scale employs four elements to assess students' narrative writing: general competence, focus and organization, support, and grammar/mechanics. Each scale is (1) firmly anchored in research on  writing and writing assessment, (2) intended for use in a setting in which students are provided with clear writing prompts containing explicit directions to help them to plan and develop their assignment, and (3) is numerically rated to assess specific criteria and examples of skill levels and deficient levels. Each scale also represents instructional priorities of the school system using the scales. CSE plans the training of raters carefully to ensure reliability in the scoring procedures.

It was hypothesized that children using the devices would write longer stories, edit more, and produce higher quality stories than children not receiving feedback from a speech synthesizer. Subjects were 48 children, three girls and three boys each drawn from two second grade and two fifth grade classrooms in two different schools. Subjects from one second grade and one fifth grade classroom at each school wrote one story under the spoken feedback condition and then two stories under the nonspoken condition. Experimental conditions were reversed for the other two classrooms. Results showed that using a speech synthesizer led to increased levels of editing in young  children. In addition, preference for the spoken feedback was negatively related to story length for both second and fifth grade students, to audience awareness for second grade students, and to story level editing for fifth grade students, indicating that less-skilled writers were the most motivated by hearing spoken feedback.

        "description":"Careful audience analysis should be a major focus of the rhetorical side of technical writing courses for university undergraduates. Student writers need to be taught to appreciate their readers' problems, interests, and motives. Most often, audience analysis is accomplished imaginatively--authors create mental images of their readers. Students can learn this by writing a short paper for an expert audience (defined by the student) about some problem, development, or new knowledge in their major field. Students are grouped by discipline and asked to imagine themselves as the intended readers while they respond to early drafts of these specialist papers. The result of these audience role playing sessions is that the authors get a sense of what a knowledgeable professional or expert  audience can be expected to know, and what level of discourse is appropriate. They also learn how to demonstrate their competence to both fellow experts and their superiors through an executive review, for which authors present the essential findings of the specialist paper in a three-minute extemporaneous speech followed by five minutes of questions. Through these activities, many students learn about professional responsibility and realize how documents can function as more than vehicles for the exchange of information. (SRT)",

Overall statistical results generated through hypothesis testing indicated that these factors were relatively important predictors of VCR penetration in industrialized and less industrialized countries. Specifically, findings indicated that (1) the level of gross national product (GNP) per capita provides the economic basis for VCR diffusion; (2) national TV systems with greater structural and programing freedom, but without a multichannel environment, may encourage more rapid VCR penetration; (3) the number of TV sets available to a population  correlates positively with the level of VCR diffusion; (4) although newspaper circulation and telephone penetration are significantly related to VCR penetration, these correlations are largely a function of GNP per capita; and (5) radio use and movie attendance are relatively independent from the acquisition of VCRs because VCR use relies more heavily on TV penetration and its related variables. Results suggested that VCRs may penetrate TV households across nations more rapidly than any other electronic medium in the history of telecommunications.

Crises in the national economic situation will continue to have an impact on the humanities in the form of public disinterest and a lack of funding by private organizations. To face these obstacles, administrators must make do with available financial resources while seeking new sources of support. In response to declining enrollments due to general economic conditions and rising tuition costs, administrators must advocate maintaining high academic standards and must focus on meeting the needs of the substantial number of older students. The public's perception that teachers are not as  valuable as they once were has resulted in a decrease in the funds available to educators in general, the demoralization of many faculties, and increased antipathy among disciplines. Administrators can improve the prospects for the humanities in the next decade by developing a strong, professional faculty and a high quality of education for students. In practical terms, they must make sure that everyday activities run as smoothly, efficiently, and equitably as possible, and they should set an example of strong leadership for both faculty and students.

        "description":"An upper school English program has been experimenting with ways to reinforce its traditional literary curriculum with contemporary works. Three contemporary novels in particular (Naylor's \"The Women of Brewster Place,\" Walker's \"The Color Purple,\" and Miller's \"A Canticle for Leibowitz\") have been found to foster a sense of continuity with the enduring works which populate the classical, British, and American traditions. The contemporary fiction is incorporated into the program in such a way as to deepen students' appreciation of the demanding themes and evolving fictional, dramatic, and poetic forms they have already encountered. Each recent work represents a unique and \"modern\" approach to an ages-old theme; each takes its place within a centuries-old tradition of genre, or of  narrative technique. The Naylor book paints the lives of a group of working, oppressed black women who have migrated to a rundown area of the city. They form a composite portrait of a community of neglected women, and serve as a poignant modern counterpoint to the variegated band of pilgrims Chaucer draws with such subtlety. \"The Color Purple\" is an epistolary novel and so fits nicely into a curriculum that includes \"Pamela\" and \"Pride and Prejudice.\" Miller's evocation of a postnuclear future, when in effect the world returns to the barbarian and primitive system that marked the early Middle Ages is a superb introduction to that era for students in this program.

Results suggested that writing in the elementary classroom is a dynamic  and whole language cognitive process in which reading, listening, and speaking contribute to students' writing.

The potential for conflict is thus present. According to L. Althusser, however, the state provides certain apparatuses that prevent the formation of radically different ideologies, one of which is literature, which creates the reader, the subject. For J. Derrida, on the other hand, an ideology is a logical system, a structure, that is centered on one term of an opposition (such as good-evil) and functions only by ignoring the ennobling power of the other term. F. de Saussure considers language not a system but discourse. If an English teacher regards language as a system that stands  outside the speaking subject, then the appropriate mode of instruction would involve drill, correction, and testing. If language is discourse, then the appropriate mode of instruction would involve establishing the class as a discourse community in which all members interact, creating the course and competency through constant practice. A classroom that is a safe place to challenge various beliefs and ideologies prepares students for a world that will often set their values or beliefs in question. (NKA)",

Their stories then become the context for an introduction to literary terminology such as point of view, setting, and use of dialogue versus narration. Having just written their own stories, students know that these terms designate real decisions and they see that these choices affect how, as readers, they now understand the stories. For the second assignment, students write a one-page analysis of their own stories in which they discuss their own work in the third person, showing how narrative technique, characterization, setting, dialogue, and plot structure all contribute to the story's impact. This forces them to recognize the dual  role of their writing as at once something they did and the object of someone else's perception. The third assignment is a more formal, graded essay analyzing one story in their anthology from the standpoint of a single issue. With this assignment they realize how creative analysis is an act of complicity and cooperation between author and reader, not the passive appreciation of another's greatness. Teaching composition and literature appreciation simultaneously encourages inventiveness in both. (SRT)",

        "description":"Detailing the false starts, uncertainty, and internal questioning that occur as companies organize and manage language simplification projects, the 12 case studies contained in the two sections of this book reveal how some business organizations have benefited by simplifying consumer documents. Descriptions of each case contain information on the background and payoffs of the project, and materials available. The resulting plain English products are said to improve each company's image and competitive position as well as streamline procedures, eliminate unnecessary forms, and reduce customer complaints. The first section details the approaches of the following corporations to assigning responsibility, gathering data, using in-house talent or consultants, and testing materials:  (1) Citibank, N. A.; (2) Home Owners Warranty Corporation; (3) J. C. Penny Company, Inc.; (4) Pfizer, Inc.; (5) Roche Laboratories/Hoffman-LaRoche Inc.; (6) Shell Oil Company; and (7) Target Stores. The second section describes simplification projects initiated by four insurance organization that were among the pioneers in the movement to simplify insurance policies in the 1970s: Aetna Life & Casualty, American Council of Life Insurance, Insurance Information Institute, Sentry Insurance, and St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company. An explanation of Flesch Reading East Test is appended, as is a checklist for organizing and managing a corporate plain English project. (JD)",

The School Academic Competition Inventory provides a way to determine the potential for such a program. If the potential exists, school leaders must determine (1) the event's main focus--an interdisciplinary emphasis would have the greatest overall impact; (2) the kinds of academic achievement to be emphasized--focusing on general problem-solving skills would allow students to demonstrate their abilities to apply their academic knowledge in various situations; (3) whether individual or team achievement will be emphasized and what skill qualifications will be  required to compete; (4) who will control the event--building up a coalition of sponsors would allow schools to develop their own competitions; and (5) the awards and judges. If a school decides to develop a competition on its own, organizers should become familiar with and incorporate suitable features of some of the existing models for competitions, such as the Academic Olympiad (which has recently been successfully applied at Utah State University), the Wise County (Virginia) Program of Academic Challenge for Excellence, and the Kentucky Academic Association.

Students can benefit from class projects assisted by a librarian. By reviewing such sources as \"Children's Catalog\" and \"The Horn Book,\" the librarian can assemble a selection of books from various genres addressing different aspects of  the subject being studied. The class should be consulted for ideas. Biographical information on the authors can be provided.

The paper is written in the form of exerpts from relevant conversations. The first conversation relates how the idea was introduced to all the teachers by a team comprised of teachers from all subject areas, and how the idea of school-wide journal keeping was explained to teachers meeting in smaller groups. The second conversation reveals how teachers used response journals in the classroom to reinforce what students had learned during the class period. The third conversation explains how students could use their journals to annotate and relate their  learning by writing summary paragraphs speculating on what their learning will mean to them at a later time. The paper concludes that because of the program all the students at the school are writing, even those whose grasp of English is only tenuous, and students' reading comprehension has improved.

        "description":"A study of over 200 personal narratives, in which college freshman writers related their experiences of achieving literacy, offered insights into cultural differences in attitudes toward literacy. The activity of becoming literate was fundamentally the same for males and females, but the myths they used to understand and explain their experiences at each stage of the process were different. Males' experiences reinforced a myth of literacy for autonomy and females' experiences reinforced a myth of literacy for participation. In analyzing the personal narratives, it became clear that the gender of the reader was as significant as the gender of the writer. An experiment with graduate student teachers indicated that when a female read the narratives, it was more likely to be scored  high if it was representative of the autonomy myth and if she had attributed it to a male. When a male read the narratives, he assigned higher scores to narratives he attributed to women, but showed only a slight preference for the narratives that fit the female participation myth paradigm. Experience may have taught women, both as writers and readers, that identification with male values and traits will enhance their chances for academic success. Students of both sexes need to be taught to balance the demands of both participation and autonomy. (SRT)",

        "description":"Composing written text in an educational context engages both students and teachers in struggles between convention and choice, resulting frequently in the negotiation of compromises with which neither teachers nor students feel comfortable. The linguistic traditions of a discipline are powerful determinants of the nature of the language in which students are expected to conceptualize the evidence of the discipline, and to express their concepts in written text. Students learn discipline-specific linguistic conventions that are conceptual frames for intuited, personal, or common sense responses. This changes what is signified by the language, shifting it from the realm of personal or even common knowledge into the more rarefied and authorized realm of discipline-specific  knowledge. At the same time it allows for an integration between what is authorized and what is intuited, between convention and choice. If the relationship between convention and choice can be viewed dialectically, the tension between them can be a struggle toward linguistic growth. Examples from students show that conventions are frequently perceived by students and teachers alike as constraints. To make academic language more accessible to students, teachers should evaluate their linguistic conventions and discard those that no longer serve a useful purpose. (SRT)",

        "description":"Feminist literary criticism seems to have the potential to bring new life to old standards taught in the high school English class even if the students are not themselves feminists. A feminist approach to literature instruction was first attempted using &quot;This Is Just to Say&quot; and &quot;The Young Housewife&quot; by William Carlos Williams without having his name attached to the poems. The students discussed whether the poem's voice was masculine or feminine. The next effort at infusing feminist criticism into the classroom used Andrew Marvell's &quot;To His Coy Mistress,&quot; Margaret Atwood's &quot;There Must Be More for You to Do&quot; and other poetry that tackled traditional archetypes of men and women. Current efforts to use feminist criticism involved Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; which focused on  the elements of language and artistry as well as the influence of feminist criticism. The goal was to provide students with a clearly articulated feminist position on the play, beginning with the idea that this is not merely ill-fated, star-crossed love. While feminist literary criticism is promising for high school literature instruction, the form that it should take is an intriguing challenge in lesson design and refinement. (SRT)",

They must work 225 hours at the station and keep a diary listing actual hours worked and duties performed. At the end of the internship, students must write a 3-5 page evaluation of the semester, turn in samples of creative work, submit a supervisor's evaluation of themselves, take a test over the required reading for the course, and submit photocopied proof that they obtained an FCC Third Class license with Broadcast Endorsement. Evaluation and  grading of the students is best done by accumulating as much written evidence as possible such as the diary and a synthesizing paper reviewing the relationship between theory and practice in broadcasting.

Through an analysis of the prevalence of programs in six genres, these hypotheses were supported. Results indicated that programmers are more likely to air shows of a given genre in years immediately following a year in which there was a highly rated program of that genre. Strongest support for the hypotheses was found in prediction of the number of programs of each type returning to the air. The study concluded that the audience does influence the content and variety of programming offered by networks.

The Measure of Relational Competence, along with individual self-reports for empathy, role taking, and self-monitoring, were administered for 36 conversations among female college students. Results indicated that, in the context of initial acquaintance between women, individual tendencies explain some stable effects in impressions of competence. Unique adjustments to the relationship seem limited to projection from one's own competence to the other and to accurate self-perception of competence in each dyad. Little relational adjustment between individuals occurs in such dyads. In this  context, actors' impressions of partners' competence are predicted by the partners' individual characteristics, but also are affected by the actors' self-perceptions as adjusted to each interaction.

The classic model of the adoption process expects that knowledge about a subject will lead to a favorable evaluation of it, which in turn will lead to a decision to act. But the decision to help a sick person with a mysterious disease is difficult. Fifty-three students enrolled in two sections of a basic speech communication course responded to a survey measuring image, knowledge, and behavioral intent about three diseases: AIDS, Toxic Shock Syndrome, and Legionnaire's Disease. Results suggest that the communication configuration of AIDS is different from the configuration of other diseases in the respect that as  knowledge about AIDS increases, the stigma of AIDS increases. If this is so, then the task of moderating hysteria and panic through an educational campaign will fail. Under these circumstances, it might be appropriate to aim at getting individuals involved in help projects prior to educational efforts, so that through the act of helping, selective attention and perception may work to promote a more favorable image of and a tolerance for the facts about AIDS.

        "description":"A study analyzed the features of nonstandard English spoken on television during the hours when children are most likely to be watching. A grammatical analysis of the speech of 150 television characters revealed that, in general, television presented a homogenized version of nonstandard English. The relative frequency of usage of nonstandard English was highest among males and blacks, depending on the role they portrayed. Although black characters were found to have the highest incidence of variants per person on television, their speech contained few features characteristic to black English, as described by Labov and Burling. The results suggest that nonstandard English may essentially be a device used for stereotyping television characters into categories of the power  assertive, the comedian, and/or the victim.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between television viewing habits and reading achievement of students in grades 4, 8, and 11. Students, in addition to responding to the achievement and background exercises, answered three questions about their television viewing habits. Analysis of results showed that at all three grade levels, students who watched television six hours or more were much poorer readers than those who watched less. At grade 11, students who watched television two hours or less each day were better readers than those who watched three to five hours. This pattern follows at grades 4 and 8, although the differences were not as great. Results also indicated that the negative relationship between excessive television watching and reading performance is worst for white  students and for students with well-educated parents. These results suggest that parents should modify their own television viewing behavior, monitor their children's television viewing, teach children to make intelligent choices, watch with their children, and advocate more responsible television programming. Educators should teach parents about the negative effects of television viewing, teach children how to evaluate what they see, incorporate excellent programs into instruction, and develop and suggest more positive after-school activities.

        "description":"A study explored ways of improving satisfying and dissatisfying conversations in order to have more effective interethnic communication. Specifically, research questions based in accommodation theory addressed what blacks feel could be done to improve both successful and unsuccessful conversations with whites. Twenty-four undergraduates at a Southwestern university completed a questionnaire for which they recalled satisfying and dissatisfying conversations with a white person and provided demographic information. Analysis produced five categories of alignment strategies: (1) asserting a point of view, (2) open mindedness, (3) lack of resolution, (4) interaction management, and (5) other orientation. Interaction management and other orientation were seen as strategies for  improving already satisfying interactions while the remaining strategies were used to align dissatisfying interactions. In general, results showed that to promote alignment, respondents felt that the self should become more assertive about the topic, the other person should become more open-minded, and the conversation should be managed more smoothly through interaction management. Given the accommodation difficulties of interethnic communication, alignment strategies are important for effective interethnic relationships. Further research should test the efficacy of strategies suggested by participants in this study.A three-page reference list concludes the document. (SRT)",

The mistakes can be summarized as acquiescing to the traditional female role, resisting traditional socialization and internalizing masculine characteristics, and over-emphasizing both the differences between women and men and the discrimination in the university. Respondents offered the following advice: (1) be androgynous or behaviorally flexible; (2) do your job, particularly in the area of research and writing; (3) be self-motivated, develop an internal locus of control, or look to yourself rather than to others for your success; and (4) gain the support of other  people.

        "description":"Graduate programs in speech communication offer students a variety of assistantships including a forensic assistantship. Among factors affecting assistantships that have not been investigated in past studies, three stand out. The first factor that should be considered is the size of the entire graduate program in the department. The nature of a forensic assistantship often depends on the size of the school. In many cases, the communication graduate program is small and the only graduate students are those directly involved in the forensic program. The second factor is the employment of a graduate student as the director of forensics. Many schools plead a tight budget and use this as an excuse not to fund a director's position and staff it with regular faculty. The third factor  that needs attention is found in the priorities of graduate assistants. For various reasons, students often make their assistantship the first priority, at the expense of their academic studies. The system of using graduate students as assistants in the forensic program can be improved, and investigations into how to improve it should continue. (SRT)",

        "description":"The current condition of educational finance in Ontario and the factors influencing efforts at finance reform are examined in this report. Five key issues confronting school finance in Ontario are reviewed first: inequities caused by variations in district wealth; the failure of provincial support to keep pace with expenditures; the loss of efficiency due to the rapid rise in expenditures; the need to fund upper grades in Catholic separate schools; and the fiscal autonomy of school boards. Four options for financing education are examined next: adapting the current &quot;mill rate equalization&quot; grant plan to accommodate the Catholic schools; maintaining the current plan but with revised weighting of students; instituting a foundation grant plan with a variable foundation level; and  adopting a resource cost model for funding on a program basis. The report then presents scenarios exploring how four different systems for organizing the schools would interact with each of the financing models in light of the key issues noted earlier. The organizational systems examined are structured with varying emphases on differences in students' language, religion, and grade level. The report concludes with a prediction about the combination of organizational structure and financing method most likely to be adopted. (PGD)",

In the process, the local school establishes a leadership team to manage school improvement, collects data on student performance, uses the data to determine a high priority improvement goal, selects and implements practices that research has shown can help to meet the goal, and monitors progress toward goal achievement. Following its establishment of a leadership team and its assessment of needs based on student performance data and teachers' perceptions of problem areas, Centennial established as its two major goals a 50 percent reduction in attendance problems and 10 percent  increases in achievement test scores, enrollments in advanced classes, percentages of time on task, and success rates on tests and assignments. This report describes the specific steps taken at Centennial, the use of inservice training in the program, the extent of teacher participation, the school's success in reaching the stated goals, and the school's continuing efforts at improvement.

One effort focuses on achieving articulation of the curriculum throughout the district's four elementary schools, middle school, and high school. A needs assessment survey revealed that even within individual schools teachers were not utilizing a unified scope and sequence of instruction. In May 1984 a districtwide Reading Subject Review Committee was established to make recommendations in reading instruction, the first area to be improved. The district's other major improvement effort involved implementing a local-school-oriented process developed by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. This model for school improvement incorporates collecting  data on student performance, setting goals on the basis of these data, and selecting and implementing research-based effective schooling practices to meet the goals. Following training of administrators and selection of the individual schools' improvement teams, each school established its own goals and implemented improvement strategies. Despite fiscal difficulties, the district's improvement program has resulted in increased awareness and a commitment to continued effort. (PGD)",

The discipline policy features new attendance rules, a new code of conduct, the use of inschool suspensions, and a vandalism prevention program. After years with a reputation for student misbehavior, McKnight now has the lowest suspension rate in the district and vandalism costs have been cut substantially. The study skills program includes schoolwide formats for assignments, rules for keeping school notebooks organized, and training in listening, note-taking,  reading, and writing skills. Curricular improvements include block teaching of social studies and language arts, a reading program, and a special math program placing students by individual achievement level. Recognition is provided through awards assemblies, special honors for students completing assignments, and broadcast acknowledgment of special efforts by students or staff members. District support for faculty development and the growth of a strong parents' group have also aided school improvement.

        "description":"This paper posits guidelines for planners forming interorganizational arrangements--or collaboratives--among universities, businesses, community organizations, and schools. The paper hypothesizes that schools can benefit from collaboratives and that these partnerships' success is attendant upon mutual understanding of a collaborative focus. Principles of collaboration were originally identified through a longitudinal study of a doctoral program arrangement between five county school systems and the University of Maryland. Additional research results were incorporated into the emerging model. Interorganizational relationships are newly created, single organizations formed voluntarily to achieve an interdependency of formal collaboration. This model features relationships among  four characteristics: (1) Environmental, (2) Relational, (3) Procedural, and (4) Structural. Environmental characteristics involve organizations entering the arrangement and the external influences upon operations. Relational characteristics include properties that describe relationships, for example, involvement by member organizations' representatives. Shared decisionmaking defines the collaborative focus. Procedural characteristics concern formality, exchange process, and administrative processes. Organizations' equitable exchange of goods and services is central to collaboration. Structural characteristics are features of member organizations, collaborative demography, resources, and coordination mechanisms. Implementation of sponsored programs is the least developed aspect of the  model at this time. Public organizations are favoring collaborative management principles because organizational settings now approximate settings of the interorganizational arrangements. (CJH)",

These equality provisions were deferred for a 3-year period so that federal, provincial, and territorial governments could inspect their legislation, consider and consult about the effect of the provisions on their governmental policies and practices, and legislate necessary amendments. This paper identifies and discusses provincial considerations of educational policy and practice in the equality provisions in general and of section 15 in particular. Part 1 reviews the legislative history of section 15. Part 2 discusses various  mechanisms employed by different governments for reviewing statutory enactments. Part 3 concludes with reports on what amendments were made and what measures were taken by the different governments and private interest organizations in revising, reformulating, and abrogating inequitable and offensive legislative provisions and policies. Evidence shows that the federal and provincial/territorial governments generally have adopted a narrow, limited, technical, and superficial approach to the task of harmonizing their legislation with the equality standards in section 15 of the Charter.

        "description":"This monograph guides administrators in developing policies that lead to improved supervision of instruction. Chapter 1, &quot;The Mystery of Effective Teaching,&quot; by Barbara Benham Tye, focuses on improving schools' work environment through the supportive methods of clinical supervision. Arthur L. Costa describes five phases of the process between supervisor and teacher in the second chapter, &quot;Clinical Supervision--A Definition.&quot;&quot;Reviewing the Difference between Supervision and Evaluation,&quot; chapter 3, by Arthur L. Costa and Robert Garmston, distinguishes nine processes in which supervision and evaluation are performed differently. Chapter 4, also by Costa and Garmston, discusses assumptions and goals in &quot;Cognitive Coaching--Supervision for Intelligent Teaching.&quot; Michelle Williams  relates personal experiences in chapter 5, &quot;Peer Coaching Improved My Teaching,&quot; by describing advantages of the model. &quot;The Role of the Principal as Instructional Leader,&quot; by Kenneth A. Tye, chapter 6, surveys demands placed upon principals and recommends new types of training programs. The final chapter, &quot;The Role of the School Board: Linking the Professional and Political Worlds of Clinical Supervision,&quot; by Richard C. Williams, recommends that teacher supervision involve teachers in procedures; as political bodies, boards must acquaint themselves with teaching procedures as well. A bibliography provides 25 references. (CJH)",

        "description":"The role of the professional evaluator within a school district is essentially to provide data for use in informed decision making. In School District 4J in Eugene, Oregon, this role involves performing tasks in three basic categories: (1) maintaining and interpreting ongoing databases, (2) finding and analyzing information to answer specific administrative questions, and (3) assisting with the district's cycle of program evaluation. The ongoing databases, distinct from the district's mainframe computer records, provide information for enrollment projection, high school subject area enrollment trends, and longitudinal analysis of standardized test results. Requests for special-purpose information can lead to quick responses or require major reports. Typical requests have sought  information on the potential impact of changes in graduation requirements, on predictors of the tendency to drop out of school, on the effects of an open enrollment policy, and on space utilization in an elementary school. The district's subject area programs are evaluated every 6 years, with the evaluator assisting in evaluation design and gathering and summarizing information for the subject area council. As purveyors of data, the evaluators collaborate with other educators in the evaluation process, promoting cooperative and productive decision making. (PGD)",

This brochure describes Pennsylvania's Partnerships in Education program, an outgrowth of earlier &quot;adopt-a-school&quot; efforts and a component of Governor Dick Thornburgh's comprehensive reform package. Students benefit by translating learning into the world of work; partners benefit by contributing to the education of their future work force. Partnerships flourish on every scale. Some involve entire school districts and hundreds of students and employees; others pair private partners with a single class or with individual students. Partnerships exist in urban industrial areas and rural regions alike. This brochure provides a representative sample of some of the  2,500 cooperative agreements throughout the state. Each example cited includes a short description and identifies the partners and someone to contact. Programs range from high school journalism and construction projects to a &quot;Generations Together&quot; program involving senior citizens and elementary school children. Another section highlights cooperative ventures between schools and state government agencies. The brochure closes with suggestions for starting partnerships and a list of state agencies to contact for more information. (MLH)",

Primary research objectives were (1) to expand knowledge on the nature of administrative control, (2) to develop a better understanding of the processes and activities in effective school districts, and (3) to study the role of the superintendent in providing leadership in coordinating district and school activities and in promoting effectiveness. Other objectives were to examine differences among patterns of control uncovered in these effective districts and in studies of other school districts, as well as to compare types of control used across districts within the sample. Issues studied included the following: the hiring of new  principals from within and from outside the district; the use of formal administrator internship programs; factors superintendents look for in hiring principals; supervision and evaluation of principals; school visitation by superintendents; principal participation in staff development programs; rewards and sanctions; goals; resource allocation; behavior control and monitoring; and technological specifications. The paper concludes with a discussion of patterns and themes that emerged from the study. Appended are 1 figure, 1 table, 13 notes, and 5 pages of references. (IW)",

        "description":"Most systems of administrative control include both formal and informal, explicit and implicit evaluative mechanisms that sense deviation from standards and activate corrective actions to return subordinates to acceptable levels of performance or to correct beliefs. A review of prior studies showed, however, that few school districts have specific standards against which they assess principal performance and outputs. This paper describes a study aimed at correcting some of these deficiencies (1) by employing the Natriello and Dornbusch conceptual model of evaluation, which identifies clearly delineated evaluation stages of allocating tasks, setting criteria, sampling performance and/or outputs, and appraising; (2) by examining all stages in the evaluation process, and (3) by  gathering information from both superintendents and principals. A questionnaire sent to a random sample of 200 principals and to all 142 superintendents in a southern state yielded 149 usable returns from principals (74%) and 121 usable returns from superintendents (85%). Results showed that (1) the evaluation system is perceived to be specific and clear in task allocations; (2) a level of uncertainty exists regarding criteria setting; and (3) principals and superintendents disagree on how performance and outputs are sampled. More adequate communication between superintendents and principals is needed. Appended are two pages of references, two tables, and one figure. (IW)",

        "description":"A suspension school for secondary students, established in the 1977-78 school year in an Arkansas school district has developed specific program goals and procedures. Following a discussion of the school's origins, this paper describes operating procedures, philosophy, support system, and student reaction. Suspensions declined considerably through the 1982-83 school year; they have increased somewhat since then but the size of the district has also steadily increased. A student's \"sentence\" at the school is determined by the principal. Individual programs are planned around school hours. After the student attends the minimum days required, a conference by student, parents, and principal reviews the student progress and decides if the student is ready to return to regular classes.  Personnel strive for goals that include serving educational needs, providing a secure home base, promoting discipline, building positive self-image, and guiding students toward responsibility. In the view of school administrators, community support is a primary need in a suspension school program, and should involve a variety of organizations committed to serving local youth. Support from school organizations, personnel, and parents prevents the school from becoming isolated. Most students at the school face what they consider to be reasonable punishment and complete their assignments. The likelihood of a student returning once again is about one in four: the prospect of more returns diminishes rapidly thereafter. (CJH)",

Vacancy announcements are rarely publicized widely and those charged with making selections are frequently unaware of the qualifications pertinent to the position being filled. Teachers most likely to move up the career ladder into administrative positions are those who call attention to themselves by accepting responsibilities outside the classroom and then pursue formal administrative training. Districts working to improve their principal selection processes tend to recruit  candidates, actively develop potential principals, write job descriptions specific to each position, and rely less heavily than other districts on the superintendent's judgments. In addition to reviewing the findings of the research project, this report notes where further information can be obtained. (PGD)",

These conclusions were drawn following a survey of 32 school districts across the nation with highly developed teacher evaluation programs, and after further, intensive study of four of the most advanced districts: Salt Lake City, Utah; Lake Washington, Washington; Greenwich, Connecticut; and Toledo, Ohio. The four systems differed, but were similar in sharing the traits found to be common in successful programs. It was concluded  that five factors were critical to the development of an effective program: (1) the teacher evaluation system must suit the educational goals, management style, and community values of the school district; (2) the district must be willing to commit time and money to evaluation; (3) the district must establish the goals for its program and design the program accordingly; (4) the program must be useful to the district, to the school community, and to the community at large; and (5) teachers must be involved and given responsibility.

The respondents were not willing to support these reforms if they were paid for by closing schools or by eliminating existing extracurricular programs, but indicated that they would be willing to pay higher taxes to implement the new standards. Fewer than half of the respondents favored lengthening the school year or the school day. Those surveyed also favored requiring teachers to pass state or national tests and to participate in professional development activities during the summer. Respondents supported  raising teachers' salaries, offering merit pay, or both; limiting class sizes; assigning disruptive students to alternative environments; and having teachers encourage students' personal growth. The majority of those polled gave their own local high schools a grade of B or better. The respondents were 81 percent white and 58 percent women; 52 percent had attended college; and their age and geographic distribution were representative of the United States population in general.

        "description":"Over the past 20 years, the middle school has been a major innovative movement changing the face of intermediate education. While hard to define exactly, middle schools have different priorities and purposes than junior high schools. The former serve preadolescents (ages 10 to 14) through a balanced, comprehensive program. Middle school programs need clear definition and constant reevaluation to monitor program effectiveness and prevent slippage. Success depends heavily on sound curriculum development and management. This report describes the Wiles-Bondi Curriculum Management Plan (CMP), which draws from the work of Tyler and Taba and the widely used accreditation process format. The CMP introduces regularity into the change process by superimposing a management schemata over the  curriculum development framework and forcing values clarification and commitment along the way. Establishing goals, assessing needs, and determining priorities are essential steps. The model is based on several key points: involving school staff, administrators, and parents; directing change from the top; basing decisions on hard data; and driving change by evaluation and accountability. Developing an effective management team is a must. The standard curriculum development cycle of analysis, design implementation, and evaluation is bolstered by the CMP routine. Procedures are amply illustrated by 33 figures and 4 appendices that include sample survey forms, two articles on adolescents, and a list of selected teacher competencies. (MLH)",

These abilities can be exercised in different ways, however, and several different directions, purposes, and attitudes can be emphasized by the leader. These differences determine leadership style. Principals who understand their own leadership styles and who are able to fit their leadership styles to their particular situations (or their situations to their styles) are more likely to be effective leaders. Among the factors that must be considered are the extent to which human relationships are stressed, the extent to which technical tasks and their completion are stressed, and the  extent to which the leader can diagnose the situation in which leadership must be exercised. When making such a diagnosis, the leader must assess the knowledge of those doing the work, their ability and willingness to accept responsibility, and the leader's own expertise in the work situation in question. This publication reviews the developing concepts of leadership style, provides examples of the appropriate use of styles, and notes the value of understanding and using the concepts presented.

The teachers positioned six of the 18 behaviors between &quot;basically unethical&quot; and &quot;very unethical&quot; on the scale. The  administrators positioned 10 of the behaviors in this category, listing repeating confidential information, stealing school funds, and blaming others for errors as the least ethical. Both groups considered failing to report others' rule violations and hiring well-qualified family members as the least unethical of the 18 behaviors.

Whether actions to implement these evaluation program elements have been taken or whether they are currently being planned, there are policy issues involved that should be reviewed. One set of issues concerns identification of the purposes of the evaluation effort--an identification necessary if appropriate methods and instruments are to be selected. Establishing legitimate and informative criteria for making evaluative judgments is a  second important policy concern. Policies relating to the appropriate extent of testing--clarifying how much is too much and how much not enough--are also required. The needs of governmental bodies for different information can lead to conflicts that may be resolved by adopting policies that recognize the legitimate interests of all agencies. The social implications of evaluation programs must also be considered and policies devised to control program effects. Effective policy-making can enhance the prospects for developing programs that provide data for significant planning. (PGD)",

The paper focuses on the product and project options available to the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory's Database and School Profiling program, which offers technical and informational assistance to educational agencies. The paper first notes that technology's value lies in four areas: making task performance more efficient, producing higher quality products, automating difficult procedures, and extending capabilities. The paper then reviews six essential steps in the school improvement process as identified in the effective schools literature. Of these steps, data collection and profile production appear best  suited to automation, though reviewing profiles and developing improvement strategies are also important, complex steps that could benefit from the application of appropriate technological processes. The final portion of the paper is devoted to examining three specific data gathering and analysis needs of agencies engaged in centralized school improvement planning and four needs of agencies committed to supporting decentralized, local school improvement efforts. The problems, appropriate technological applications, and potential technical assistance strategies are identified for each of the seven needs. (PGD)",

        "description":"From the launch of Sputnik in 1957 until the approval of Proposition 13 in California in 1978, pressures for academic and social reform prompted numerous changes in the schools. Academic reforms were begun first, focusing on curricular revisions in reading, mathematics, and science. Social reform efforts led to the equalization of access to education and the creation of new courses to prepare children to become effective citizens. Conflicts between the two reform movements, an overabundance of innovations, and shrinking financial support eventually brought the era to an end. Some innovations did take root, however, including the use of behavioral objectives, the application of research techniques in curriculum development, the decentralization of decision-making, and the  development of new types of instructional materials. The changes also created some new dangers, such as those inherent in restricting instruction to the teaching of measurable skills, misusing research efforts to enhance fundraising, adopting \"teacherproof\" materials that can demoralize teachers, and focusing teacher education on academic content at the expense of pedagogy. Reviewing the mistakes of the post-Sputnik era and recalling the era's spirit of enthusiasm and dedication may help future reformers find effective paths to change. (PGD)",

Children (N=338) in 11 states who were originally tested in 1980 as part of the MAP standardization project were given a 4-hour battery of standardized tests. Standardized criterion measures included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Berry Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, the Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test, the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery, and the Walker Problem Behavior Identification Checklist. Parents and teachers completed behavior checklists and history forms.  Among subjective criterion measures were retention in school; teacher observations; receipt of special services; and report card grades in language, reading, mathematics, and physical education. Predictor variables examined were the MAP Total Score, the five MAP subtest scores, and the 27 MAP items. Data were subjected to correlational, T-test, stepwise multiple regression, and classificational analyses. Detailed results indicate that the predictive validity of the MAP compares favorably to similar predictive validity studies, and that the instrument can consistently and correctly identify the majority of children who later have difficulty in school, with relatively few misclassifications.

Six of their nonhandicapped friends (Group 2) received no training. Group 3 consisted of all other fourth- and fifth-graders who were also present during the recess period. Social interaction data were collected for the nonhandicapped students on five dependent variables: active participation, social initiation, responding, teaching, and reinforcing. Three independent variables (social interaction training for Group 1, feedback, and followup) were systematically introduced during intervention. Results indicated that, as training progressed, the frequency of the trained behaviors for Group 1  substantially increased. Effects of training generalized to Group 2, and Group 3 showed an overall increase in social interactions with the handicapped students. It is suggested that training a few subjects could produce a generalization effect, and that unless the nonhandicapped children are trained, there will not be any high level of interaction between handicapped and nonhandicapped students. Appended are a student handbook for peers of handicapped students, an accompanying training guide for teachers or trainers, and a section on data collection procedures. (JW)",

A subsequent study of the experimental treatment protocol (rather than the viability of the instrumentation) is proposed. (Author/JW)",

The initial paper, \"Issues in Organizational Structure\" (D. Sage), focuses on how the multiple units and operations of the special education system should be related and how the management authority and responsibility for those operations are established and executed. Four case studies follow: \"Overview of Organizational Structures within the Milwaukee Public School System's Exceptional Educational Program 1975-1985\" (W. Malloy); \"The Organizational Change of Special Services in an Urban Center: A Case Study\" (V. Johnson); \"Evolving Organizational Structures in Special Education: The Madison Example\" (L. Gruenewald, R. Loomis); and \"A Retrospective and  Prospective View of the Minneapolis Public Schools\" (K. Kromer). \"Organizational Change Processes\" (L. Burrello) discusses informal organizational structures, lists properties of organizational health (e.g., goal focus, cohesiveness, morale), analyzes processes described in the case studies, discusses interorganizational theory, and suggests local district approaches to effecting organizational change. The final two articles \"Reflections on Evolving Organizational Structures\" (J. Frymier) and \"Evolving Organizational Structures: A Summary (E. McCarthy) summarize major themes presented in the case studies and other papers. (JW)",

Interventions included Alley and Deshler's \"Learning Strategies\" approach (writing strand) and \"TARGETS,\" a systematic instructional strategy designed to enhance intrinsic motivation of learning disabled adolescents. Students were assigned to one of four treatment groups. Group 1 received a combination of the Strategies/TARGETS interventions. Group 2 received Strategies alone, Group 3 TARGETS alone (along with a traditional writing program), and Group 4 (the contrast group) received only the traditional writing program. Treatments were administered 3 days per week for 7 weeks.  Pretests, posttests, and 2-month follow-up tests consisted of two measures of written achievement and two motivation measures. Analysis of variance on ranked data indicated that gains made by the contrast group (Group 4) were significantly better than those of the other three treatment groups. Posttest performance was maintained for all four groups at follow-up testing. Results are discussed in terms of teacher effectiveness, potency of interventions, and the role of classroom climate variables. Substantial appendices include the teaching guide and lessons that comprise the TARGETS instructional strategy. (JW)",

Among seven areas of investigation were: (1) statistics on turnovers and vacancies in related service professional positions in Hawaii; (2) perspectives of administrators on related services; (3) perspectives of therapists who had left their positions; (4) and the extent to which speech/language therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy were provided as related services. Among findings were that a high rate of  turnover and job vacancies exists; that problems exist in implementing guidelines and/or eligibility criteria; and that consultation was perceived to be an appropriate service delivery model. In addition, chapters provide information on: the historical background of the AIRS Project; statistics on position vacancies, speech/language therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy; the AIRS Futures Conference; views of administrators, service providers, and special education teachers; and an evaluation of the DISTAR language program.

        "description":"A study examined the character, expressive qualities, and attitudes toward art (performing and visual) activities of handicapped Canadian adolescents (N=30) to determine how well current teaching of the arts meets the needs and expectations of these students. A review of literature on arts activities and exceptional students contributed to the development of an audiovisual questionnaire (modified for visually-impaired or hearing-impaired students) which explored students' perceptions of the purpose of art education, individual decision-making skills, and the role of language in the development of self-criticism and critical thinking. Data indicated that drawing and music were the preferred arts activities, that students preferred to work alone on individual projects, and that  students frequently did not receive adequate technical instruction (such as correct use of materials). The overall conclusion was that those students were self-conscious and self-taught who had not been equipped with the skills and perspectives for optimal learning. One recommendation stemming from the study was that methods used in teaching the arts to the visually handicapped could be used for all exceptional students. A 46-citation bibliography of journal articles, books, papers, and booklets is included. The written part of the 32-item questionnaire (involving open-ended questions and multiple choice) is presented in French and English. (CB)",

        "description":"The idea that &quot;natural speech&quot; as well as written discourse can be organized is now commonly accepted. There is also evidence that natural speech contains more coherence indicators than written texts do. This article proposes that one type of organizer, pragmatic connectives such as &quot;therefore, then, thus, while, however, but&quot; that have become void or depleted because they serve no real semantic function, emerged in Hebrew as the language gained its modern spoken form. These void pragmatic connectives (VPCs) entered the language with other transferred forms because the need for simulation of impromptu speech was pressing. It is argued that as Hebrew became established as a spoken language, the VPCs lost their connection with the culture they were drawn from and were later  augmented by independent VPCs emerging within vernacular Hebrew. This suggests that the emergence of VPCs and other discourse organizers in languages follows a universal principle, with a larger repertoire emerging in vernacular than in literary language. (MSE)",

Use of negatives as supports, in direct questions and imperatives, and in repetitions accounted for 37 percent of the negatives. Work in progress suggests that factors such as the degree of interaction and the expression of modality and mental attitudes, which often co-occur with negation, may explain further the use of negation.

        "description":"Although spoken language was the subject of attention among Soviet linguists for a short period in the 1920s, it has not attracted much attention since then. The main concern of Soviet linguists has been the forms of written language. Only at the end of the 1960s did linguists begin to record spontaneous speech on tape and study its forms. The impetus came partly from literature, where a young generation of writers produced &quot;living speech&quot; that no traditional grammar could account for. The studies of Russian impromptu speech have mostly concentrated on syntax, since that is where the greatest differences have been found in comparison with written language. (Author/MSE)",

The four studies generating the most empirical data are on: The Urban Dialect of Eskilstuna; The Child's Linguistic Identification; Language, Roles, and Social Relations; and Town and Hinterland: Urbanization and Language. Despite their different areas of study, all four projects have attempted to describe sociolinguistic variation and identify its causes at the phonological and morphological levels. All have found considerable inter- and intra-individual variation at the structural levels examined and support the idea that this variation is greater in  informal than formal situations. In turn, they have reinforced the importance of studying impromptu speech. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study investigated the possible relationship between college French teachers' cognitive style and their predictions of student performance. Four American-born French instructors and their 84 students at two state-supported universities formed the sample. The results suggest that the field-independent teachers may display more competence in predicting academic ability in both field-dependent and field-independent students, supporting previous research findings. It is proposed that these teachers may perceive the field-dependent students as needing inordinate help in developing strategies and hypotheses and cause the teachers to have higher expectations for the field-dependent student. This suggests that the mismatch of teacher and student cognitive style may have serious  consequences in the college classroom, since teacher attributions play a vital role in determining student achievement level. It may be that a field-independent instructor has a more positive effect on student performance. Further research into the use of teacher cognitive style in the classroom is warranted. (MSE)",

Most of the attention should be devoted to \"writing with composing,\" the making and conveying of meaning by writing. It concludes that the testing of second language writing would benefit greatly from the very intensive work undertaken in the field of native language acquisition, and that both disciplines would benefit from closer cross-disciplinary ties.

He comes to the text with certain expectations and uses a cyclical process of sampling, predicting, testing, and confirming to understand it. The overall goal of reading instruction is to produce motivated, independent, fluent, and efficient readers. Researchers and teachers have devised a number of teaching strategies and exercises to promote good reading skills and lead to reading comprehension. They have particularly emphasized the strategy of contextual guessing using typographical, pictorial, syntactic, and semantic clues. Not all students are equally successful at learning new words, but use a variety of strategies based on individual preferences and  learning styles. Research strongly suggests that knowledge of vocabulary and reading comprehension are positively correlated and that the systematic development of word identification skills will improve reading. However, fluent reading will only be accomplished through adequate, continuous practice. Foreign language teachers need to establish reading goals for their programs and follow a consistent plan including intensive and extensive reading from early in the instructional process. (MSE)",

        "description":"Workshops that help students develop leadership are offered twice a year by the Office of Student Activities at the University of Pittsburgh. Soon after the 12 programming committee chairs and the student coordinator are selected in December, they meet with advisory staff in a local hotel for a training workshop, the first session of the &quot;LeaderShop.&quot; A retraining workshop the following September is also offered as a refresher course. The LeaderShop uses a variety of learning/training strategies, including questionnaires, case studies, lectures, group discussion, and simulation. The student activities office helps promote student development by covering such areas as leadership and communication, time and conflict management, problem-solving and decision-making, planning and  organizing, and budgeting and evaluating. In fact, the committee chairpersons not only schedule, contract, and manage events, they also assume responsibility for their committee activities. As a group, they conduct their own meetings, resolve budget disputes, preside over committees, and monitor progress of their scheduled events. Involvement of students in the leadership sessions promotes self-expression, commitment, and accountability, and enables them to meet interesting people and expand cultural awareness and participation.

        "description":"The tension between competition and cooperation within the various sectors of higher education are considered by the president of the American Council on Education. In American society, the tension is between the pursuit of individual goals and commitment to the collective good. In higher education, competition for high achieving, traditional-age students is expensive and may cut into academic quality or the ability of the college to attract and aid the neediest students. Rather than multiple models of excellence that reflect pluralistic educational goals, many four-year colleges have embraced a single model of excellence, that of the research university. The single model of excellence promotes conflict among institutions, particularly in the public sector where the regional  state universities try to emulate the flagship institutions in the hope of improving their share of state funding. Additional concerns are: the assumption that good universities offer big-time athletics; increased tension between public and private institutions; competition to obtain federal appropriations; and the fact that most leaders are white males who have emerged from the faculty ranks. The need for member institutions of the American Council on Education to renew commitment to collaboration is discussed. (SW)",

The forums were held to determine the extent of environmental scanning activities in U.S. higher education and to form networks of individuals interested in adapting the techniques to their schools. Environmental scanning is increasingly being used by colleges to promote planning. The major benefit of an environmental scanning/forecasting system is to provide critical information for strategic planning. Such a system allows the institution to detect social, economic, technological, and political trends and  potential events that define the context of the future. In turn, decision-makers can anticipate what is happening in the state, region, nation, and world that will affect the nature and quality of the institution and its educational programs. Summaries of environmental scanning activities at 15 colleges and 3 additional projects/systems are provided, based on descriptions by individuals who attended the 1986 forums. Plans for sessions on environmental scanning at the 1987 annual meetings of AAHE, AIR, and SCUP are also described. (SW)",

Differences in the conditions affecting men's and women's need for aid are identified, along with actions that could improve women's participation in student aid programs. Gender issues in student aid policy include: loan burden, default, and bankruptcy; the award of merit scholarships; part-time attendance; financial independence; contradictory policies in public welfare and student aid programs; barriers in corporate benefit programs that pay tuition; child care as a cost of attending college; and access to higher education for minority women. The effects of gender issues are also examined for specific aid programs: Guaranteed Student Loans, Work Study Programs, National Direct Student Loans, Pell Grants, Supplemental  Educational Opportunity Grants; state scholarship and grant programs, athletic scholarships, military scholarships and veterans' benefits, and job training financial aid programs. Actions that could improve women's participation in aid programs include: targeting information toward women, funding child care, improving partnerships between high schools and colleges, and equalizing pay in college work programs. Data on enrollment, aid, resources, and attainments by gender are appended, along with information on financial assistance sources for women. (SW)",

The effects on public colleges of a proposition to compensate government workers and contractors are also considered. The 1986 Budget Act appropriates 55% of the State General Fund for education (39.4% for public schools and 15.7% for postsecondary education). In total, education receives a 9.3% increase over 1985-1986 funding levels. Figures are provided for capital outlay and current operations expenditures by category, as well as funding for the University of California, California State University, and the California community colleges. After reviewing the effect of Proposition 61 on the three  segments of public postsecondary education, it is concluded that passage of the proposition would jeopardize the ability of the state's public colleges and universities to recruit and retain senior-level faculty and administrators.

A historical perspective is provided of the development of these admission policies and practices at the University of California and California State University. Three policy issues are addressed: changing relations between regular and special-action admission criteria, the success of special-action admission and student support services in providing a viable route  to and through the universities, and the use of special-action admission pool to analyze the validity of admission criteria. Changes in admission, enrollment, and persistence patterns since 1975 are examined to determine the impact of special-action admissions. (SW)",

        "description":"This study of the effects of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) on the academic achievement of educationally disadvantaged students in grades 2 through 8 in four urban schools tested three hypotheses: (1) supplementary CAI programs are significantly more effective than non-CAI supplementary instruction approaches for disadvantaged students; (2) school-based supplementary CAI programs are significantly more effective than district-based programs for this group; and (3) vendor-based programs are less effective than programs developed within the system by school personnel. The effects of three types of CAI programs are compared--a vendor supplied microcomputer system, a system-wide CAI program, and a school-based system--with both experimental and control groups for each program.  The areas of study included reading comprehension; vocabulary; and mathematical concepts, problem-solving, computation, and composite skills. Analyses of the data failed to produce sufficient evidence to support the contention that disadvantaged students learned more when exposed to CAI, nor was there strong evidence that the impact of CAI varied with the system or the approach used. This report includes the purpose and objectives of the study; information on sample selection and procedures for data analysis and interpretation; study findings; and recommendations for future studies. Tables display data on the study sample by school, program, sex, and grade; pre- and posttest scores; and estimated posttest mean scores.

The research reviewed is discussed within a framework that takes the teacher's perspective seriously and asks questions about how new technology will be used in the schools. Issues addressed by this research include the elements of student collaborative learning; the roles of the teacher, print materials, and teacher guides; classroom disruption  due to the way computer-assisted instruction (CAI) materials are organized; and changes in student-teacher relationships. Data collection procedures for the two strands of the pilot project are also described, i.e., a projective test and audiotaped interviews to explore teachers' thinking on microcomputer use in the classroom, and videotaped class activities to show how microcomputers are actually being used. Detailed descriptions of interviews with a sixth grade science teacher and an eighth grade science teacher are provided, and a discussion of some of the concerns voiced by these two teachers concludes the paper.

The methodology tested the use of an algorithm in a quasi-experimental fashion by presenting it to students, and then determining the extent to which it increased their ability to solve LOGO problems. Four subjects, one each from grades 4, 5, 6, and 8, were presented with standard LOGO problems. (All students had received at least 4 hours of instruction in using LOGO commands.) Students were then rated using a Likert scale. The results indicate that a general problem solving algorithm does not  significantly change the problem solving ability of students as it relates to LOGO problems, which implies that a &quot;stronger&quot; algorithm approach should be developed for teaching problem solving for different types of problems. However, the results also suggest ways that LOGO problem solving techniques might generalize to more specific algorithms because of LOGO's highly visual nature, recursive features, and provision of immediate feedback. For the reinforcement of these aspects, LOGO appears to be a highly useful teaching tool. Five references are listed. (DJR)",

        "description":"The microcomputer offers social science field researchers a valuable tool for managing qualitative research data. In addition to the flexibility and efficiency of the microcomputer, the logic governing its programming and operation imposes a framework on the research process which necessitates that research decisions and strategies be explicit and logical. This progression enhances methodological rigor and improves the capacity of the research for generating and testing hypothesis. A key to the effective use of the microcomputer is its integration into the overall design of the research. Having such a helpful tool facilitating data storage and analysis provides relief to labor-intensive qualitative research, motivation to continue researching, and helps guide subsequent data  collection. The Alternative State Policy Mechanisms (ASPMp) Project is an example of a field study that is ideally suited to the use of microcomputers. By using the working hypothesis as a framework for data collection and capitalizing on the flexibility of the &quot;Quickfile II&quot; program, the project is able to increase the efficiency of data storage and retrieval, which, in turn, enhances the analytical process. On the other hand, the Assistant Principalship study presents some conditions where the disadvantages of using microcomputers outweigh the advantages. This example involves practical as well as research design issues, which may aid researchers as they consider the risks and benefits of computer assistance.

Structures for both groups were analyzed according to median distances within and between concepts describing the analysis, design, and evaluation components of a learning system design model. Results were interpreted for distance and dispersion of experts' and novices' concept organization by  determining the mean of the medians for each group and the standard deviations of the means. Findings showed experts' organization of concepts within the three components of the model to be more consistent with accepted structure of the instructional development process, and novices' structures to be more linear and less integrative in reference to the model. These results provide a framework for the theoretical interpretation of constructs underlying successful performance in instructional development. Such information can be used to guide selection, training, and assessment research of instructional developers.

        "description":"The schools of today and tomorrow must answer the challenge of increasing technology with firm purpose, clarity of objectives, and an immense awareness of the necessity for humanistic response. Educational systems can meet this challenge through the development and use of appropriate curriculum by motivated and trained teachers and administrators. Present and future curriculum must be keyed to the demanding nature of future trends, be flexible enough to reflect the society it educates, and be current, active, and relevant to the changes forged by the new technologies. Since curriculum selections and presentations are primarily the responsibility of state and local governments, the National Science Board Commission recommends national leadership to coordinate efforts in developing  curriculum that is relevant to students in a technological age. Recommendations by the commission reflect a plan for action which can be put into practice within structured school systems as they exist today. Specific applications at the school level also need to be considered to service the entire school community, students, and parents. Teachers and administrators need to be visionary, yet humanistic, in determining goals and setting means to obtain those goals. (DJR)",

        "description":"This study examines whether male and female teachers differ in: (1) their background or training for instructional uses of microcomputers, and (2) their uses of microcomputers to teach mathematics and science. Research carried out in 60 classrooms in 49 schools in 25 California school districts provided data on district and school microcomputer policies; classroom contexts; and teachers' characteristics, instructional decisions, and practices. Analyses of these data indicated that district and school characteristics and classroom organization and composition did not differ, by and large, among male and female teachers. Furthermore, gender was unrelated to teachers' subject matter and computer knowledge, patterns of microcomputer-based instruction, and instructional decisions and  practices. Both female and male teachers provide leadership in the microcomputer movement, have the relevant training and experience that contributes to microcomputer use, use microcomputers for instruction in a variety of ways, and present equally viable role models.

The testing system consisted of a data bank of tests based on the district mathematics objectives, equipment to machine score student answer sheets, and reports detailing student mastery of the objectives. This system was piloted by administrators and teachers at four district-selected schools. A detailed interview schedule was developed to elicit such information as background in the district; knowledge of the CMI system, including how, why, and by  whom it was selected; uses of the system for testing and instruction; technical problems; potential uses of the system; and its effects on school organization and instruction. Analysis of the responses of 49 school staff members--principals, resource teachers, teachers, and clerical staff from both pilot and nonpilot schools--identified a number of factors as keys to the implementation of the program: (1) planning; (2) communication and awareness of its purpose; (3) support from key personnel; (4) training; (5) technical issues and procedures; and (6) rewards and incentives for using the system. When viewed positively, these factors operated as facilitators to the acceptance and implementation of the system; however, when viewed negatively, the same factors operated as barriers.

The responses received from 202 faculty members (a 64% return) were analyzed using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS-X). It was found that faculty favor decentralization of online search services and expect their institutions to provide the hardware, access, and operating expenses. However, a large percentage of faculty also favor centralized online  services performed by librarians and realize the importance of having the library and librarians perform these services first or as the core service. Faculty favor faculty status and rank for academic librarians and feel that online services enhance that status. It is concluded that librarians can expect the continued use of library online services whether or not the services are decentralized. Notes are provided, and the survey questionnaire, cover letter, and statistical results are presented in 2 tables and 11 appendices. (KM)",

        "description":"This project examines anaphora (the linguistic device of abbreviated subsequent reference to a concept) in information retrieval (IR) systems in order to develop procedures to recognize anaphors in text and distinguish between anaphoric and non-anaphoric uses of a given term, estimate the number of anaphors appearing in bibliographic records, and assess the effect on retrieval performance when anaphors are replaced by their referents. In the first phase of the study, rules were developed to form the basis for an automatic procedure to recognize anaphoric terms in bibliographic databases. An examination of the titles and abstracts of 600 documents revealed that only 3.67 true anaphors occurred in the average abstract, suggesting that the effect of treating these terms in some way  to improve retrieval performance might be slight. In the second phase, 12 term weighting schemes were used to determine the relevance of each document to the corresponding query, and user's relevance judgements for the same searches were compared with the system's judgements for (1) searches using abstracts in which anaphors had been replaced with their referents, and (2) searches using abstracts with unresolved anaphors. These comparisons yielded mixed results, indicating that a straightforward substitution of referents for their anaphors will not improve retrieval performance in the majority of cases. It is concluded that future studies which treat document length more explicitly and study documents on an individual level are necessary. A bibliography is provided, and five lengthy  appendices include the preliminary test and functional indexes, the retrieval experiment and functional indexes, results of the linguistic analysis, test results of rule sets, retrieval test results, and summaries of statistical results for searches of INSPEC and PsycINFO.

A study was conducted to compare the student preference level for full-time instructors with that for part-time instructors. The enrollment distribution of 3,838 students who registered in 43 different courses with comparable class sections taught by either full-time instructors (130 class sections and 46 instructors) or part-time instructors (103 class sections and 57 instructors) was used to calculate a student preference score for the  instructor of each class section. Based on study findings, it was concluded that the full-time faculty student preference score was significantly higher than that score for part-time instructors. With 99% certainty, the difference between these scores was found to lie between 9% and 35% of the average course enrollment per section. A series of recommendations were developed to improve student relations with and perceptions of part-time faculty. A three-page bibliography concludes the document. (EJV)",

This section indicates that an ATF facilitates the transfer of credits from the community colleges to the universities, develops methods to communicate accurate information to students, reviews and updates the  content of the &quot;Arizona Higher Education Course Equivalency Guide,&quot; and establishes a communication process regarding program changes. The handbook goes on to describe the responsibilities of the community college ATF member, the university ATF member, the ATF chairperson, the ATF host, the Host Course Equivalency Guide (CEG) Coordinator, and the CEG Editor. Next, the process for updating the CEG is diagrammed. Appendices include information on the Academic Program Articulation Steering Committee; samples of information on ATF meetings and reports; CEG materials; a sample university curriculum check sheet for majors, Arizona community college districts and public universities, and ATF information.

The staff was also asked to nominate representatives for the college's staff development task force. Study findings, which were based on an overall response rate of 42%, were combined with a compilation of findings from institutional research on student demographics and personnel profiles to develop the 1-year plan. The parts of the plan that were implemented included: (1) an orientation for  new faculty at the beginning of fall semester, 1986; (2) a convocation for all faculty and staff during the second week of the fall term; (3) the continuation of minimal conference funding for all faculty; and (4) the planning of inservice programs using outside resource people. Appendices include survey instrument results, a summary of student demographics, a personnel profile of Mission College staff, and the staff development goal statement and final 1-year plan. (LAL)",

The first study investigated three goal structures (i.e., cooperative, individualistic, and cooperative with group competition), while the second added a \"homogeneous group\" cooperative condition. Study subjects were students from sections of a general psychology course, who were given expectation measures and individual achievement tests. In the cooperative condition, students worked in small groups during their section meetings to help prepare for exams, which were taken on individual and group bases. In the  group competition condition, students similarly worked in groups, with the highest-scoring groups receiving bonus points. In the individualistic condition, students worked individually in their sections and participated in whole class discussions. In the homogeneous group condition, students selected their own small work group, as opposed to having these groups teacher-assigned. Results from the two studies provided a mixed pattern of findings. While the first study provided support for the cooperative model in terms of improved expectations and achievement, poor student performance in the second study greatly diminished the benefits of cooperation.

        "description":"The success of critical thinking courses poses a significant threat to the conception and status of the humanities. In an effort to remediate deficiencies in the writing and reading skills of students attempting to undertake college-level work, courses have been developed which aim to improve the cognitive skills needed for effective communication, understanding, and persuasion. In addition, philosophers have successfully introduced courses on critical thinking or informal logic into the curriculum, and have had them classified as philosophy courses applying to liberal arts degree requirements. While these courses are valuable additions to the curriculum, are perhaps the most appropriate way to involve students with the philosophic tradition, and are appropriately taught by  philosophers within the philosophy department, they may not accomplish what philosophy and humanities requirements are meant to accomplish. In reviewing textbooks and course syllabi in the area of critical thinking, one is struck by the almost total absence of any reference to the classical tradition in philosophy. These courses, which are the only exposure to philosophy that most community college students will have, reduce the discipline to a set of intellectual skills--a methodology--and should not be used as a substitute for an introduction to philosophy course. While the critical thinking courses are responsive to the economic aspects of enrollment patterns and the immediate needs of students, they pay too little attention to past philosophic and cultural heritage and the long-term  needs of both students and their civilization. If philosophers are to teach courses in critical thinking and applied ethics as a service to students with skill deficiencies, these courses should not be part of the liberal arts core or general education program, but rather of the technical or career portion of the curricular requirements.

The interviews sought information on enrollment trends, funding, and course initiation in the areas of adult basic education (ABE), short-term vocational classes, continuing education for professionals, recreational and avocational courses, customized job training, distance learning, and programs for special populations. Among the major findings were: (1) 98% of the colleges offered short-term vocational courses, and 94% offered continuing education for professionals; (2) during fall 1986, the responding colleges served  271,400 adults in the seven program areas covered by the survey; (3) short-term vocational training, professional continuing education, and customized job training accounted for 49% of enrollments; (4) in terms of past and projected enrollments, ABE was the fastest growing area; (5) three factors were found to influence program trends; i.e., decisions by the college staff, decreased state reimbursement for recreational/avocational courses, and the use of off-campus facilities; (6) limited staff time was found to be a major constraint on the initiation of new contracted programs with business and industry; and (7) ABE and vocational training were the programs most often subsidized with state or federal monies.

Chapter 1 presents the issues, framework, and methods of the study; identifies the participating institutions; and gives an overview of the report. Chapter 2 provides contextual information about the environments for postsecondary education in each of the states represented in the study, while chapter 3 introduces the concept of conflicting cultures as an approach to understanding the barriers urban students experience in their pursuit of a  degree. In chapter 4, students attending urban colleges are introduced through their own words, and through comments of those who work closely with them. Chapters 5 and 6 examine urban community college and university programs and services in terms of their impact on students interested in completing a four-year degree. The transfer process and some successful efforts aimed at articulation are the focus of chapter 7. Chapter 8 offers student perceptions of the transfer process. Finally chapter 9 discusses the implications of the study in the form of a series of recommendations. (EJV)",

Focusing on the naturally occurring context of the &quot;give and take&quot; game format, this investigation discloses the role of the interaction pattern in the language acquisition process, including the beginning and development of query techniques, the linguistic and conceptual elaboration of terms associated with first actions, and the use of the first deictic terms. Observations support the view that very early in life infants find themselves involved in highly ranked joint action routines, the progressive mastery of which represents true &quot;pragmatic learning.&quot; The practice of activities such as the &quot;give and take game&quot; allows the  infant to dominate the course of action, thereby regulating its activity with an adult through the use of a vast set of communicative procedures. Over time, these procedures are generalized across similar situations, becoming &quot;regulatory categories.&quot; In joint action the child elaborates notions, such as agent, action, receiver, place, possession, etc., and establishes many distinctions about its physical environment. Such distinctions are usually linguistically marked in the adult's language and provide easy access to grammatical specifications marking semantic relations. Once fundamental rules are mastered, specific joint action formats are expanded across a vast number of situations, thereby allowing greater linguistic complexity. (RH)",

Imitation was defined as children's utterances which maintained the order of adult utterances, were produced in the same tone, and which repeated at least one of the last three words produced by the adult. While analysis revealed a high number of imitations, imitations were low in number when compared to total language used. Maximum use of imitation occurred when subjects were between 20 and 22 months of age. Imitations were especially evident in conversational situations, such as reading, which involve the lexical procedure of designation and in which child and adult jointly attend to an object.  Children were found to actively use exclusive imitation (imitations with no creative use in any context) in different contexts at different ages. Findings suggest that imitation appears to be an important mechanism by which children incorporate words into their early vocabulary, maintain dialogue, and coordinate their speech with adult linguistic behavior.

        "description":"To assess the nature and importance of family support and education programs which have increased in number during the last decade, this prepared statement addresses three questions: (1) What is known about the ways in which context, defined as factors outside the nuclear family, affects a family's capacity to rear its children and build a fulfilling family life? (2) What are the main characteristics of family support and education programs and how do they strengthen, reinforce, and empower families? (3) Do such programs offer a common ground on which policy makers from a variety of perspectives can stand in order to promote the development of children and families? It is argued that the steady proliferation of family support and education programs from the grass-roots level,  rather than from the federal level, reflects a systemic reaction to the paradox that contemporary families are faced with increasing stress at the same time that they are asked to assume a larger role in the care of dependents. It is further argued that these family support and education programs also reflect broader national debates about social policy for families in that they ask: What can governmental and other community institutions do to enhance the family's capacity to help itself and others? A reference list of over 30 items is included. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper briefly reviews current knowledge about child abuse in foster care, and presents preliminary findings from a study identifying characteristics of abused children by type of abuse, and type of abuse by behavior of the child. Research indicates that foster children at risk for abuse exhibit specific characteristics, such as having experienced multiple placements, or having special needs or handicapping conditions. Foster parents who maltreat children are typically older, more affluent, and more likely to be married than maltreating biological parents. Agency practices related to foster care abuse include making emergency placements, overloading foster homes, mismatching child and family, infrequent home visits, and lack of foster parent training. Analysis of 176 abuse  incidents shows that certain children may be more vulnerable to abuse in family foster homes than others. Data strongly suggest that foster parents need help in understanding toileting behavior and the regression in this area that is likely to occur when a child undergoes trauma. Behaviors interpretable as direct challenges to adult authority were among those most likely to lead to physical abuse, especially those involving physical aggression or use of bad language toward the adult. If these children are to be safely placed, potential foster families must receive better training. (RH)",

(2) Do mothers use infants' first words in a context-bound manner when interacting with their infants? (3) What relationship, if any, exists between infants' initial use of early words and mothers' use of the same words when she interacts with her infant? Four firstborn infants, who came from homes in which English was the only language spoken, participated in the study. Observations took place once a month while the infant was between 6 and 10 months of age and once a fortnight when the infant was between 10 and 24 months of age. Each mother-infant pair was video-recorded through a one-way mirror in sessions lasting 20 minutes.  Mothers were asked to keep a diary of all new sounds, words, or phrases that their infants produced. Findings indicated that infants' first words were not always context-bound, mothers did not always use infants' first words in a context-bound manner, and, while infants' initial use of a particular word usually bore a close resemblance to the most frequent maternal use of that word, at least three major types of relationships linked mother's most frequent use and infant's first use of a word.

        "description":"Part of a longitudinal study of women and their first-born children who have different employment and day care experiences during the children's first three years of life, this study focuses on the socioemotional development of children at 18 months of age, who had received at least nine months of continuous day care. Particular attention is given to the effects of group care in day nurseries, individual care by a relative, individual care by a childminder, and home care by the mother. Data for 166 children were obtained from three measures: a stranger approach/separation/reunion sequence; the first seven items of the Infant Behavior Record, which uses ratings to describe children's behavior during the administration of the Bayley Mental Development Index Scale; and a  socioemotional development questionnaire, which was designed to obtain data on children's behavior from the mother's experience. While not supporting parents' belief that nursery care would improve their children's sociability, findings indicate that day care experience did significantly affect children's socioemotional development. Children in nursery care showed less sign of pleasure when approached by a stranger than children in the other groups. Upon separation from the mother in the presence of the stranger, children's concern increased across home, relative, childminder, and nursery groups. Infant Behavior Record data from nursery group children showed that they were less oriented than others to people and were more negative in mood. The socioemotional development questionnaire  showed no effects associated with day care experience. (RH)",

The executive summary of this report identifies the major goals, common strategies, and needs of program respondents. Chapter 1 summarizes a series of 15 focus group interviews held with Black and Mexican-American women, and subsequent interviews with their health care providers, concerning sources and needs for health information. Chapter 2 provides a review of the health education literature addressing low-income and minority populations. (This review covers material appearing in or after 1980 whereas the earlier Juarez review covered the decade of the 1970s.) Chapters 3  through 12 summarize survey findings on the following topics: prepregnancy, prenatal, postnatal, and comprehensive programs; breastfeeding; nutrition; substance use during pregnancy; rural populations; Native Americans; and adolescent pregnancy. The findings are categorized according to the service/health care settings or type of educational programs that responded to the survey. Each summary chapter includes sections, where appropriate, on characteristics of programs, services and strategies, staffing, outreach, educational programs, needs for educational materials, successes, and advice and observations. Chapter 13 identifies other sources of information, educational materials, and programs related to maternal and infant health. The survey instrument is presented as Appendix A.  Appendices B and C describe services available through the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program and the National Health Law Program.

At the onset of the project, workers across the state had no uniform method of obtaining case information. Therefore, an automated case investigation system was developed. Development of the system involved the identification of data items needed for making decisions about child abuse and neglect investigations, creation of a manual case investigation workbook, and creation of an automated case investigation support system that also provided a foundation for case planning. The two latter components, the manual and the system, were designed to function independently as an investigation documentation system, or  to be used jointly as a more comprehensive system. This process evaluation of the CDP contains a narrative description of activities, events, and issues relevant to establishing the project and achieving its objectives.

Part One outlines landmark efforts accomplished through a series of UNESCO regional conferences beginning in 1962. For example, from 1978-1985, the Asia and the Pacific Programme of Educational Innovation for Development supported almost 600 activities at inter-country and national levels, directly involving 11,500 educators in 24 countries. Activities encompassed universalization of primary education; the struggle against illiteracy; development of science and technology education; promotion of technical and vocational education;  development of environmental, population, and higher education; training educational personnel; and educational planning and administration, facilities development, and research. Part Two provides statistical data to document the situation of education in the region, including population, income, poverty, life expectancy, educational attainment, enrollment, dropout percentages, teaching staff, pupil-teacher ratios, expenditures, and illiteracy rates. Part Three details the goals, priorities, and recommendations of the Fifth Regional Conference of Ministers of Education and Those Responsible for Economic Planning in Asia and the Pacific which met in Bangkok in 1985. Part Four describes recommended actions for regional education development in the areas of educational planning and  management, personnel preparation/training, research, experimentation and innovation, and international cooperation.

The workshop was designed to analyze present policies relating to migrant handicapped students, to develop strategies for enhancing services for these students, and to stimulate coordination among migrant, regular, bilingual, and special educators. The 140 participants were divided into work groups which presented findings, recommendations, and actions for 24 problem areas in awareness, communication, information transfer, identification/diagnosis, interagency coordination, funding, staff training, language needs, assessment, bilingual personnel, delivery  systems, and instructional programs. Participants ranking 27 problem statements found the greatest concerns to be raising awareness of migrant handicapped student needs, enhancing communication about the students, and improving diagnosis, assessment, and cognizance of cultural and language needs of migrant students. Accompanying tables illustrate workshop planning/evaluation processes and provide rankings of problems with profiles of work group priorities and recommendations. Appendices key workshop grouping to results of a preliminary 1985 survey of migrant students in California special education, provide text of the California State Department of Education Interdivision Agreement of Migrant Children with Exceptional Needs, and include workshop materials and list of participants.

The Mountain Women's Exchange--a network of seven community organizations run by low-income women in Campbell County, Tennessee, and Whitley County, Kentucky--began RCEC in 1983 as part of its effort to provide training, employment, and services to women of the area. RCEC developed curriculum to identify rural leadership competencies required for someone committed to living and improving rural Appalachian communities and recruited and oriented faculty. RCEC's success demonstrated the importance of community organizations in  organizing educational opportunities. RCEC offered lessons in relating college education to community improvement strategies, in collaboration with institutions of higher education, and in orienting faculty to nontraditional students. This study reports RCEC's history, goals, objectives, and evaluation processes/results and reviews program activities and surveys of students, faculty, and community leaders. A review of literature on rural adult education and on Appalachian socioeconomic trends establishes the context of the RCEC. The report emphasizes development of learner-driven competency-based adult education relevant to rural living and rural leadership training. Appendices provide survey responses, RCEC organizational structure, and course list. (LFL)",

Participants were 35 teachers in 9 rural schools, each assigned to a peer coaching team consisting of teachers in the same school but with different grade and/or subject assignments and different levels of experience. Participants met monthly with the project director to discuss some aspect of effective schools research and practice using the Effective Teaching Checklist developed by Tennessee Technological University. Peer team members observed each other teaching, ranked specified teaching behaviors, reviewed observation results, and developed personal instructional improvement goals based on the  observations. Participants used the Effective Teaching Checklist to evaluate video-tapes of their lessons recorded at the beginning and end of the school year. Analysis of the data showed significant differences in 8 of 12 categories evaluated: selection of methods, selection of materials, instruction, questioning, motivation, classroom management, providing practice, and evaluation and feedback. In this study, mediated peer coaching was effective in changing overall teaching behaviors and was a cost-effective method of providing in-class feedback and support for rural teachers.

        "description":"To address rural schools' growing need for teachers who can teach in both elementary and special education, Arkansas College has begun a 4-year program of dual certification that will prepare teachers for elementary and special education assignments. Serving a largely rural area, Arkansas College has first hand experience with the problems facing rural schools and is especially sensitive to their needs. The college began to study the dual certification option because of repeated requests from area schools to provide teachers with the training to teach proficiently in more than one area. Many of these rural schools do not need a full-time special education teacher, but do need a teacher who can teach in this area for a portion of the day and at the same time have the training to  work in another area for the balance of the day. Dual certification training will not only increase the regular teacher's effectiveness--the special education teacher will also be better prepared to work with students in the mainstream. Such teachers will know what the regular education teacher expects from the student and will better understand how to make the transition between regular and special education experience. A summary of public schools in a 10-county area and a sample academic program check sheet are attached. (JHZ)",

Canoncito Navajo Reservation, the Isleta Pueblo, and urban Indian students in Albuquerque participated in the program. Personnel consisted of a project coordinator, resource teacher, 39 tutors, and a secretary. Administration, evaluation, and training programs were centralized, while service delivery was adapted to each community's needs. Twenty-one Canoncito students in grades 6-12 exceeded program objectives in 7 school-related skill areas, while their parents met objectives for parent participation. The Isleta component served 51 middle school and 123 high school students;  the urban component served 75 elementary school, 132 middle school, and 134 high school students. Both components met objectives of 50% of students maintaining/improving their grades and improving in eight school-related skill areas. Significant majorities of cooperating classroom teachers (Canoncito 90%, Isleta 76%, Urban 62%) indicated that students' success justified time spent on tutoring outside classrooms. A grant extension provided tutoring to 129 additional students during summer session. The program evaluation contains recommendations for improvement, tables summarizing program data, summary of responses to tutor questionnaire, and copies of reporting forms. (LFL)",

        "description":"An evaluative questionnaire completed by 30 high school principals and 159 high school students who used the TI-IN Network demonstrated the advantages of interactive satellite television instruction for rural and small schools. The study found that a large number of subscribers to TI-IN were small rural high schools whose principals stated that satellite courses were an integral part of their school's curriculum. Most students (85%) enrolled in one satellite course, 14% in two courses, and 1% in three different courses. Most participating students were seniors (44%), followed by juniors (25%), and sophomores (22%); 80% of the schools limited enrollment in satellite courses to &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; students. Most principals rated student/teacher interaction as excellent/very good and  students reported initiating two to three telephone calls each week to television teachers during broadcasts. Students perceived satellite courses as more difficult than regular classes (65%) and 70% would prefer regular classrooms. Major strengths of interactive satellite instruction included a variety of classes available, television teacher personality, and interesting instruction. Least liked aspects included too much homework, too difficult, impersonal, and difficult telephone communication. The report describes the TI-IN Network, reviews costs of Network use, and discusses advantages of interactive satellite instruction in general. (LFL)",

The responses were analyzed with regard to possible relationships between school size, type of school district, geographic location of the school district, and the number and type of courses offered that contained environmental education topics. The study indicated that there were no relationships between any of the variables studied except for the environmental education courses and their curricular headings. Schools tended to  offer environmental education courses under the curricular headings of science, social studies, vocational education, physical education/health, and home economics. Three environmental education topics were taught in at least 50 percent of the courses. Appendices include a list of high schools in the study and the survey instrument. (TW)",

The software package used in the study was the simulation, Volcanoes, by Earthware Computer Services. The sample population consisted of 20 average and below average eighth grade earth science students who were randomly assigned to one of two computer simulation laboratories. Teacher behavior varied between the two laboratories. In one laboratory, the teacher was a content and simulation expert, employed a discovery and questioning approach to instruction, and moved about among the students. In the other laboratory, the teacher played the role of one  unfamiliar with the content of the simulation, offered only minimal assistance, and remained at the teacher's desk. Student attitudes and achievement were measured. Positive attitudes toward science, scientists, and microcomputers were evidenced. Based on the posttest measure, neither laboratory group learned significantly more than the other about the content of the volcanoes simulation. Results are discussed and the attributes of good simulation courseware are specified. (ML)",

The first concerns individualistic and cooperative goal structures in high school mathematics achievement. Two general mathematics classes were taught a unit on percents, one with a cooperative and the other an individualistic goal structure. The cooperatively goal structured classroom demonstrated significantly higher posttest achievement scores than the individualistic group. The second paper is on cooperative learning in ninth grade remedial mathematics classes. One class used a modified team approach, while the other used an individualistic goal structure including class lecture, individual seatwork, and homework. Significant increase in mean post-test scores was obtained,  suggesting that cooperative strategies are effective. The third paper is written on cooperative versus competitive reward-structured secondary science classroom achievement. Two biology classes were taught an identical unit, one in an individually competitive structure and one using a cooperative structure called the group-investigation model. No significant differences were found. (MNS)",

Participants were seven teachers of students in grades from 2 to 6 who had volunteered for the project after being selected as potential lead teachers in mathematics. The inservice consisted of teacher observations, group inservice on effective teaching, individual planning and recommendations for becoming more effective, demonstration teaching, and more observations together with feedback and discussion. The results indicate that these seven elementary teachers increased the quantity of their developmental instruction to about half of their class period, from about 11 minutes each day to about 20 minutes  each day. The inservice model also had a positive effect on the quality of the developmental instruction provided: teachers attended to more details related to instruction, used models more often, and used process questions to assess student understanding more effectively. As an inservice model, the one used in this project has the potential of effectively changing the behavior of teachers and improving instruction. Appendices contain samples of postobservation feedback for grades 4 and 6, papers on teaching mathematics concepts and algorithms, and an administrator/teacher feedback questionnaire. (Author/MNS)",

In &quot;Social Reconstructionism: A Critical Look,&quot; Robert Koole briefly discusses the contributions of social reconstructionists to the issue of the role of schooling and their influence on educational thought. In &quot;Social Reconstructionism and Education,&quot; Denise Stocco reviews the philosophy of Harold Rugg, George Counts, Theodore Brameld, and the proponents of social reconstructionism in the 1970s. Kirk Charron traces the impact of the journal published by the advocates of social reconstructionism led by George Counts in &quot;The Depression and the Emergence of Social Reconstructionist Theory.&quot; In &quot;Social Reconstructionism and the Communal  Movement of the Sixties&quot; Barbara Maheu relates the communal movement of the 1960s and 1970s to the theory of social reconstructionism and discusses its impact on education. In &quot;Social Reconstructionism and Its Application to the 1971 Alberta Social Studies Curriculum&quot; Sheila Mawson examines the major tenets of reconstructionism and its application to the Alberta (Canada) curriculum. Finally, using specific examples, Gordon R. Thomas discusses the opportunities and restrictions of the 1981 Alberta Social Studies Curriculum in &quot;Opportunities and Limitations: Applying Social Reconstructionism to Alberta Social Studies.&quot; (SY)",

Part 2 defines basic geography skills as suggested in &quot;Guidelines for Geographic Education.&quot; These skills include asking geographic questions, acquiring geographic information, presenting and interpreting this information, and developing and testing geographic generalizations. Part 3 considers the likely learning outcomes expected if students are provided with skills that improve their geographic literacy. These skills include an increased  awareness that absolute and relative location are significant aspects of every natural and cultural feature on earth, an understanding of the significance of place in terms of both natural and human characteristics, a greater awareness of human adaptation to natural environments, an increased appreciation of global interdependence, and greater use of the concept of region. These acquired skills should enable students to think more effectively about their world. (CBC)",

It contains: (1) a brief summary of basic information about Chapter 1; (2) a description of recent Chapter 1 regulations and legal requirements, history of parent involvement, and suggestions on how  parent advocates can assist parents; (3) suggestions for parents on how to use their rights to ensure a strong parent involvement program; (4) a draft policy for school districts which may serve as a model for local parent involvement policies; and (5) a set of survey questions to help parents look at how well parent involvement is working in their own Chapter 1 programs.

        "description":"Existing demographic analyses do not explain the negative relationship between population growth and life-support systems that are now emerging in scores of developing countries. The demographic transition, a theory first outlined by demographer Frank Notestein in 1945, classified all societies into one of three stages. Drawing heavily on the European experience, it has provided the conceptual framework for a generation of demographic research. During the first stage of the demographic transition, which characterizes premodern societies, both birth and death rates are high and population grows slowly, if at all. In the second stage, living conditions improve as public health measures, including mass immunizations, are introduced and food production expands. Birth rates remain  high, but death rates fall and population grows rapidly. The third state follows when economic and social gains, including lower infant mortality rates, reduce the desire for large families. As in the first stage, birth rates and death rates are in equilibrium, but at a much lower level. The theorists do not say what happens when developing countries get trapped in the second stage, unable to achieve the economic and social gains that are counted upon to reduce births. Nor does the theory explain what happens when second-stage population growth rates of 3% per year continue indefinitely and begin to overwhelm local life-support systems. (BZ)",

The essential assumptions and values of democracy include the principle of inalienable rights, respect for certain institutions such as a representative government, an independent judiciary, the family, and the church. A democracy depends on schools which help to foster a kind of character which respects the law, is willing both to offer and accept criticism, and respects the value of the individual. When teaching about democracy, the schools need only to give the children the truth; democracy's achievements as well as its faults. Children should know the whole truth about their own countries and should know that there are  systems of government that cannot be morally sanctioned. If students are given the whole truth about democracy's record and the comparable record of other political systems, they will never hesitate to stand up for democracy. (APG)",

Part one of this report gives the background and current state of the project. Part two discusses the hypotheses and tentative evidence for both confirmation and disconfirmation, as well as some unanticipated results.

Part five is a discussion of the effect of the program in the teacher-participants' classrooms.

In examining the goals of mentoring-induction programs, the functions of evaluation (gatekeeping), retention of new teachers, socialization of newcomers, and improvement of work performance are discussed as they relate to the responsibilities of the mentor. The wide variety of roles that mentors perform include teacher, role model, consultant, friend, door opener, confidant, advocate, protector, listener, and counselor. Mentors can also provide new teachers with help in classroom instruction and  management, relations with other teachers, administrators, and parents; in addition, they can help to alleviate isolation, anxiety, and self-doubt. Mentors may also play a role in helping to solve personal problems. Suggestions are made for improving mentoring programs and making them more effective. (JD)",

Less anxiety about teaching and less concern about survival was reported following student teaching. Attitude towards teaching remained positive for the total sample; however, males and secondary majors reported a less positive attitude and more anxiety about teaching following student teaching. Less anxiety and concern was reported about: (1) being observed while teaching; (2) feeling adequate as a teacher;  (3) being accepted and respected by other professionals; (4) the ability to perform before a class; and (5) coping with parent-teacher conferences. The student characteristics of teaching field, gender, assurance of decision to teach, perceived effectiveness as a future teacher, anticipated grade level of teaching, and when the prospective teacher decided to become a teacher were found to be related to one or more of the measures.

This study, the first part of A Study of High School Excellence, was designed to document changes in the achievement of high school seniors between 1972 and 1980, to identify the school and student factors related to these changes, and to examine the policy implications of the findings. Information on 1972 high school seniors and their schools comes from the National Center for Education Statistic's (NCES) National Longitudinal Study of the High School Senior Class of 1972. Data on 1980 high school seniors and their schools were drawn from a second NCES longitudinal study, High School and Beyond. Student achievement was measured by achievement tests in vocabulary, mathematics and reading administered to seniors at  the time of the surveys. A &quot;step down&quot; analysis of covariance was used to estimate how 1972-1980 changes in population demographics, student behavior, school characteristics and home educational support system affected the average score decline. Findings suggested that the major factor contributing to test score decline was a decreased academic emphasis in the educational process. (JAZ)",

The experiment made novel use of partially balanced incomplete block designs that facilitated the unbiased estimation of certain main effects without requiring readers to assess the same paper several times. In addition, estimates were obtained of the improvement in reliability that results from removing variability from systematic sources of variation by an appropriate adjustment of the raw scores. This statistical calibration appears to be a cost-effective approach to enhancing scoring reliability when compared to simply increasing the number of readings per paper. The results  of the experiment also provide a framework for examining other, simpler calibration strategies. One such strategy is briefly examined. (Author/JAZ)",

Items on the mathematics subtest of the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress (STEP) were divided into Basic Skills, and High-level Skills. Subjects' overall eighth-grade averages, as a measure of previous achievement, were used as the covariate in the study. Results of the data analyses indicate that the Basic Skills mean  increased significantly between 1979 and 1981 but did not change significantly thereafter. The observed increase was constant for students at all levels of achievement. Analyses of High-level Skills means indicate that there was a significant interaction with level of achievement. Low achievers demonstrated a significant increase, and high achievers demonstrated a significant decline in High-level Skills scores between 1979 and 1983. Implications of the findings and limitations on the conclusions are discussed. (Author/JAZ)",

Students' efforts to study were indicated by their responses to items on time spent doing homework, completing homework on time, answering questions in class, soliciting teachers' help, listening in class, being late to class, and cutting class. Students' feelings of efficacy versus futility were measured by items about obtaining rewards as a result of effort. Academic motivation was indicated by how important it was to do well and by the desired  grade. Results confirmed the expected positive relationships of motivation and efficacy to effort. The predicted negative relationship of futility to effort was weaker. Results of examining teachers' testing practices indicated that students' perceptions of communication, feedback, correspondence, and helpfulness were strongly interrelated; they were also related to efficacy and self-reported effort. The questionnaires are appended. (GDC).",

The system consisted of a network of IBM Personal Computers running a slightly modified version of the commercially available MicroCAT Testing System. It was configured to fit transparently into the school's computer-managed instruction system. After a few minor adjustments and a few added features, the system met its goal of paralleling the paper-and-pencil version of the tests with a minimum of change in standard testing procedures. Now in place, the system provides a base on which diagnostic testing research can begin. Diagnostic testing will be implemented using the custom interface included in MicroCAT, which allows  users to link FORTRAN or Pascal procedures to MicroCAT. (Author/JAZ)",

The 60 analogy items covered five categories of relationships: antonyms, case relations, class inclusion, part-whole relations, and similars. Three different item types separated knowledge of the family component from the specific component: heterogeneous-same, heterogeneous-different, and homogeneous. Analyses of the results indicated an interaction between relation family and item type. The main effect was not significant for relations, but it was for item type. When performance on heterogeneous-same and heterogeneous-different items was compared, significant main effects were found  for the kind of relation, item type, and interaction of relation and type. When Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and SRT scores were correlated, verbal SAT scores were postively correlated with overall SRT. Surprisingly, SAT mathematics scores were more highly correlated than verbal SAT scores. The SRT and scoring key are appended. (GDC)",

        "description":"How much do 17-year olds know about U.S. history and literature? The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has been gathering information about the educational attainment of American students in a variety of subject areas, but no study had focused solely on students' basic knowledge of American history and their familiarity with major authors, themes, and characters of Western literature. An assessment probe was designed to supply systematic information about the extent to which this knowledge is acquired by students in American schools. An initial draft of the assessment probe, developed by staff members of NAEP, was reviewed by almost 100 educators to ensure that the assessment topics did not diverge from current teaching practice. The final draft reflects the  suggested changes. An assessment of the literacy of 17-year-olds included U.S. history and general literature because it was felt that literacy includes not only communication skills but also knowledge about the variety of topics that form the basis of dialogue and information sharing. The National Commission on Excellence in Education named history and literature among its new basics. The U.S. history topics are arranged by chronological periods: before 1763; 1763-1815; 1815-1877; 1877-1920; 1920-1945; and 1945-present. Care was taken to address topics relevant to political history, women's history, Black history, labor history, technology, geography, immigration, and foreign policy. Criteria for considering certain works of literature as fundamental to our culture are given for the  following genres: (1) novels, short stories, and plays; (2) myths, epics, and Biblical characters and stories; (3) poetry; and (4) nonfiction.

Subjects were two successive cohorts of entering kindergarten children for whom Slingerland Tests scores and scores from either the Cognitive Abilities Test or the Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices were obtained. Correlational analysis was performed using these scores, subsequent kindergarten achievement and first-grade class placement for both cohorts, and first-grade achievement for the first cohort. Modest predictive validity for the Slingerland Tests was observed, stronger than the Raven Test and weaker than the Cognitive Ability  Test for overall achievement. Weak but significant class placement prediction was also observed for the Slingerland Tests. An index based upon discrepant performance on the Slingerland and the more standard measures of mental ability produced inconsistent results and was redundant with single measures of general ability used alone.

        "description":"LISREL-type structural equation modeling is a powerful statistical technique that seems appropriate for social science variables which are complex and difficult to measure. The literature on the specification, estimation, and testing of such models is voluminous. The greatest proportion of this literature, however, focuses on the technical aspects of LISREL, and many are far advanced in statistical sophistication so as to be of little or no help to the novice modeler. This paper presents a &quot;philosophical&quot; approach to structural equation modeling and examines some of the basic concepts and assumptions underlying the formulation of these models. The rationales for the structural equation model and the measurement model are outlined, and the foundations of specification and  interpretation clarified. As part of the SPSS-X package, LISREL will be readily available to many applied researchers. With this heightened availability of a complicated statistical procedure will undoubtedly come many misuses and abuses. Social scientists should become familiar with the theoretical premises of the method. (Author/JAZ)",

        "description":"This paper describes the development, validation, and use of a research instrument, the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), designed to assess the environment of small higher education classrooms. The instrument evaluates students' or instructors' perceptions of the following seven psychosocial dimensions of actual or preferred classroom environment: personalization, involvement, student cohesiveness, satisfaction, task orientation, innovation, and individualization. Administration of the CUCEI to 372 students in 34 classes and to 20 instructors attested to the internal consistency reliability and discriminant validity of the actual and preferred forms with either the individual or the class mean as the unit of analysis, and supported the ability of  the actual form to differentiate between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. A research application of the CUCEI involving associations between student outcomes and classroom environment tentatively suggested that the nature of the classroom environment affects outcomes. Another research application suggested that both students and instructors preferred a more favorable classroom environment than the one actually present, and that instructors viewed classroom environments more positively than did their students in the same classrooms. Desirable future applications of the CUCEI for research purposes and in improving teaching in higher education are considered. A copy of the inventory and a three-page list of references are included in the appendix. (JAZ)",

Cluster analysis, using a non-hierarchical ISODATA approach, revealed a  three-cluster solution: schools were broadly labelled as self-survival, indifferent, or cooperative and motivated. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated significant effects for school type, sex, and grade.

Job skills were tested in two occupational areas: use of a micrometer and invoice completion. Some performance tests were designed by researchers and some by the trainees' supervisors, who administered the tests. Standardized national tests were not used. One purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and implications of this system of decentralized testing, in which practical tests were designed and administered following central guidelines. The other major purpose of this study was to examine the factors affecting test reliability, within-site examiner reliability, and the  comparability of test content and standards across sites. Results indicated that of the examiners who were inconsistent in their application of judgment criteria, five percent were inconsistent in relation to their own micrometer exercises, and 45 percent were inconsistent with their own invoice tests. There appeared to be considerable variation in the standards used between different raters. Results from studying the internal reliability estimates revealed the dangers of a single assessment. The trainees' behavior was extremely variable when performance on two different tasks was assessed. Appendixes describe the methodology more fully and provide formulae for reliability coefficients.

Input variables include consultee and consultant characteristics, and problems presented by the consultee. Process variables include techniques used to encourage the consultee to work on the presenting problems. Outcome variables are those variables that reflect changes resulting from consultation. The following problems and prospects are highlighted: (1) a need for a programmatic research effort; (2) an over-reliance on  reports from consultees to validate the effectiveness of consultation; (3) a need for consultation researchers to describe more specifically the consultation process; (4) a need for further work on social influence factors in consultation; (5) a need for research on the acceptability of interventions; (6) a need to develop straightforward, heuristic measures of organizational environment; and (7) a need to study expert consultants in addition to trainees.

Although the overall goal of each state program is assessing performance related to designated learning objectives, the programs vary widely in basic content and analytic approach. The assessment analyzed performance data at the elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels of schooling, focusing on year-to-year trends. The analysis had two major components: (1) assessment of the  common performance areas of reading and mathematics; and (2) the assessment of unique performance areas which addressed content skills only with a particular state (self-esteem, understanding others, writing, interest in school, social responsibility, knowledge of law and government, health, creativity, career awareness, appreciating human accomplishments, and knowledge of human accomplishments, in Pennsylvania; spelling and language, in Delaware; and language, in Maryland). The findings suggest that student achievement performance trends in the four state regions are generally positive and consistent with results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Long term trends tend to be most positive at the elementary level and decrease at the intermediate and secondary levels,  suggesting that more attention be given to school improvement programs aimed at secondary education.

On the basis of interviews with 12 New Orleans teachers and the experiences of the authors in working in two large city testing offices (Dallas and New Orleans), the problems (&quot;tentacles&quot;) related to testing and test data use are discussed in the following categories: (1) test data; (2) the theoretical ideal; (3) monitoring schools and accounting for progress; (4) public relations and testing; (5) testing and the curriculum; (6) testing and equity; (7) the school district testing unit; and (8) accountability and curriculum unity. Suggestions are made to better  organize and coordinate the different aspects of testing. A three-page bibliography concludes the document. (JAZ)",

        "description":"The influence of day-to-day variation in teacher performance on the reliability and validity of teacher assessment was examined. An attempt was made to identify and quantify sources of score variation attributable to differences in teacher performance, day of observation, observers, and test subscales; and to determine their effects on reliability and validity of decisions made. Data were collected from a field test of the revised Teacher Performance Assessment Instruments (TPAI). Thirty-nine seventh grade science teachers in a large Georgia school district were observed twice: (1) by two observers at the same time on the same day; and (2) by two observers on different days. Each teacher taught a two-week unit on scientific problem solving; student achievement was measured with  pretests and (the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking) and posttests (Middle Grades Integrated Process Skills Test. The estimated expected posttest score was substracted from the actual score to provide an index of teacher effectiveness. A four-facet fully-crossed design was used, including teachers, observers, day of observation, and performance indicators as sources of variation. Results suggested that additional observation time enhanced validity, and that daily variation was a greater source of error than observer differences. (GDC)",

Subjects were 192 sophomore English students from a parochial high school in Wisconsin. Both direct and indirect measures of writing ability were used. Comparisons between the IRT information functions for the three analytic raters in five different writing skill areas are also examined. Comparisons are also made with results obtained using classical test theory methodology. Results show that the plots of the IRT information functions can be used to provide valuable information about essay raters. However, correlation coefficients between the examinee IRT ability estimates  calibrated from the three sets of ratings and the standardized test separately, were found to be quite small. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed. (Author/JAZ)",

        "description":"The central question of this study was: could interventions of an affective nature be consistently applied in a controlled manner over a sufficient period of time to assure multi-dimensional growth in pre-adolescents that could be measured by a battery of instruments? The subjects of the study were two school principals, students from grades 2, 4, and 6 in the control and the experimental schools, parents of experimental classes, teachers from both experimental and control classrooms, and volunteers from the school and local community. The research lasted three to four years and components consisted of: (1) use of multidimensional measures in comparable school environments for experimental and control subjects; (2) the application of instructional materials designed to promote  personal and value development in the designated classroom; (3) the engagement of classroom teachers in inservice or professional development activities; and (4) attempts to assure collaboration as an extension of the classroom interventions. The research revealed serious weaknesses in the inability to control important variables and particularly in the inconsistency of the application of the interventions. Programs of an affective nature that claim significant causal relationships for outcome gains demand much more careful assessment. On the other hand, there is evidence that specific variables and controlled interventions can be powerful facilitators of affective growth.

        "description":"This report presents the rationale, development, and standardization of the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) Form O. The test is used to select individuals for officer commissioning programs, and candidates for pilot and navigator training. Form O contains 380 items organized in 16 subtests. All items are administered in a single test booklet, accompanied by a single machine-scorable answer sheet. Five composites, expressed as percentiles, are derived from various combinations of the subtests: Pilot, Navigator-Technical, Academic Aptitude, Verbal, and Quantitative. Although Form O contains the same composites as predecessor forms of the AFOQT, this form introduced changes in content, format, administration, and scoring. Reliabilities and intercorrelations are consistent  with those of previous forms. Form O was standardized to link scores to a normative group based on Form N data. The use of common items on Form N and Form O enabled a series of equipercentile equatings through the common items, resulting in the equating of the entire Form O battery to the entire Form N battery. Raw-score-to-percentile-score Form O composite conversion tables were developed from these equatings, and were implemented for operational use with the introduction of Form O in September 1981 at Officer Training School testing sites and in March 1982 at Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps testing sites. The data indicate the test is an appropriate replacement for Form N as a selection instrument for Air Force officers. Several tables are appended. (JAZ)",

        "description":"Issues concerning students' evaluation of college faculty are discussed. Several views of this process are presented. Having identified relevant variables or paradigms, possible relationships between the variables can be studied (models and theories). The assumptions underlying these paradigms include the following: that students have a right and an obligation to evaluate their faculty; the questionnaires are valid; faculty have a right to feedback; evaluation should be separate from diagnosis; faculty should have input concerning dissemination of results, norms, questions asked, and weighting of items; qualitative comments and other sources of data should be used; past results must be confidential; and teachers' goals should be discussed. Three paradigms are explained and  charted. The first paradigm describes the process of evaluation, identifying relevant variables (research, development, application, feedback, deliberation, and decisions). The second paradigm elaborates one of the variables--types of feedback, both evaluative and diagnostic--in terms of reviewers (students, self, peers, or administrators), and methods (papers, student achievement, interviews, observation, videotaping, questionnaires, and course syllabi). The third--on research and development--restates the first paradigm to show the progress and sequence of the evaluation process. More effort is recommended in developing procedures for all phases of the evaluation process and followup action, and in providing due process in the use of faculty evaluation data. (GDC)",

        "description":"This paper examines what rhetoric used in communicating with general audiences is appropriate to educational research as a form of knowing. Answers to this question depend not only on characteristics of knowledge, but also on what one considers a defensible goal in research reporting. Assuming that this goal is communicating authorized convictions rather than mere opinions or persuasive bias, the paper discusses standard difficulties of explaining research claims in written reports. The rhetoric of explanation is compatible with making the most of research knowledge, in a defensible way, and with bringing educational research and practice together for good purpose, namely, to educate. However, explaining research values and interests involves much more than disclosure,  explanatory writing can become too discursive, and persuasion is sometimes unavoidable as a means for helping others acquire authorized convictions. The problem is how to walk the thin line between convincing explanation and mere persuasion. (Author/JAZ)",

Canonical correlation with orthogonal rotation of composite structural components was performed in order to determine interrelationships between both sets of variables, thereby providing an integrated approach to previous research concerning subtest patterns of ability. A first rotated factor indicated a general factor with high loadings on all 11 subscales, education, race, and occupation. This factor represented &quot;crystallized&quot; intelligence or ability. A second rotated factor indicated a  performance factor with loadings on the 5 performance subscales, age, and single/marital status. This factor represented &quot;fluid&quot; intelligence or ability. A third rotated factor revealed a gender-specific or manual dexterity factor for males on the Block Design subtest and skilled worker occupation.

The implementation of the analysis procedure was intended not only to identify such groups but also to discourage school staff from engaging in student test preparation. A Chi-square based analysis was developed which compared classroom, school, and district test score distributions against empirically derived &quot;expected&quot; distributions anchored to the district median score for a given subtest. The statistical model for generating the expected distributions was built using the data from the 1983 administration. The  fit between the expected distributions created by the model and a sample of empirical observed distributions was exceptionally close. Significance levels were set, so that only groups with highly discrepant score distributions would be identified. The analysis performed in 1984 was replicated without modification in 1985. Results showed that since the analysis and related notification procedures were implemented, there has been some reduction in the number of groups exhibiting score distributions that may be associated with improper test preparation.

This paper reports the field experience provided in a doctoral program at the School of Education at Syracuse University. With the support and assistance of faculty consultants, a structured problem approach was used. Students structured their \"instrument-defined\" problem. This pre-structuring reduced practice in \"problem homesteading\" which had to be picked up with other experiences. However pre-structuring the problem had advantages in reducing the burden of faculty support and resulted in a more universally satisfactory experience for the students. Using a survey methodology allowed students to experience data gathering as well as other facets of  the process. Requiring indices introduced an understanding of some measurement problems. Requiring individual analyses allowed freedom to show considerable ingenuity, and requesting reports in journal format helped to delineate the process of doing the study from its description.

        "description":"A research and policy agenda for addressing issues related to the Hispanic worker in the United States is provided in this report, which was prepared by the Ford Foundation's Task Force on Employment and Economic Well-Being. First, the theoretical basis of the Task Force's recommendations is outlined. This was based on the observation of three trends: the historically lower social and economic characteristics of Hispanics in the United States; the restructuring of the economy (associated with the decline of manufacturing and the rise of high-tech industry); and the demographic restructuring of the labor force (which has widened the gap between high-paying, \"professional\" jobs and low-paying service jobs). Following this discussion, six recommendations are presented and discussed:  (1) research should be conducted at all appropriate sub-ethnic, regional, migration status, and industry levels (to ensure the identification of relevant problems and solutions); (2) international studies should be made of labor flows from Latin America and Mexico to the United States and their impact on the employment of American Hispanics; (3) analysis of the relationship between Hispanic workers and organized labor should be funded; (4) the abilities of the Job Partnership Training Act programs to provide employment opportunities for Hispanics in all sectors with regionally-oriented programs should be studied; (5) priority should be given to programs which encourage research on the relation of Hispanic small businesses to community development; (6) research should provide a theoretical  framework and empirical analysis of how macro- and micro-dimensions of the labor market differentially structure worker-employer outcomes. Two appendices include a list of Task Force participants and summaries of working sessions on Hispanic businesses and entrepreneurship, Hispanic immigrant labor, training and labor market discrimination, and statistical data on questions of labor market outcomes.

The top fifth of U.S. households received 42.3 percent of all after-tax income that year, a gain largely at the expense of middle income households. Since 1980 the share of national after-tax income has dropped in every income fifth except the top one. The data also show that despite growth in total net income between 1983 and 1984, typical Black, Hispanic, and female-headed households still had less than in 1980.

According to Census Bureau data, poverty, especially among children, is significantly higher than five years ago. Poverty has worsened despite decreased unemployment because of widening gaps between rich and poor. Even modest changes in distribution of income can result in large increases in poverty. Hispanics experienced the greatest poverty increase in 1985. If trends continue, they will surpass Blacks as the poorest minority within the next few years. Another trend of recent years is increasing numbers of working poor, attributable to more low-wage jobs and a minimum wage unchanged since 1981. Finally, Census data show the nation's poor farther below the poverty line than  at any time since the early 1960s except for the recession years 1982 and 1983.

It contains an account of significant developments in the history of bilingual education, an update on recent research, a plea for common understanding, ten state assessments of bilingual education over the past decade, a synopsis of testimony at eight regional hearings, and recommendations. The Council urges the Federal government to provide greater flexibility to local districts concerning methodologies of second language instruction  while still responding promptly to any violation of the constitutional rights of language minority students to quality education. More specifically, it recommends: (1) greater stress on special alternative instructional methods; (2) local level decision making concerning methodology; (3) increased funding for limited English proficiency students; (4) Federally funded research projects on better methods to identify bilingual students with special needs and training for professional staff to work with these students; (5) efforts to reduce the high dropout rate; (6) increased research and evaluation of language learning and language teaching theory; (7) improved teacher training for bilingual, English as a second language, mainstream, and special education teachers; and (8) efforts to  prevent inappropriate placement of students in special education programs. Appendixes include the Department of Education budgets for bilingual education for 1985 and 1986; data on language characteristics of the U.S. population by state and age for 1980; data on home speakers of Spanish in the United States for 1980; a copy of the NACCBE Charter, and a paper reporting the personal views of five Council members.

The hearing was held in Massachusetts, a state leading in forging linkages between policy and economic objectives among state, Federal, and local governments; the private sector; and educational systems. JTPA has been a critical factor in Massachusetts' ability to develop innovative job training and skills training programs, and consequently, to revitalize its economy. Testimonies supported this assertion and also discussed: (1) JTPA as a vehicle for coordinating and consolidating a variety of employment,  training and educational services; (2) using the JTPA infrastructure to build a new job training system which would offer remediation, training, retraining, skill upgrading and job placement; (3) the ill effects of the Gramm-Rudman amendment and the substate allocation formula; and (4) suggestions for strengthening the ability of local and regional delivery systems to target their services to the neediest.

The report, using fiscal year 1984 as a baseline, discusses in detail the budgetary impact of immigration on State and local governments. Major federal immigrant-related outlays and revenues for that period are identified and/or estimated. These data are then projected to yield 1990 and 1995 estimates under three different sets of scenarios as to the future social, economic, and political environment. Similar data for selected programs and localities in the five most impacted States are presented for illustrative purpose--no projections were made at this level. The analysis demonstrates that significant budgetary impacts of immigration exist at the Federal level, in terms both of  outlays and revenues. For fiscal year 1984, in the programs examined: (1) per capita Federal outlays for immigrants were roughly comparable to those for average United States residents; (2) per capita, immigrants contributed fewer revenues to the Federal government than average United States residents; and (3) total immigrant-related outlays differed only slightly from total immigrant-related revenues. Under all three scenarios examined, these observations remain valid for 1990 and 1995, although uncertainty increases. A glossary is included. (KH)",

Data are from the program year beginning July 1, 1984. Information is presented on: (1) the costs, job placements, and starting wages for youth after receiving training; and (2) the nature and extent of public service activities performed by the CCCs and comparably sized Job Corps centers that are administered under competitive contract. The review included 29 of 30 CCCs and 13 centers administered under competitive contract with the Department of Labor. In summary, it was found that the annual per-person costs are higher at CCCs than at contract centers.  However, youth who receive training at CCCs are more likely to be placed than youth who receive training at contract centers. Youth who obtain employment after training at CCCs are paid higher starting wages than youth trained at contract centers. Cost differences were found to be due mainly to the types of training provided. Also, residential living costs at CCCs are more expensive than at contract centers due to wages and higher food costs.

Among the responses to this problem was the promotion at the national, State, and local levels of an intervention model linking education, social, and health services for pregnant and parenting teenagers. This study addresses: (1) how and why local programs for pregnant and parenting adolescents have been developed and maintained, and (2) what accounts for the development and maintenance of comprehensive programs in some communities and not in others that appear equally or more needy. Four states were selected for study: Massachusetts, Michigan, California, and Tennessee. Within each state a pair of localities were chosen (two in California) making a total of five pairs matched  according to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Each pair included one locality with a comprehensive program and one without. Programs were evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) leadership, (2) knowledge of alternative program models, (3) State funds, (4) policies and technical assistance, (5) advocacy group and interest group activities, and (6) State and local political culture. After an overview describing the purpose and design of the study, including a definition of the term \"comprehensive,\" State and local case studies are presented for each of the ten localities. Finally, the book addresses the concept and constraints of comprehensive services, discusses conditions and strategies for successful program initiation and maintenance, and offers recommendations.

Hispanics, Blacks, and economically and educationally disadvantaged youth have a much higher dropout rate, as do those who are (1) pregnant, (2) two or more years behind grade level, and (3) from homes where the fathers dropped out. Within the first several years after dropping out, about 50 percent return to school or enroll in General Education Development programs. Labor market opportunities are poor for youth who have not completed high school and are worse for Blacks than for Whites. Due  to limitations on available data and research, it is not generally known &quot;what works&quot; to prevent youth from dropping out of school or to encourage their return.

One involved a job search requirement, while the other combined that requirement with a short-term work obligation. Overall, compared to the few earlier studies on similar approaches, the results are favorable. The San Diego programs successfully implemented a short-term participation requirement for new applicants to welfare. For applicants to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (ADFC)--mainly female single parents who constitute a majority of the welfare caseload--both programs increased employment and proved cost-effective for both the applicants and taxpayers. The programs were particularly  effective for individuals often ignored by employment and training programs: those whose characteristics define them as difficult to employ. For the AFDC-U applicants--primarily men from two-parent households--the results are mixed. Both programs substantially reduced welfare costs but did not increase employment significantly, with the result that taxpayers gained but the welfare applicants did not. These findings offer valuable evidence on the potential and limits of job search and work experience in increasing employment and reducing welfare dependency. Five appendices provide supplementary tables, information on related data collection studies, data sources, and a bibliography. (KH)",

Sixteen- to 19-year-olds from low income or welfare households who had not yet graduated from high school were offered minimum-wage jobs, part-time during the school year and full-time during the summer, on the condition that they remain in or return to school and meet academic and job performance standards. This report highlights key findings from studies focused on the period of YIEPP's operations and discusses the demonstration's post-program period. Issues discussed include the following: (1) successful delivery of the job guarantee; (2) the role of the private sector; (3) high  participation rates confirming disadvantaged youths' interest in work; (4) increases in employment and earnings during the program which continued after operations ceased; and (5) the absence of any significant impact on school enrollment, graduation, or dropout rates. Related to this last issue is the conclusion that many youths need more than what YIEPP and traditional education can offer. For many youths, however, the program worked. YIEPP showed that the employment deficit is not of the youths' making; the shortage is jobs, not motivation. (LHW)",

        "description":"Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) analyzes graduation and attrition rates of the 1982 graduating class from the district's 49 regular high schools as well as from continuation, opportunity, special education, and alternative and magnet schools. Graduates are senior high school students who earned a diploma, or passed the California High School Proficiency Examination. Statistics are based on the number of students who entered tenth grade in September 1979. This number was then adjusted for additional entrants and leavers over 3 years, yielding the June 1982 graduation rate and attrition rate. Attrition accounts for all former members of the class who left before graduating. Attrition totals included dropouts, but should not be construed as representing a dropout rate.  The graduation rate for the 1982 class was 58%, an increase over 1981, and the attrition rate 42%, which is less than in 1981. Historical data show an increase in the number of graduates each year from 1967 to 1972, and then a decline. Budget Division reports from 1971, 1977, 1979, and 1980 also show a drop in the number of graduates. A factor apparently influencing this decrease was the curtailment of summer school programs.

        "description":"Students who left school entirely during the 1984-85 school year, and others who withdrew from regular school and subsequently returned to the district's High School Diploma Program (HSDP), completed questionnaires providing information about their educational values, reasons for leaving school, perceptions of their academic abilities, relationships with school, and peer and support relationships. The returners were also asked their opinions of the HSDP and how the program compared with their previous regular school. The study found that: (1) leavers and returners are less certain of their motivation to learn and their ability to graduate; (2) attendance problems, lack of interest and boredom were the most frequently cited factors in their decision to leave; (3) though the  parents' commitment to learning was questionable, academically-related experiences were the dominant factors in students' decisions to leave school; and (4) returners liked the HSDP administrative arrangements and educational characteristics. The authors developed an educational empowerment theory that a student's image of school as a place to be successful determines the student's persistence. The authors recommend changes in the educational philosophy and actions of the school to create a structure and curriculum that addresses everyone's need for success, approval, challenge, and meaning.

After an introduction, the report covers issues relevant to the study which have been addressed in two bodies of scholarly literature: (1) educational literature  that tries to account for school successes and failures of Afro-American children, and (2) educational literature that addresses family decisions and school choice within the context of American society. In later chapters, the report discusses in detail the design of the study and gives findings and summaries. Due to the extensive scope of the research, findings are presented and summarized by area of inquiry, with no explicit attempt to link these findings to the overall aims and purposes of the study. A final chapter offers policy recommendations, and discusses research implications for black families, private schools, and family school relations. A 17-page list of references; a coding manual for parental education goals; a paper on conducting fieldwork in multiracial, multiethnic,  urban private schools; a field manual for school observations; and the questionnaires used for parent, administrator, school, and parent leader interviews are appended.

        "description":"\"Lifelong learning\" often has the connotation of \"lifelong schooling,\" an activity planned and organized by specialists for others. In contrast, \"lifelong learning\" can be understood as the description of a continuous life process, including not only formal and self-directed intentional learning, but also unintentional, but nevertheless important and effective learning. Adult educators must face the reality of this learning and widen their concept of learning. \"Lifelong learning\" should not, therefore, be used as an activist's banner for getting people into classes. Professionals in adult education should recognize that they cannot set themselves up as the \"gurus\" of learning, thereby making students dependent on them. Rather, adult educators must accept that learning is the  students' business, and face the reality that all people learn lifelong, with or without educators and programs. This approach to the perception of learning offers a wider range of understanding and intervention. Reflecting on this wide concept of learning helps adult educators in formal settings to take off the professional blinders that focus their attention on the teaching activity through which they can impose their will, knowledge, or skill upon others. Observing thoroughly the learning of adults will lead to a truly mature \"adult\" education, a shift in emphasis from teaching to learning. (KC)",

        "description":"While volunteers are important for Cooperative Extension Services, Extension agents encounter problems in the training of volunteers, the supervision of volunteers, and the completion of reports on volunteers. The use of middle management level volunteer coordinators can alleviate these problems. Extension agents can train their best volunteers as coordinators and trainers of other volunteers. In addition to their work with the Extension Service, volunteer coordinators can assist other local agencies in the community. The Extension Service is an appropriate agency to develop volunteerism at the local level for several reasons. It is associated with different community groups and activities and has established itself as a resource for educational opportunities and information.  Extension agents have proven their leadership skills by planning and implementing programs in the local community and have established expertise by working with millions of volunteers. Not only do volunteer coordinators assist the local Extension agent with community development, but they may also increase the total number of volunteers available to the extension service. (YLB)",

        "description":"Traditionally, disabled persons have received vocational training in sheltered workshops and after evaluation have been placed into work activity, extended sheltered employment, or transitional employment programs. Transition then to competitive employment is atypical for persons with severe disabilities. Their employment situation has improved recently due to development of competitive employment programs or supported work models of competitive employment. Supported work relates to the use of new, improved practices that have been shown to be effective in competitively employing persons with severe disabilities. Components of the supported work approach are assessment of work behavior, job identification, placement, training, and maintenance and generalization. A local provider  in Illinois has offered supported work programs (food service and janitorial services). Of the 134 persons who have participated, 43 percent have been multiply handicapped and 108 have completed training and been placed on jobs in the community. This supported work program is funded primarily by federal and state monies distributed at the local level. Two agencies involved are the Department of Rehabilitation Services and Job Training Partnership Act agencies. Personnel preparation programs at the preservice and inservice levels need to incorporate the practices developed in model demonstration programs. A model curriculum should be competency-based, field-based, and behaviorally grounded; include community-referenced curriculum development; and provide a focus on transition skills.  (YLB)",

        "description":"The work experience and income of male veterans, aged 20 years and over, were compared with that of their nonveteran counterparts for the calendar year 1981. Analysis of the data provided by the Census Bureau showed that a larger percentage of male veterans than of their nonveteran counterparts, 64 percent and 56 percent, respectively, worked full-time all year round during 1981. As a result, veterans had a higher overall median income than nonveterans. Age differences between the two groups, however, accounted for much of this disparity in income and work experience. Veterans comprised an older group than nonveterans, and consequently fewer of them were at the ages that are at greatest risk of being totally or partly unemployed during the year.

The Pennsylvania State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee has developed an Occupational Information System (OIS) and companion microcomputer version (Micro-OIS). This system contains data on the demand for workers (a prediction of annual anticipated job openings for specific occupations) and supply of workers (actual data from completers of formal training programs). To use this information, educational planners need to understand the structure of the published data. Program planning starts with an inventory of students. The educational planner can then take an inventory of the universe of occupations including the  employers who provide the work. This occupational inventory of local employment options must include specific information on employers, recruitment methods, worker skills, and the way to learn these skills. Finally, the planner needs to take an inventory of the universe of educational programs including resources available to be committed to educational programs.

Findings indicated that the female veteran population was relatively young with over half entering the service since the beginning of the Vietnam era. Very few women veterans (1 percent) completed a 20-year career with military retirement. Veterans of the Vietnam and post-Vietnam eras were more likely than veterans of earlier periods to report readjustment problems. The vast majority reported they were in good or excellent health. Women veterans had made use of a range of programs and benefits  administered by the VA. The low rate of usage of VA programs by women veterans seemed to reflect a problem of benefit awareness rather than preference. Lower rates of utilization of VA hospitals by women veterans compared to male veterans were found. Need and perceived eligibility appeared to be factors that most influenced their decision to seek care in VA hospitals. Anticipated future usage of VA facilities and programs was somewhat higher than current usage. (Extensive tables are included. The survey is appended.) (YLB)",

Findings indicated veterans had a higher educational level and were less likely to be at the lower end of the occupational scale than non-veterans of the same age. Retired veterans were substantially better off. Three-fourths had savings accounts, 42 percent had other investments, and nearly 9 out of 10 owned their own home. Although the majority described their health as excellent or good compared to others their own age, nearly half reported that their health limited their activities. Certain types of chronic diseases, including arthritis and  hypertension, were widespread. While four of five veterans had group or private health insurance, Medicare formed the cornerstone of the aging veterans' health coverage. The survey identified, however, the existence of a medically indigent group of veterans. Most veterans did not believe they would be able to absorb the cost of future long-term care needs. An important finding was that current utilization rates of VA hospitals by aging veterans may drastically underrepresent the true demand. (Numerous data tables are provided.

The competencies upon which these modules are based were identified and verified through research as being important to successful vocational teaching at both the secondary and postsecondary levels of instruction. This module is designed to prepare prospective or inservice teachers to teach by the project method, a method that involves a series of carefully planned projects or a single major project designed to be the focal point for all instruction and instructional planning. The module is intended to assist vocational-technical teachers in determining (1) how this method applies to their occupational area,  and (2) what their role should be in implementing this method. Finally, the module is designed to help teachers plan and implement the project method effectively. This module contains three learning experiences to allow students to gain experience in the project method. Each learning experience contains an enabling objective, activities, optional activities, and self-check with answers. The final learning experience requires students to employ the project method in an actual teaching situation and be assessed by a resource person.

In all cases, there were GED holders with high school and above reading levels as well as substantial numbers who could not read at a high school level. A review of the performance of all GED holders who entered the 13 universities of the University of Wisconsin system found that GED holders had serious retention problems and few graduated. The performance and graduation rate of GED holders at MATC were similar to those of high school dropouts. Admissions  officers at postsecondary institutions were usually satisfied with the preparation of GED holders who met other requirements. A survey of Wisconsin employers indicates that the GED credential is well received and considered by most to be equivalent to a high school diploma. Six changes in GED policy were recommended, including raising the minimum age for testing to 18.5 years, requiring GED applicants to demonstrate 10th-grade reading and mathematics skills, and developing a &quot;second chance&quot; diploma for high school noncompleters.

Data were collected from a sample of 300 adult 4-H volunteers in Ohio through a mailed questionnaire; a response rate of 72 percent was achieved. The study found that the social background factors positively associated with continued participation were (1) having children in 4-H and (2) having a spouse as a leader. Previous experience as a 4-H member was negatively associated with continued participation. Age, length of residence in the community, and number of children under the age of 9 years were positively associated with a leader's  length of service. Number of children ages 12-14 was negatively associated with length of service, suggesting that as a leader's children leave the program, the leader stops serving. Homemakers contributed more hours of service than persons in other categories. Several attitudinal factors, such as attractiveness of 4-H, perceived instrumental value of the leader, flexibility, and influence of significant others, were all positive for involvement in 4-H. Finally, the study determined that a leader's length of service increased if he/she were older, had a spouse as a leader, had children in 4-H, was not a laborer, and perceived 4-H as having something to offer the leader personally. The study recommended that further research be conducted on additional attitudinal and personality factors  that may influence volunteering, and investigate why the relationships found in this study, such as previous members failing to volunteer, occur.

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare 4-H agent, volunteer leader, and teenage member perceptions concerning the importance of selected leadership activities for teenage 4-H members, and the extent to which teenagers should be involved in carrying out these leadership activities. Data were gathered from a sample of 200 teenage 4-H members, 200 volunteer leaders, and the total population of 88 Ohio 4-H agents. Analysis of data revealed the following: (1) 4-H agent, volunteer leader, and teenage member perceptions of importance and involvement differ for certain teenage leadership activities; (2) because agent and member ratings of leadership activities differ more often than leader and member ratings, one can conclude that volunteer leaders and teenage members are more closely aligned  on their perception of appropriate teenage leadership activities than are agents and members; (3) volunteer leaders and teenage members tend to rate club-centered leadership activities higher on importance and involvement while 4-H agents tend to rate county-centered leadership activities higher; (4) teenage members are as concerned as volunteer leaders with helping 4-H club members make money for the 4-H club and seeing that members participate in the county fair; and (5) teenage members are not as concerned as 4-H agents with assisting in the planning of the county's summer camp programs. The study recommended that 4-H agents reexamine their emphasis on particular teenage leadership activities and that agents shoud consider members' preferences for more club-centered activities and be  aware of the differences between teen and adult leader perceptions. The study also recommended evaluation of leadership activities perceived as important by teenage members. (KC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the type and scope of supervised occupational experience programs (SOEPs) and the achievement of students mainstreamed in vocational agriculture in Ohio. Achievement was measured by the grade students received in vocational agriculture during the first semester of the 1983-84 school year. The sample for the study was 300 randomly selected handicapped vocational agriculture students from comprehensive high schools, joint vocational schools, and city vocational schools. Data were gathered by means of a questionnaire administered to the students by their 82 vocational agriculture teachers. The study found that students with more hours of in-school laboratory SOEPs had greater achievement than students with fewer hours. However, there was no  relationship between the scope of out-of-school SOEPs and student achievement and no relationship between the level of student achievement and type of school, type of handicap, length of students' enrollment in vocational agriculture, or number of siblings enrolled in vocational agriculture. The study found a positive relationship between the level of student achievement and Future Farmers of America involvement, and between achievement and student opportunity variable (living in a town or city, encouragement, living with one parent, and occupational status of parents). The study also found a negative relationship between the level of student achievement and some student opportunity variables (living with a guardian, money provided by parents, participation in free or reduced-price lunch  program, and living in a nonfarm rural residence). The study recommended increased use of in-school laboratory projects for handicapped students. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to explore why students in Ohio enter three selected taxonomy areas of vocational agriculture and to describe their attributes and vocational objectives. From a sample of 180 11th- and 12-th grade students, the study gathered data about vocational objectives and factors that motivated students to enroll in agricultural mechanics, horticulture, and production agriculture programs. The study found the following: (1) more than 90 percent of the agricultural mechanics students intend to pursue a career in a field related to their studies, while only about 50 percent of horticulture students and production agriculture students intend to pursue a vocational objective related to their field; (2) motivator statements are not a good predictor of the enrollment area  of students; (3) the average agricultural mechanics student was a male junior, age 17, who lived on 1-10 acres in a rural area, had blue-collar parents, held a job related to area of enrollment, was a member of the Future Farmers of America (FFA), and ranked in the middle one-third of the class; (4) the average horticulture student was a female senior, 17, lived in the city on less than one acre, had an unrelated job, had blue-collar parents, belonged to FFA, and ranked in the middle one-third of the class; (5) the average production agriculture student was a male senior, age 17, lived on a farm of more than 100 acres, had blue-collar parents, belonged to FFA and ranked in the middle one-third of the class; and (6) demographic characteristics are not good predictors of students'  vocational objectives, nor of motivators for students to enroll in vocational agriculture. The study concluded that more care should be taken to encourage students with a real interest in vocational agriculture to enroll in such programs. It also showed that placement rates are unfair indicators of success of vocational agriculture programs because many students enroll in these programs who do not have a vocational objective in agriculture.

Information on the demographic characteristics of urban Extension employees in the state was also gathered. Data were obtained via a two-part questionnaire mailed to the 46 Extension employees working in the urban areas of the state; response was 100 percent. The study found that Extension employees perceived that competency in organizational skills was the highest priority, with competency in communication skills a close second. Competency in research and evaluation received the lowest priority rating. Program planning and development was the highest ranked subcategory, while effective thinking, program execution, and public relations were the  lowest ranked subcategories. No very high or substantial correlations were found between the competency categories, subcategories, and the demographic characteristics of the Extension employees. The study recommended that the curriculum in agricultural education at Ohio State University should take into consideration the career plans of future Extension employees who may work in an urban environment and that organization skills and urban planning and development competencies should be taught in classes. The study also recommended that Extension's program developers and policymakers should consider these findings when developing urban programs and policies. (KC)",

These skills were believed to be transferable to the workplace and to increase the productivity of the individual to the benefit of society. For girls, the vocational preparation was more vocationally specific and trained them in skills transferable immediately to the work force. Girls were encouraged to make curriculum choices within the limited number of occupational positions and societal roles regarded as suitable for women. Job-specific training was complementary to the overall ideology of domesticity by providing skills for short-term employment prior to marriage. Development of  commercial education in the state system opened up clerical work to the increasing number of youth staying on at school. The rapid expansion of secondary education facilitated the upward social mobility of the middle class. Young workers also benefitted from the salary rises and increased opportunities for advancement in what was considered higher status white-collar work. (YLB)",

In the first chapter, the contemporary conditions that have spawned a renewed interest in the concept of community education are contrasted with the conditions that initiated the movement 25 years ago. The second chapter, which examines community education as a program, discusses the following topics: the components of community education programs (needs assessment, leadership, community involvement, physical facilities, participants, and instructors/leaders); steps in program development (assessment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and reassessment); and community education programs that are currently being offered in four cities (Flint, Michigan; Austin, Texas; York, Nebraska; and Elk River,  Minnesota). Community education is viewed in terms of a process, i.e., the structure, procedures and intent of interaction among individuals, organizations, agencies, and institutions in a community. Programs which serve as good examples of process are reviewed in the following areas: Birmingham, Michigan; School District No. 2 in New York City; and Independence, Missouri. The potential pitfalls and benefits of community education are outlined in the final chapter. A 13-item bibliography concludes the fastback. (MN)",

Two major resources were updated and improved in 1985: the crosswalk or cross-coding instrument and materials and procedures to help states relate data on labor supply from training institutions to data on employment demand in related occupations. NOICC continued to cooperate with state and federal agencies and other organizations to improve the OIS database. It has provided financial and  technical assistance to help states implement computerized systems. NOICC findings of June 1986 indicate 37 states will have a microcomputer-based system; 25 are already in operation. NOICC supported development of a Micro-OIS and provided grants for its implementation in 26 states. NOICC has promoted the development of statewide career information delivery systems; 42 states have computer-based statewide systems, 21 launched with incentive grants from NOICC.

The facilitating factors identified were employment-related motivators, financial asistance and improvement, institutional information and services, institutional characteristics, personal motivators, and encouragement from others. Factors found to impede reentry into postsecondary education included financial difficulties, lack of information and services, confusion and unfamiliarity with institutional proceses,  apprehensions about self, the necessity of handling multiple responsibilities, and time management concerns. The following were deemed the most important in enhancing students' desire and commitment to return to postsecondary education: an orientation program and orientation course components, a staff development program, a community resources component/educational planning resource center, reading level analysis of instructional materials, and a progress monitoring system.

        "description":"A study examined the training required for a wide range of occupations in which workers use computers or computer-controlled equipment. It was determined that although computer use is widespread and growing rapidly, relatively few workers (about 5 percent) need extensive education or training in computer-related skills. Because most workers involved with computers use them as tools in their jobs and work primarily with already-prepared computer software, they can learn computer-related skills in brief on-the-job training ranging anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks. Thus, it would appear that young workers need not fear being frozen out of the job market because they have not learned about computers. Because the computer skills required are, in most occupations, only a small  part of the total work skills, the trend toward ever-increasing use of computers in the workplace will not impose correspondingly large demands on the education and training system. Schools already appear to be teaching word processing and electronic and computer technology effectively. Based on the finding that not more than two percent of all workers need to be able to program computers, it would seem that the inclusion of training in computer programming in general computer literacy studies could only be justified on general education grounds. Two areas where the schools do have an important role to play, however, are in offering vocational guidance and counseling in the area of computer-related occupations and retraining displaced workers in a broad spectrum of skill areas that  includes but is not limited to computer-related skills.

        "description":"A study was undertaken to identify the different ways and the extent to which microcomputers are being used in secondary health occupations education (HOE) programs, the amount and types of applicable software and level of support for microcomputer-based HOE, and available literature reflecting or supporting the development of computer-assisted instruction in HOE. Data were collected from a literature review and surveys of 180 vendors of microcomputers and related courseware and 150 teachers and 35 supervisors of HOE programs. It was discovered that although commercially produced software that is appropriate for use in secondary HOE programs does exist, the selection is quite limited. Commercial educational software developers were largely unaware of the existence of a need for  HOE courseware, and most HOE teachers surveyed were unaware of the magnitude of the software gap that exists in HOE. No single commercial software development company whose primary focus was HOE software was found. Drill-and-practice software was used most frequently, whereas simulation courseware (the one that appeared to be the most effective) was the least used and least available. Only 1 in 10 teachers surveyed was using microcomputers in an HOE program. (This report includes a taxonomy of microcomputer software for HOE teachers, a 67-item reference list, and appendixes containing the letter sent to vendors to solicit information for the study and the teacher and supervisor survey instruments.)

        "description":"Designing instruction for trainees from abroad is very different from creating similar programs for trainees from the United States. Prescriptions based on these differences should be used with a chosen instructional design model when adapting training designs for other cultures. Instructional design principles apply to instruction for learners from other cultures if the teacher challenges his/her assumptions about the learners. First, a needs analysis should be conducted before training is exported. This includes asking if technology is appropriate to the situation and asking if the objectives are the same. Next, in addition to standard audience analysis, the teacher must give added scrutiny to motivational factors, the level of English comprehension, entry skills and knowledge,  and learning style preferences. Based on these analyses, the teacher should examine any existing training materials to determine if delivery methods and instructional strategies are appropriate. Needed revisions must be made. If the instructor is not from the same culture as the students, his or her training should include culture-specific and culture-general training in addition to content training. The course should then be evaluated during a pilot session and revised on the bases of the evaluation. (KC)",

        "description":"The role of the social network in adjustment takes on greater significance during the aftermath of divorce because of the many changes these networks undergo as a result of divorce. For most children of divorce, the father-child relationship changes dramatically and thus transactions within this relationship may be particularly impactful. This study examined the type of support children who reside primarily with their mothers received from fathers. Subjects (n=110) were children whose parents had divorced within the past 30 months. Children reported on the social support and interparental conflict they had experienced during the 3 months prior to the interview. Five categories of supportive transactions were measured: recreation, advice, goods and services, emotional support, and  positive feedback. The results revealed that fathers played a relatively minor role in children's support networks. One-sixth of the children did not list fathers as providing any support. Forty percent had not received advice from fathers and most fathers had not provided emotional support. Mothers had provided significantly more support than fathers. Fathers' support was correlated positively with children's self-esteem. Provision of goods and services and positive feedback were especially important types of support. Higher levels of interparental conflict were significantly associated with children's symptomatology of depression, hostility, and anxiety. Enhancing the father-child relationship and diminishing acrimony between the divorcing couple might be important components of  intervention programs. (ABL)",

Women are often segregated into lower paying jobs because of stereotypical views about what is natural for women to do. Despite equal pay laws, Chinese women earn only 71.7% of what men earn. Physiological differences between men and women have been used as justification for certain protections in the workplace such as maternity leave. These protections, however, make women less desirable employees. Although the government has attempted to achieve equality for women through economic emancipation, a viable feminist theory has not been implemented. Chinese women have  achieved success in professional occupations such as medicine, they are portrayed favorably in the media, and they are provided mentor role models by the Women's Federation. Masculinity and femininity are both valued in China and thus women's contributions to management are recognized. The similarities between Chinese managers and North American women managers warrants investigation. (ABL)",

        "description":"For homeless children, assuming responsibility for their own survival is an act of self-empowerment. However, society tends to see these children as victims to be rescued, delinquents who need to be disciplined, or else they are ignored. These views deny the resourcefulness of children who survive under these conditions. A study was conducted of homeless children of Bogota, Colombia with the goal of mutual empowerment of both the researchers and the children instead of disempowerment of the children. Tyler's psychosocial competence configuration was used as a framework for developing a structured interview to measure children's sense of self-efficacy, trust, and active planfulness in their different life contexts of homes, institutions, and streets. The interview was administered  by street workers over a period of 2 years to 144 children (129 boys and 15 girls), 101 of whom were under 18. Results of the study included the following: (1) reasons for leaving home included abuse, excessive discipline, family problems, parental death, poverty, and search for adventure; (2) institutions were appreciated for their ability to meet basic needs but disliked for discipline, violence, and abuse; (3) children survived by stealing, begging, and joining groups; and (4) children primarily wished for work and money to help others and for a home. Implications of this research include social policy changes to prevent family abuse and the need for agencies to support street children, capitalizing on their strengths. (ABL)",

        "description":"It is widely agreed that counselors' and clients' values influence every phase of psychotherapy. A preliminary appraisal of the usefulness of multidimensional scaling (MDS) for investigating the effects of values on counseling process and outcome was done. MDS was used to investigate how theistic or atheistic values of a counselor, when revealed, influenced 49 religious psychotherapy clients' and 51 religious leaders' trust of the counselor. Clients were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota, receiving psychotherapy at a Mormon counseling clinic. The non-client subjects were not receiving counseling at the clinic and were serving in non-paid leadership positions in local congregations of the Mormon church. The  analysis revealed that: (1) values of atheistic counselors inspired client distrust; (2) a counselor who believed in God inspired the most client trust while a counselor who didn't believe in God inspired the most distrust; (3) client trust was not one-dimensional, there appeared to be both orthodox and unorthodox trust dimensions; and (4) religious leaders were more orthodox in their trust, or more theistically oriented in their values, than were the clients. MDS might be used to investigate other current value issues in counseling. This preliminary appraisal of MDS suggests that it has potential as a methodological tool in this research area.

Little is known about social work services in for-profit organizations or about how they compare to similar non-profit settings. A comparative study was conducted of social work services in proprietary and non-profit hospitals which used the results of the 1985 Membership Survey of The Society for Hospital Social Work Directors and a sample of 50 proprietary hospital social work departments. Differences and similarities in the areas of services and staffing, work settings, characteristics of directors, and changes since the advent of the Diagnostically Related Groupings (DRG's) were examined for non-profit and for-profit groups. The proprietary sample  also described changes since DRG's in the areas of discharge planning, direct patient services, administrative responsibilities, new program development, and fiscal support. The results revealed that proprietary hospitals, in contrast to non-profit institutions, were often located in suburban areas, were part of a multi-hospital system, and were small in size. The proprietary hospital social work departments and those non-profits sampled by the Society for Hospital Social Work Directors were found to be different in size and type of staff. Several differences were also revealed in the kinds of services provided by proprietary and non-profit hospitals. The findings suggest several implications for both social work and health care.

        "description":"This paper presents four major features of L. S. Vygotsky's theory of creative imagination. The first feature discussed is that imagination is the internalization of children's play. It is explained that the development of imagination parallels the development of speech which originates in the child's social dialogue with adults, passes through an egocentric phase, and is internalized as inner speech. This inner speech is credited with allowing for an individual's self-consciousness and self-regulation. Finally it is explained that, at age 7 years, the imagination no longer requires external supports and becomes an integral mental function, a consciously directed thought process learned through collective social interactions. It is explained that imagination may serve either  personal wish fulfillment or be used in creative problem solving in art and science. The third Vygotskian feature discussed is that a convergence between imagination and thinking in concepts occurs during adolescence and matures in the creative thinking of the adult. The fourth and final Vygotskian feature considered is that both artistic and scientific creativity require the collaboration of imagination and thinking in concepts. (NB)",

        "description":"Numerous theories of depression have been proposed and tested with several variables being implicated in the etiology of unipolar depression in the last 15 years. The time has come for unification and integration of recent depression research. Four characteristics of the preunified theory of depression include: (1) failure of researchers to relate their findings to the existing knowledge base resulting in a less than optimum cross-fertilization of specialties of psychology; (2) the premature abandonment of hypotheses which fail to account for all cases of depression; (3) unnecessary restriction of theory and research approaches to particular methodologies; and (4) failure of many theorists to acknowledge the similarity of their ideas to the contributions of others. A paradigmatic  behavioral theory of depression promotes an integrative, unifying paradigm of our knowledge of depression. This theory is designed to encourage an end to fragmentation by its integrative and not eclectic nature. Determinants of depression are proposed which can be understood within the context of well-established principles of classical and operant conditioning. As a base for this theory, a philosophy of science entitled unified positivism is employed. The evaluation of this paradigmatic behavioral theory of depression has just begun, but continuing research is planned. (ABL)",

        "description":"It has become recognized that major health problems are caused, precipitated, exacerbated, or maintained by lifestyle factors such as exercise, diet, and consumption of psychoactive substances. The introduction of complex behavior change into the medical prescription for health promotion and disease prevention has resulted in a large body of research demonstrating that the rates of compliance have been inadequate. Three models of compliance appearing recently in the literature include radical behavioral, cognitive, and cognitive-behavioral models. Although the cognitive-behavioral model is the most comprehensive of the three, it fails to integrate variables related to compliance to other known principles of behavior so that few predictions can be made from this model. However,  development of this model into a paradigmatic behavioral theory may permit the generation of more specific hypotheses and thereby encourage the unification of our understanding of the causes of compliance and noncompliance to health care. This paradigmatic behavioral theory approaches the problem of compliance as a function of past learning experiences which have resulted in personality deficits, current antecedents to the compliant behavior, and current consequences, which in turn affect the adequacy of the personality repertoires.

This study investigated this claim of a relationship between predicate matching and understanding. Three scripts were developed and tape-recorded depicting a college-aged male reporting on an early childhood experience. The content of each script was identical except for the sensory predicates used to describe the experience. One script contained visual predicates, one contained kinesthetic predicates, and one contained auditory predicates. Male college students (N=99) served as  subjects. Each subject's PRS was determined by two independent raters on the basis of the verbal predicates used by the subject in a structured interview. Subjects then listened to a tape-recorded script under either a matched or a mismatched experimental condition. Following the script, subjects completed three questionnaires which assessed their objective understanding (factual recall) and subjective understanding (feelings of having understood). No significant main effect was found for matching on any of the dependent measures. The results weakly supported a claim of enhanced accuracy of understanding on one measure of objective understanding. (NB)",

        "description":"A major demonstration and evaluation project was undertaken to study the consequences of using incentive payments to change admission, discharge, and outcome patterns for Medicaid patients in nursing homes. Thirty-six proprietary, Medicaid-certified, skilled nursing homes in San Diego County with a combined Medicaid inpatient census of approximately 3,600 residents participated. Baseline data were collected from November 1980 through April 1981. Homes were then assigned to either a control group or a treatment group. During the next two years, an incentive reimbursement system was employed in paying for care in nursing homes in the treatment group. The results of the outcome-incentive component of the study revealed no statistically significant differences in patient outcomes, as  measured by goal achievement, between treatment and control facilities. There was no evidence that goal-related reimbursement incentives improved patient outcomes. The results do suggest that goals related to clearly defined conditions are the ones most likely to improve patient outcomes. Incentive reimbursement may still prove effective if it is limited to certain clearly delineated conditions. If this is true, incentive reimbursement could be used to supplement rather than replace other approaches to quality assurance in nursing homes. (NB)",

        "description":"A job evaluation system was designed and implemented by a college's personnel department using a &quot;point dash factor&quot; method for evaluating jobs. Employees made the major decision about which criteria should be used to rate job difficulty and how much weight each criterion should carry. Employee input was solicited through committees formed around occupations, a resolution committee comprised of representatives of the occupational committees, and a general mail survey of employees. After committees had formulated criteria, the criteria were further evaluated for bias, usefulness, and validity. The selected criteria were assigned to nine clusters and then submitted to the employees for weighting. Ratings assigned by the employees were then subjected to further reliability and  validity tests including the measure of correlation to current salary grade. Results of the job evaluation procedure were then used to determine if pay inequities existed between female-dominated jobs and male-dominated jobs of similar difficulty. This was necessary in order to comply with state law. Although many female-dominated jobs were underpaid, others were not. Some male-dominated jobs were also not paid equitably. Salary adjustments will be made according to these guidelines with a supplementary procedure being used for documented recurring problems due to new lower salary ranges. The new point system will be used for classifying new jobs and reclassifying old ones. (ABL)",

        "description":"Effective psychotherapy supervision calls for a variety of supervisory roles and addresses a range of student needs. The particular student need should be the determining factor in selecting an appropriate supervisory role. The supervisor needs a range of role alternatives, a framework in which to fit student needs, a specified area of focus during supervision, and systematic guidelines for determining supervisory goals and approaches. The unique Professional Model of psychotherapy supervision specifies the manner in which supervision is provided. The Professional Model is a three-dimensional model integrating supervisory roles and student need areas. The three dimensions are: (1) the primary areas of student need in the establishment of clinical skills; (2) a reflection of the  various roles supervisors assume; and (3) the focus of attention during supervision. In the Professional Model the supervisor and student agree on the primary dimension. In this format, supervisor and student exchange personal and professional information, student's strengths and weaknesses are assessed, and a psychotherapy skills checklist is completed by the student. After these procedures a contract, called the Individualized Training Plan, is developed for supervisor and student. It outlines student needs and objectives with training strategies. An Individualized Training Review detailing progress by the student is recommended at least once every 90 days. Thus the student's progress is charted through plans and reviews. (ABL)",

The document opens with the actual text of the amendment. A section on the background of current federal rape law discusses the crime of rape as primarily a state, not federal, law enforcement problem and reviews the history of the definition of rape and its current meaning in federal law. The intent of the legislation is described in these points: (1) defining offenses in gender-neutral terms; (2) defining offenses so that a trial focuses on the conduct of the defendant, instead of the conduct of the victim; (3) expanding the offenses to reach all forms of sexual abuse; (4) abandoning the doctrines of  resistance and spousal immunity; and (5) expanding the federal jurisdiction to include all federal prisons. A section-by-section analysis discusses the effects of each section. Discussions of inflationary impact and cost estimates are included. Finally, the changes this amendment makes in individual sections of Title 18, United States Code, are shown with existing law proposed to be omitted and new wording proposed to be included. (ABL)",

        "author":["Lauver, Philip J."],
        "description":"In order to develop competence in cross-cultural counseling, awareness of one's own culture must be developed. To survive, cultures incorporate both obvious mechanisms, like a distinctive language, and less obvious mechanisms, like patterns of thought. Culture acts as an invisible veil which prevents us from being aware of the cultural filters through which the world is viewed. Awareness of these less obvious filters, or barriers, is necessary before the effects of these barriers can be examined. The cultural predisposition is to call something that does not fit reality nonsense. By invoking nonsense, communication is closed and a barrier is created. A language barrier results from the function of language as representing experience. The tendency to overlook the powerful effects  of language on perception and behaviors is testimony that culture is working to protect its own from the awareness of other realities. A need exists to stereotype, to perceive things in groups rather than attend individual instances. Things are seen only as there are words to describe them, thus providing another barrier. Descriptions can be implicit evaluations. Assertions may be misvalidated by addressing the object rather than the author. Extending counseling cross-culturally begins internally in the mind and heart of the counselor. The counselor who is aware that understanding another can be incomplete at best has hope of becoming an effective counselor. (ABL)",

        "description":"The heterogeneity of alcoholic populations may be one reason that few specific therapeutic approaches to the treatment of alcoholism have been consistently demonstrated to improve treatment outome across studies. To individualize alcoholism treatment, dimensions which are linked to drinking or relapse and along which alcoholics display significant variability must be identified. One such dimension is the reinforcement expected from alcohol consumption. Alcohol reinforcement expectancies can be used in alcoholism interventions by attempting to modify reinforcement expectancies or by targeting individuals with certain expectancies and assisting them in developing alternative means of acquiring the designated type of reinforcement. This second approach was used in a pilot study  which identified 15 alcoholics in treatment who either scored high on the expectancy of Interpersonal Power/Aggression or low on this expectancy. Both groups were exposed to an adjunctive Assertion/Anger Management skills training program consisting of six 1-hour sessions. Preliminary results suggest that individuals who had high expectations for alcohol to enhance their interpersonal power and ability to express their anger benefited most from this training as measured by self-report, therapist ratings of improvement, and prognostic estimates. Follow-up data are currently being collected. (NB)",

In each passage, the influence of word relationships was assessed by manipulating the degree of semantic entailment between two words in a passage; the syntactic structure's influence was determined by manipulating the syntactic class in which the entailing word appeared. Subjects, 20 skilled and 20 less skilled high school readers, rated the degree to which a verb involved an associated case. Results demonstrated that the presence of entailing words significantly improved the ability of all readers to infer action-case relationships. However, reader skill interacted  with entailment to produce significant differences in passage comprehension. Skilled readers were (1) more efficient at analyzing the semantic relationships present in text, (2) better able to use other semantic information to make inferences when entailing words were absent, and (3) less dependent on explicit text-based factors for semantic analysis than were less skilled readers.

The children's concept maps provided excellent opportunities for further direct instruction, were developmental, and appeared to be a viable heuristic even for young learners. Teachers reported better test scores, improved understanding of conceptual relations and patterns, and more cooperative class discussions--especially in the peer group mapping events. Children's concept maps became increasingly detailed and complex across grade  levels. Second graders seemed to appreciate most fully the need for lists prior to mapping. Both second and third graders initiated concept mapping with the stories and nonfiction writing in which they were engaged, while fourth graders seemed less interested in the experiment though the maps seemed to help their general learning. Concept mapping better prepared the teachers to organize and present their subject matter and to see tangible improvement in children's learning and sharing of ideas in the classroom.

As an alternative to linear outlines, mind maps can provide for more effective comprehension as related ideas are conceptualized from the center out to supporting details, as well as from top to bottom or left to right. The mind map, an organizational skill that helps students to better understand a concept or an objective, can be used to introduce a total course, give a skeletal or course overview, or structure an entire lecture. Mind maps have four major advantages: (1) they aid professors or lecturers, (2) their open-ended quality allows students to brainstorm, (3) they help clarify student notes and liberate students to think , and (4) they increase  comprehension. Mind maps also set up a clear hierarchical and graphic structure that allows for easy recall of related ideas. The construction of maps is very open-ended, depending on determination of main objectives, lay-out of information, and personal creativity to aid review and recall. &quot;Mind maps,&quot;&quot;webs,&quot;&quot;semantic maps,&quot; etc., are new terms, and although they are not a panacea, they present an innovative and creative approach for organizing information and challenging the right side of the brain.

The results were interpreted both in terms of L. S. Vygotsky's scaffolding construct and as revealing a general maternal orientation to elicit the maximum performance of which the child is capable. Structural aspects of the interaction were relatively constant over the age range studied: for all three age groups, the mothers controlled the interactions, taking responsibility for  determining which of the pictures would be discussed. The content of the interactions varied as a function of the child's age; more active participation was demanded of older children, who were asked more questions by their mothers and who received more complex information. For all age groups, maternal questioning was related to the mother's beliefs about her child's word knowledge; she was more likely to ask the child to label a picture if she thought the child knew the label.

Retrospective interviews were conducted with the two primary case study writers, and their experiences were related to the revision patterns of 61 students in four classes. Statistics showed that students using computers to revise their compositions wrote longer papers and received slightly higher holistic scores. However, findings revealed  that the most striking differences had little to do with computers--class means corresponded dramatically with instructional emphasis. Results suggested that students revised according to a construct of &quot;good writing&quot; that could be linked to three instructional emphases: fluency, word choice, and mechanics. Results also indicated that revision of fluency, word choice, and mechanics could be taught. Thus, the results suggest that the revision process is driven by instructional emphasis, not computer interaction. (Interviews and scoring of the two primary case study writers and statistical tables are included.) (JD)",

        "description":"Focusing on purpose in the writing of college freshmen, a study examined the writing processes and how they related to the conceptions of purpose of four freshmen enrolled in a composition course at Indiana University. Discourse-based interviews were conducted before and after the students completed three tasks designed to vary their choice of audience, mode, and focus. Analysis revealed two tendencies that characterized how students viewed the purpose for their writing. Some students were &quot;rhetorically limited&quot; in the development of their purposes and proceeded according to a performance oriented, dualistic, mechanistic view of writing. Others were &quot;rhetorically flexible,&quot; constantly moving between their global and operational purposes. Results indicated that students' models of  writing and literacy probably influenced their writing more than the specific features of the tasks to which they were responding. At the highest level, these models either inhibited or enhanced the students' thinking processes by restricting or opening up possibilities for more specific purposes within and beyond the texts they were producing. Results support a writing pedagogy in which a qualitative reformulation of students' discourse models is more central to their continued learning than the quantitative acquisition or mastery of certain discourse-specific skills. (An analysis of one subject's response patterns and a three-page reference list are included.) (JD)",

        "description":"Focusing on the relationships between performance, skills, and attitudes, a study conducted at the University of Arizona measured the effects of reading and writing apprehension on basic writers. Results from three survey measures and expository paragraphs and essays written by 59 college freshmen enrolled in a basic writing course provided the data. The instruments used were these: (1) the Reading Apprehension Measure (based on Daly and Miller); (2) Vocabulary and Comprehension on the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Form D; and (3) the Miller-Daly Writing Apprehension Test. Results suggested that the course, designed to equip students with strategies for composing, helped students to gain the confidence necessary to increase writing skill. Results also indicated that students'  writing skills were enhanced when they understood the connection between reading and writing, and that simply requiring students to read carefully and critically could be a detriment to student confidence. The significant positive relationship between grades and reading performance measures suggested that a student's role as reader and writer cannot be separated easily. In addition, the positive correlation found between course grade and the placement essay score suggested that the placement essay probably provided more finely scaled information than expected. Finally, results suggested that the course's critical reading demands may have driven students' perceptions of apprehension to extremes. (Three pages of works cited and a table of data are included.)

Telephone interviews with 737 adults determined the perceived influence of mass media exposure on family, friends, and co-workers. These three social motivation types allowed the relationship between individual media patterns and the possible social motivations for those patterns to be examined. Findings showed that, although traditional individual level predictors were a significant influence, social  level predictors should be taken into account when an individual's knowledge levels are being considered. Group interactions provided a significant control for all other variables. Results also indicated that the relationship between social and individual motivations is substantially additive and that public affairs exposure interacts with social influences. In addition, while increased public affairs exposure showed no corresponding increase in knowledge, findings showed that the media were able to transfer substantial amounts of information at lower motivation levels. Motivation, then, was the overall best predictor of knowledge. (Supplementary tables and appendixes are included.) (JD)",

        "description":"A review of the literature on writing across the curriculum (WAC) programs indicates that most such programs have four components. First, the programs require that students complete one of the following before graduation: (1) a timed writing test, (2) a departmental endorsement system, (3) a quota of regular content courses designated &quot;writing intensive,&quot; or (4) a professional writing course. Second, WAC programs contain faculty development workshops, in which faculty from all departments cooperatively consider strategies for effectively incorporating writing into their courses. The literature in this area covers workshop structure, objectives and activities, audience, and general guidelines. Third, the programs include in-class seminars offered by the writing faculty to help the  remaining faculty integrate writing into content courses. Finally, programs include a writing center, in which trained peer tutors help students with their writing assignments. Research shows that if the administration and faculty are strongly committed to WAC programs, then such programs can be successfully implemented in a variety of colleges and universities. However, faculty development workshops must be followed up, preferably by a college obligation to help students write better. (A bibliography is included.) (JD)",

The 1985 membership directories for the Public Relations Society of America and the International Association of Business Communicators formed the sample frame and a questionnaire was mailed to 400 members, with a 34.8% response rate. Factor scales for environmental scanning indicated how frequently the practitioner engaged in each environmental scanning activity. An index for participation in management decision  making outlined the variables and the hypotheses tested. Findings showed that both scientific and informal scanning were positively and significantly correlated with the practitioner's managerial role activities, while neither type of scanning was correlated with the practitioner's technical role activities. Some correlation existed between the technical role scale and scientific scanning. Data showed the relationship between scientific and informal scanning and management decision making to be strong, even after the influence of managerial role playing by the practitioner was controlled.

To meet the needs of a new generation of technical communication leaders, a Master's program must include the study of writing, editing, publication, math, computer science, science and engineering literature, rhetorical principles, and genres of the workplace. Graduates in scientific and technological communication must be able to adapt to new technologies, learn methods of collaborative research, be adept at oral communication, know how to integrate print and visual media, and should know the costs and institutional impact of decisions made in communication applications. The faculty teaching such a program should be gathered from a variety of disciplines; facilities  should include computer, video, audio, print, and photographic laboratories; and the library should have multidisciplinary holdings purchased from one department's budget. Such a program must also be marketed in order to build it, though not with the purpose of defeating other programs. Good STC Master's programs should support students with assistantships and cooperative ties with industry to prepare students for work in industry, teaching, or further graduate work. (SRT)",

The computer also represents a new way of learning, emphasizing students' problem solving strategies and learning processes. Teachers must remain sensitive to the newness and complexity of the technical demands on the ESL student, which may compound fears about speaking and writing English. If initial word processing activities are brief, nonthreatening, and not heavily constrained by time, students are encouraged to explore the program's capabilities and to use the computer as part of their writing process, not as a glorified typewriter. Students learning word  processing must balance a multitude of interrelated, subtly coordinated, and self-motivated mental and physical activities requiring trial and error. Teachers must balance instructional concerns with the teaching of word processing until students have achieved a minimum level of competency. By using word processing, students become highly engaged in writing and learning language, gain new sensitivity to the flexibility of language, appear more receptive to feedback concerning the need for revision and editing, and improve their overall writing and language ability.

The first half of the booklet provides background information on sentence combining, exploring the basis for the claim that sentence combining enhances sentence writing by drawing on built-in linguistic competence, and arguing for a much broader definition of sentence combining. This section also discusses seven instructional issues concerning the use of sentence combining, and lists ten assumptions that seem to underlie the sentence combining approach. The second half of the booklet outlines many ways to use sentence combining in the writing class. This section first  deals with cued sentence combining, of the kind popularized by F. O'Hare, then shows how open exercises might be introduced and used in a middle school classroom. It also deals with such practical matters as orchestrating in-class projects, handling &quot;mistakes,&quot; and creating various types of sentence combining. The focus then shifts to a variation of pattern practice that may help special students, topics such as grammar, usage/mechanics, and sentence economy. Finally the section moves into arenas more explicitly rhetorical--style, recombining, and generative exercises, the problem of context, and analytic activities of different kinds. (HTH)",

        "description":"Though most definitions of literacy focus solely on the uses of reading and writing, a sociocognitive perspective that incorporates social practices, conceptions of reading and writing, and literacy as a way of thinking is more productive. Within this view, literacy is culturally based, involves the higher intellectual skills, and is learned by children as they interact with their families and communities. Schools can capitalize on the social nature of this view of literacy learning by creating instructional experiences in which students gain skills as they engage in broader and more purposeful literacy activities. Studies indicate that United States students are learning to read and write, but are not becoming literate thinkers. Rather than learning how to do something new and  thoughtful, such instruction emphasizes whether students have done something right. A sociocognitive view of literacy combines issues of society and schooling, asserting that (1) all learning is socially based, (2) literacy learning is an interactive process, and (3) cognitive behaviors are influenced by context and affect the meanings that learners produce. When considering the instructional implications of a particular interaction, it is important to determine who controls the interaction, what pedagogical functions are served by it, and what form each participant's contribution takes. A six-page list of references concludes the document. (JD)",

        "description":"Unless students have an appropriate attitude toward revision--the keystone of the writing process--teachers who institute writing process approaches face frustration and failure. Implementing the following suggestions may help increase revision in the classroom. First, while the mature writing process is not strictly linear, students developing writing ability need to focus on one aspect at a time in order to avoid cognitive overload and subsequent writer's block and apprehension. As children's writing abilities develop, the perceptive teacher can encourage greater interaction among the process stages. Second, the early steps of the writing process must focus on content and structure rather than on mechanics. Teachers should clearly differentiate between early revision steps and  the later step of editing. Third, a great deal of in-class time should be provided for revision, and this includes flexible due dates. Fourth, publication of student works with techniques such as dramatizing students' stories or sponsoring authors' days and writers' conferences will instill pride in their writing and reinforce the benefits of revision. Fifth, conferences between student and teacher best teach students how to use appropriate self-questioning of content and structure during revision. As students internalize initial enforcement, supportive feedback and direct instruction in the types of questions to ask they will become better able to revise their own compositions. (A general editing checklist, self assessment revision questions, and conference question types are included.)  (HTH)",

The first section of the booklet discusses conditions necessary for thinking--something to think about, something to think with, some ways  in which to think, and something to think for. The next section then presents a five step model for developing a thinking program using the existing K-12 curriculum, and discusses major implications of this model for teaching and learning.

        "description":"To determine students' metacognitive knowledge of the expository writing process, a study analyzed fifth and sixth graders' declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge by means of group questionnaires and individual interviews at all stages of their participation in one of three year-long writing programs. The programs emphasized social context, purpose and audience, and/or the use of text structure knowledge in writing. Results suggested that creating a social context enhanced students' awareness of audience, purpose, and the different aspects of the writing process. Instruction in text structure seemed to enhance students' understanding of both the questions answered by expository writers and the conventions used in expository writing, such as key words and phrases. The  combined program resulted in students' enhanced understanding of the extent to which these conventions can be used as signals to their readers of their writing's purpose. Findings showed that all the programs had a positive impact on students' knowledge about the writing process and writing strategies. Observations also revealed that students used this knowledge in other curricular areas. (Tables of data and some student commentary from individual interview sessions are included. (JD)",

Moving text on the screen is very easy, so it is possible to rearrange words or phrases and to discuss the differences these changes make in meaning or sentence flow. Computers are also helpful for demonstrating revision and group composing, with teachers going through the processes with students to help them understand the changes that can easily be manipulated on the screen. While writing research papers, students can prepare a preliminary question outline on the computer, save the outline on disk, and answer the  questions as they do their research. Or students and teachers can use a computer unit with both large screen and small screen monitors. The students can watch the large-screen monitor while the teacher types, watching the small screen.

Finally, in addition, writing centers could act as clearinghouses for previewing and reviewing new computer software, and could be used to train educators in the evaluation and selection of reading and writing computer software.

        "description":"Noting that the principles of writing process instruction typically offered to elementary teachers are less readily adaptable to intermediate classrooms emphasizing content area learning rather than basic skills, this paper explores two key themes important to the successful implementation of writing process instruction: (1) teachers' needs to understand clearly the philosophies and theories underlying writing process approaches, and (2) teachers' needs to assume the role of researcher in their classrooms to understand their students' writing needs and to determine how their strategies meet or fail to meet those needs. The paper first describes the concepts underlying the &quot;whole language approach&quot; and then examines some of the problems facing intermediate grade teachers as they  teach the writing process in their classes. These problems are: the need to broaden children's perspectives on different kinds of writing, the need to integrate writing with content area learning, and the need to become researchers in the classroom. To elaborate on the teacher as researcher, the paper outlines the developmental writing needs of intermediate grade students, and how writing can aid in identity building. Finally, the paper discusses the importance of a theoretical understanding of the underpinnings of whole language, as opposed to simple implementation of prescribed techniques. (HTH)",

Faculty from more than 15 two- and four-year institutions and many more high schools participate in this expansive collaborative project, which involves teacher inservice instruction and student writing evaluations. At Lorain County Community College, the program began with intensive sessions on holistic grading, followed by the assessment of the first control group of 1,500 and a second population of 3,000 in 1984. During the assessments, students write in response to a topic selected from several chosen collaboratively  by the program steering committee. Each essay is evaluated by one college faculty member and one high school English teacher who have attended an initial writing assessment workshop or viewed a videotape of the workshop. All essays are evaluated twice by each reader, first holistically and then analytically. They then note strengths and weaknesses on an assessment sheet, copies of which are kept by the college, returned to the school, and returned to the student. Schools also receive a computer printout providing a profile of writing competency levels and writing strengths and weaknesses in that school and in the county as a whole. Since 1983, more that 28,000 Ohio students have been assessed, and 300 teachers have been involved in the inservice and assessments. (HTH)",

The first phase of the study examined the college composition programs on the 19 California State University (CSU) campuses to identify and describe distinctive program features. The second and third phases measured both students' writing performance and self-perceptions of their writing achievement. Results confirmed the general hypothesis that the organization of composition instruction does matter: certain aspects of postsecondary writing programs are significantly associated with improved student performance and self-perceptions. The following conclusions emerged from an analysis of the relations among the holistic (HS), correctness and efficiency  (CE), and development and focus (DF) scores: (1) HS correlated highly with CE in the measurement of writing ability; (2) freshman composition students scored significantly lower in all three categories when only the upper-division certification method was used; (3) CE graded student writing samples more severely than DF; (4) students wrote better in programs that included both instruction and certification; and (5) when key administrators encouraged strong campus-wide writing instruction and assistance, students' writing performance increased.

(2) To what extent did the subjects' perceptions of request-effort and request-novelty collide and result in different compliance probabilities? and (3) How stable were subjects' impressions of the request sequences and to what degree were the subjects in agreement concerning request characteristics? Subjects, 84  intermediate-level speech communication students, were presented with a range of requests involving a number of different target behaviors. Results showed that subjects exhibited different compliance rates and perceptions about the novelty and/or effort associated with requests. However, the extent to which subjects' responses did not follow a pattern suggestive of a systematic convergence or divergence of perceptions associated with the requests could not be entirely accounted for by either dimension alone, or by a simple adaption level explanation. The study achieved a better understanding of which request sequences would be most natural in college situations. (Tables of data and a four-page reference list are included.) (JD)",

        "description":"Feminist thinkers offer new interpretations of the role of technology in social life. As society has progressed, men have become culture-centered rather than nature-centered, while women have remained nature-centered. Thus, women's devaluation resides in man's desire to control both nature and women. The values of objectivity, progress, rationality, production, and competition are masculine, while nurturance, emotionality, intuition, and cooperation are values traditionally assigned to women. Even so, women have been active creators and innovators throughout history, though most of the knowledge of women's roles as technological developers has been erased. Women will be affected most as new technologies invade the home, the office, and other workplaces. For example, as technology  revolutionizes life in third world countries, it has had both positive and negative effects on women's status and situation. Also, the spheres of men and women traditionally have been public and private, respectively, and urban design has only exacerbated women's lack of access to the public sphere, to mobility, to employment opportunities, and to public services. Unless women become involved in the decision making, new technologies will embody the same sexism, racism, and classicism they do now. Communication scholarship should attend to the contributions of women, especially in the field of technology. A four-page bibliography is provided. (SRT)",

Using a computer controlled videodisc, 60 communication students at a large midwestern university were shown the agenda-setting function of television and asked to evaluate the experience. Seventy-four high school faculty members from a school district that had served as a national demonstration center for computer-assisted learning were mailed a questionnaire. Accompanying it was a letter describing the individualized and group approach to instructional design. The teachers were asked to consider five dimensions concerning the application of the design philosophies in their own teaching. These dimensions were: (1)  integration into classroom style, (2) use of available classroom time, (3) benefit to students, (4) use of school's financial resources, and (5) preparation for students' lifelong learning. In general, students found the technology easy to use and the group process valuable in examining the components of a news story. In addition, they preferred to work with other people rather than alone with the machine. Faculty respondents perceived the group approach as more consistent, a better use of class time, and a more efficient use of financial resources when contrasted with individualized instruction. However, they also felt that the individualized approach to computer-assisted instruction would better prepare students for lifelong learning. The consensus position recognized that small group  and individualized approaches must be combined to optimize the educational process. (Tables of data and a reference list are included.) (JD)",

Subjects, 120 undergraduate speech students, completed the Receiver Apprehension Test (RAT) and the WBLT. Analysis of the data revealed a significant correlation between RAT scores and both long-term memory and total listening ability, though not between RAT scores and short-term memory. These significant relationships were curvilinear in nature, supporting the claims of validity for the Watson-Barker instrument. However, conclusions drawn from the study emphasize that more data must be accumulated before the WBLT can be considered &quot;externally valid.&quot; A five-page bibliography is  appended. (JD)",

The following five open systems propositions, based on a \"functional\" paradigm, address the complex relationship between public relations and organizational intelligence and do not call for studying the attributes of individual practitioners. First, public relations structure and process are functions of the host organization's sensitivity to its internal and external environment. This perspective can be analyzed using both functional and historicist models. Second, the effectiveness of public relations structure and process is a function of the adequacy of information input about the environment that gets factored  into organizational decision making. Third, the status of public relations in the organizational hierarchy is a function of the amount of variance in the organization's environment. Fourth, the level of public relations participation in organizational decision making is a function of the extent to which public relations engages in environmental intelligence activities. Fifth, an organization's ability to adapt to and influence its environment is a function of the nature and extent of public relations participation in management goal setting and program decision making.

        "description":"This document reports on a study to determine differential attitudes of experienced and inexperienced teachers toward supervision and evaluation. The basic hypothesis was that experienced teachers would have significantly different attitudes toward the concepts of supervision and evaluation than would inexperienced interns. A sample of 100 teachers, 50 in each group, was sent a survey instrument to determine their actual experiences with supervision and evaluation and their attitudes toward preferred practices. Little difference was found between the groups. Both groups favored items from the supervisory category over items in evaluation, although both groups recognized the importance of some of the characteristics of evaluation. A lack of uniformity in the data, however, made it  difficult to draw conclusions that were supported by the evidence. While the tendency of both groups to prefer supervisory activities over evaluative is interesting, the inability of experienced teachers to select ideal components of an evaluation program is troublesome. Teachers need to develop consensus on what makes a good supervisory program. The Supervision Attitude Inventory may need further scrutiny and editing before valid conclusions can be drawn. (IW)",

        "description":"Several models for improving school effectiveness are now available, and most of them highlight the principal's leadership role. Unfortunately, administrators do not regularly reflect on the important aspects of their professional roles or analyze the factors that may make it difficult for them to implement given models of effectiveness in their particular settings. This paper proposes a model for self-appraisal by principals. Principals should first review the research literature on competing models of school effectiveness. Second, principals should select the effectiveness model that best meets their needs, then match their own abilities with those required of administrators by the model. Finally, principals should interact with the effectiveness model to discover their own  strengths and weaknesses. Limitations on the self-appraisal model include (1) the difficulties in selecting criteria for judging effectiveness, (2) the confounding effects of experience and expertise, and (3) the implicit assumption that principals bring administrative knowledge to the process. An evaluation form to use in the self-appraisal process is included in the paper. Twenty-six references are cited. (PGD)",

        "description":"For a variety of reasons, including overemphasis on professional autonomy, many classroom teachers experience disillusionment and feelings of isolation. This paper explores teaching clinics as a way to break down barriers and foster dialogue among teachers. The Schenley High School Teacher Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, developed a teaching clinic where all district secondary teachers attend an eight-week professional redevelopment program. The clinic involves groups of six teachers who observe a teaching episode, collaboratively analyze observation data, and provide the focus teacher with feedback. The process is facilitated by two specially trained clinical resident teachers, a clinical coordinator, and four visiting teachers with effective teacher training. The program  emphasizes peer interaction and has elicited favorable responses from participants. The recipe for program success includes: (1) adequate preparation (immersing instructional and administrative staff in discussions and inservice sessions on relevant topics), (2) organizing the ingredients (instructional leadership, an adopted instructional model, training, interaction opportunities, and competent facilitators), (3) mixing thoroughly (promoting teacher interaction, involving administrators, stimulating opportunities for peer observation and feedback and other activities), and (4) simmering gently (sustaining a caring, nurturing ambience). Attached is an outline of the three phases of a teaching clinic and 18 references. (MLH)",

This paper reviews the basic leadership theories, asks questions about future leadership, and examines the learning experiences that produce effective leaders. The paper's intent is not to create a theory of multidisciplinarity, but to synthesize the leadership studies of other researchers and teachers. Six theories are summarized: (1) the trait theory, viewing leadership as a natural endowment; (2) situational theory, grounded in small group research; (3) organizational theory, focusing on specific skills within typically bureaucratic organizations; (4) power theories, encompassing skills such as persuasion and conflict resolution;  (5) holistic, visionary theory; and (6) ethical assessment approaches. A seventh view acknowledges all six theories and blends them within a broader context of existence and meaning. The paper next traces the evolution of leaders as specialists, and asserts the need for generalists for the new information environment. Various disciplines are briefly examined for their past contributions to leadership theory and their potential for developing a new leadership training curriculum for higher education.

        "description":"The insights of various theoretical perspectives on school improvement can be integrated in a common framework called \"the institutional perspective\" when the sensitivity of each theoretical perspective to the nature of decision making for school improvement is taken into account. The institutional perspective thus generated considers the organizational characteristics of the institution in which decisions are made; the organizational roles, perceptions, resources, and priorities of those making the decisions; and the need to adapt school improvement processes to accommodate the characteristics of the decision-making process. The main policy implication of the integrated institutional perspective is that to be successful, school improvement efforts must be educationally and  administratively robust. That is, the program must meet major educational needs simply and effectively and must be able to withstand competition from other organizational objectives and pressures in terms of their suitability to the administrative operations of the organization. This document examines the ways in which several theoretical perspectives are integrated into the institutional perspective, discusses the principle of educational and administrative robustness, and applies the principle to improvement efforts in the areas of curriculum change, organizational improvement, teacher improvement and evaluation, proceduralization, urban education, and school site autonomy.

These factors include time constraints, bureaucratic requirements, and reluctance to face emotional stress. Once a poor teacher is identified, efforts are rarely made to help the teacher improve. Unsatisfactory performance can be found in any of several aspects of a teacher's job, including subject area knowledge, ability to impart that knowledge, ability to maintain discipline, and others. The causes for poor performance can lie within the teacher, within the school, or in outside factors affecting the teacher. Remediation for teachers can take such forms as goal setting, instructional input, modeling, practice, counseling, environmental change, and  others. The reasons why such improvement efforts are rarely undertaken may include lack of time or funding, but may also have to do with the fact that as organizations, schools are conservative and tend to try to minimize risk rather than seeking to maximize gain. Teacher evaluators tend to prefer to identify incompetent teachers as competent rather than risk identifying competent teachers as incompetent. Evaluation systems should be revised to allow for more effective remediation. (PGD)",

        "description":"Most school administrations rely on one of two main forms of social control to ensure teacher conformity with organizational goals. The first, feedback and socialization, depends on teachers' attitudinal and behavioral conformity, commitment, and personal involvement in maintaining high standards. The second, programming and sanctions, depends on a system of punishments and rewards to ensure conformity. Data from 52 elementary schools in a large urban school system revealed that greater reliance on the feedback and socialization mode leads (1) to higher teacher conformity and (2) to a correspondingly high level of student achievement. Control by sanctions, conversely, has a negative effect on conformity and on achievement. Data also revealed that the negative relationships  between the sanctions mode of control and conformity are greatest in schools where the average amount of teacher training and experience is lowest. This study concludes that administrators can, therefore, affect student achievement by using feedback and socialization as a way of achieving organizational coordination and control.

The paper briefly describes district schools and circumstances affecting the school board's decision to implement mastery learning; discusses program assumptions; and reviews how curriculum tools ensure increasing congruence among curricular, instructional, student, and organizational outcomes. Curriculum is defined to include all consciously-written plans influencing student outcomes. Assumptions about the learner, teacher, purpose of schooling, and nature of knowledge are explicated. Mastery learning assumes that students become similar to one another in learning ability  under favorable conditions. Because most children master the curriculum, reform aspires toward a unified curriculum. Knowledge is transmitted in small increments. The structure of knowledge lends coherence (Piaget 1970); therefore, students apply learned generalizations to diverse contexts. The study presents a model developed at Red Bank with incremental instructional units and a &quot;generic&quot; cycle with corrective activities. As student achievement increases, revised unit objectives accommodate those entering grade levels with more of the skills necessary for mastery. Curriculum committees link budgets with improved student outcomes; personnel policies are reviewed for congruency with goals. Nineteen references are appended. (CJH)",

This part begins by describing  fragmentation and reform among Victoria's three major unions and goes on to interpret policy relations between unions and the Labor government between 1982 and 1985; Victorian unions reflect both democratic and oligarchic organizational tendencies. Union activity in policy formation, school organization, and the workplace, as well as in democratization of administrative and curricular decisionmaking are also described in this section.

        "description":"A model based on organizational theory was used in this study to discover educational goals emphasized by teachers in classrooms and to explore the impact of the social organization of schooling on these goals. Age-grade structure was examined as a possible organizational characteristic influencing moral and technical goals selected by teachers. Technical goals reflect such cognitive emphases as development of reading competency. Development of commitment to societal values is a moral goal. Seventy Chicago teachers in public and Catholic elementary schools were asked by questionnaire to indicate the degree of emphasis they place on learning a set of moral and technical goals in their classrooms. Basic skills, reading, and arithmethic represented technical goals; honesty,  cooperation, and citizenship were moral goals. Age-grade level, type of school (public and Catholic), and student composition were independent variables. Teacher emphasis on the six goals were dependent variables. Some evidence indicates that emphasis on basic skills and reading increases as a function of age-grade level, with an accompanying decrease in emphasis on honesty. Expected differences between type of school were not found. Further research is necessary for firm conclusions about how teachers actually select and implement goals. Twenty-one references are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"To overcome teacher isolation and help make teaching a more attractive profession, educators might consider a peer support system based on the Stanford Collegial Evaluation Program. This paper describes the program's background, functioning, barriers to successful implementation, and how to neutralize them. The Stanford program uses a peer evaluation process and emphasizes formative, not summative, evaluations. Linked in reciprocal relationships, teachers collect information on their performance from collegial observations, student questionnaires, and self-assessment. They analyze strengths and weaknesses and prepare a plan for improvement. The program's effectiveness lies in use of first-hand observations and stress on factors that teachers consider important. The program has  seven interdependent steps leading to an improvement plan. Major barriers to collegial evaluation such as teacher attitudes, lack of criteria validity and reliability, problems with administrator involvement, lack of teacher candor, and insufficient released time for observation may be overcome in a supportive school context by the right mixture of determination, good will, and humor. The key is wholehearted commitment to professional development. Included are 18 references and information on obtaining the implementation manual. (MLH)",

Rather than prescribing a single route to success, the guide offers examples of different evaluation experiences, describes possible evaluation courses, and, in separate chapters, offers five keys to effective evaluation: teachers, evaluators, performance data, feedback, and context. A subsequent chapter examines the important attributes of these keys in more detail. The guide concludes by offering two scenarios for success and a  discussion on evaluating existing evaluation procedures, improving the teacher evaluation environment, and upgrading evaluation skills. An appendix includes a teacher evaluation experience questionnaire and a questionnaire for evaluators' self-examination. (IW)",

        "description":"Although industrial and organizational psychologists have labored for two decades to understand processes governing behavior at work, the literature reveals little empirical work on organization value orientation and its effects on individuals within an organization. From research on personal values and interpersonal relationships, one might speculate that organizational values influence an individual's orientation and work behavior. This study sought to determine whether school systems' organizational value orientation affects teachers' organizational commitment and job satisfaction. The study examined the degree of normative and utilitarian orientation demonstrated by a random sample of 133 Kansas teachers completing three standardized questionnaires. Findings showed that  normative value-orientation was associated with diminished job satisfaction. While causes cannot be determined from the current data, the regression equation indicates that experience and organizational tenure are predictors of job satisfaction for both groups. Gender and experience may be the factors influencing organizational commitment. Findings suggest that school systems may need to develop personnel strategies and policies to assist teachers experiencing less job satisfaction. Administrators need to examine overall value orientation and its effect on teachers' attitudes. Included are 3 tables and 28 references. (MLH)",

Mintzberg's theoretical model of administrative behavior (1973) was applied to special education principals. Five structured observations were conducted with five special education principals; field notes were coded for analysis. Similar coding systems were used among the three levels of principalship to derive comparisons. Special education principals and other principals spend similar proportions of their time on the activities of pupil control and organizational maintenance. Differences among the three are as follows: (1) Special education principals work at a less hectic pace, engage in  fewer activities, and are minimally interrupted; (2) special education principals have a flexible work routine organized into blocks of time to attend meetings; and (3) special education principals spend more time completing deskwork, have longer meetings, and complete fewer supervisory activities than do regular principals. Special education principals were identified as figureheads and maintained a leadership position in daily operations. Nine tables of data and 23 references are included. (CJH)",

        "description":"To discover whether school districts can develop highly rationalized forms of instructional management, this study gathered data from a telephone survey conducted in the school year 1983-84 of administrators in 30 western districts. The instructional management practices of these districts were then compared with an &quot;ideal type&quot; of rationalized instructional management system. Informants considered knowledgeable about districts' practices nominated districts engaged in &quot;exemplary&quot; practices and recommended other potential informants. Of the 39 districts in 3 states contacted, 2 or 3 administrators were interviewed for 1 hour each. Interviews centered around exemplary instructional management practices; respondents described the practice, discussed its relation to other practices,  and reviewed implementation. Data analyses focused on practices in curriculum development, instructional assessment, and staff supervision and evaluation. Data analysis interpreted how a practice was coordinated with other practices. A rationalized model includes routinized instructional technology, a mechanistic control system, and a cult of efficiency. The study's conclusion is a qualified yes to the original research question. The qualifying factors are as follows: (1) due to resource constraints, rationalization of instructional management practices probably occurs in a fragmented way; (2) such fragmented change can evolve into an integrated system only after 15 to 20 years of practice; (3) implementation of rationalized reforms involves more than structural change. School culture  must change from a logic of confidence toward a cult of efficiency to reduce teacher and administrator resistance. (CJH)",

Principals interviewed in urban settings expressed concern about student gangs and safety. In rural schools, administrators stated that community cohesion and geographical isolation reduce certain behavior problems. In suburban settings, a major concern is stress management for students. Such differences in disciplinary concerns demonstrate that varying contexts require diverse approaches. Interviewers were frequently told that a program with a clear rationale based unequivocally on fairness seemed the most effective; that involvement of staff, students, and parents in structuring discipline  procedures is an integral portion of effective management programs; and that access of parents to the school and cooperative dialogue is essential. Although administrators expressed variation in personal style, themes common among each setting were discovered. Rural schools facilitate management through community and familial ties. Urban and suburban schools work harder to build these links to facilitate the entire disciplinary process. Administrators consistently spoke of their desire to motivate students toward self-discipline; however, institutional responses must be fashioned within a system of fairness that allows students to take responsibility for their actions. A literature sample and names of contact organizations are provided. (CJH)",

Ernest Brown reviews reasons for the growing sentiment against tenure and advises legislators to consider the consequences if it is abolished. Nelda Cambron-McCabe advises school officials to be familiar with due process principles and to apply them in rendering  adverse employment decisions. Christaine Citron concludes that if the legal issues discussed in her essay are considered in the policy-making process, reform that aims to improve teacher quality will not be impeded. James Gross and Thomas Knight report on the tenure decision process in New York State. Explanations and examples of \"good cause\" for teacher dismissal are offered by David Larson. Bruce MacDonald outlines the important actions that school boards must take prior to and during a hearing on a teacher's incompetency.

Among twelve recommendations for state education agency (SEA) leadership are the following: Chief state school officers should take the lead in identifying as a major state priority the need for adequate transition services for disabled students who have completed secondary school. SEAs should consider establishing a full-time coordinator position  or designating a unit to work with local school systems to plan and implement transition programs. SEAs should encourage coordination and analysis of state data bases required for special education, vocational education, and vocational rehabilitation management. SEAs should promote cooperation between education agencies and the private sector so that vocational education programs are responsive to labor market trends and employer skill demands. (JW)",

An initial explanation of terms (such as &quot;least restrictive environment&quot; and &quot;related services'&quot; is followed by an overview of the process, including parental responsibilities. Subsequent sections address issues related to assessment, evaluation, placement, and the individualized education program (IEP). Definitions of handicapping conditions are provided. A discussion of parent participation in the IEP planning meeting includes three checklists for parents to use. A section on vocational education  describes Public Law 94-482 (the Vocational Education Act Amendments of 1976) and discusses the relationship of the IEP to vocational goals. Information on vocational education assessment and on the nature and importance of the vocational IEP meeting is also provided. A final section discusses the due process hearing, including parental rights, school responsibilities, and the formal procedures involved. (JW)",

The project employed a variety of communication mechanisms and formats (newsletters, electronic mail, conferences, research abstracts, issue briefs) to disseminate special education research to more than 3,000 education policymakers and administrators on four identified topics: special education technology, special  education finance, related services, and special education program effectiveness. Among conclusions drawn from project evaluation data are that policymakers use research indirectly (rather than directly) to shape policy debates; that custom-tailored communication is a key to effective dissemination; and that dissemination strategies are most successful when selected according to suitability for a specific task, at a specific stage in the policy decision-making process.

        "description":"Over the past ten years, dramatic changes have been seen in the numbers of mildly mentally retarded students in the United States; in particular, a 30 percent decrease in the number of mildly mentally retarded students between 1976 and 1986 has been well documented. These changes have occurred in response to litigation in the federal courts, concerns about the fundamental nature of mental retardation (particularly whether persons from \"adverse\" socioeconomic circumstances can be classified as mildly mentally retarded), and disputes about the nature and meaning of adaptive behavior. Two issues are critical in the changing status and diagnosis and treatment of the mildly mentally retarded. The first is the fundamental meaning of the diagnostic construct of mild mental retardation,  and the second is the outcome of special education programs for students classified as mildly mentally retarded. This issue of outcomes may be addressed more effectively in current special education reforms, through use of evidence from follow-up studies to design curricula, and in basic research on cognitive modifiability. These trends may lead to the development of more effective programs in the future which make genuine differences in the capabilities of persons who used to be, and in some cases still are, classified as mildly mentally retarded.

        "description":"Shakespeare's plays are the apex of western achievement in the humanities and as such afford a highly fertile mechanism for teaching gifted elementary and secondary students. Studying Shakespeare facilitates the understanding of an earlier form of the English language and illustrates the evolutionary nature of language. Aside from a sense of historical continuity, reading and viewing Shakespeare can help students to develop a love of both the sound and sense of language. Analytical and imaginative thinking can be stimulated by the figurative speech in Shakespeare's plays, which are primarily written in verse, and poetry by virtue of its compression of language is highly challenging. Reading the plays promotes knowledge of and discussion about history, psychology, anthropology,  sociology, government, and ethics. In teaching Shakespeare, teachers should familiarize students with the story, or plot, of the play; if they are reading the play, they should also have a scene-by-scene synopsis to make it easier to follow the play. The play can be discussed as both a literary work and a dramatic production. Students should be encouraged to visualize the play's events and the characters' actions and reactions. Students could act out the entire play, or focus on passages (such as soliloquies) which can be analyzed critically. (CB)",

        "description":"The use of systematic prompting and monitoring to increase written sentence production during a ten-minute assigned composition task was investigated with 78 learning disabled (LD) students in grades 7-12. Subjects were classified as LD, were receiving special education services, and evidenced at least a 2-year lag in written language skills. Six experimental groups each consisted of 13 students randomly assigned to one of two prompting conditions: Systematic Prompt Reduction (SPR) or Random Prompt Administration (RPA). The SPR condition included four levels of prompts administered in order from most independent to most dependent: self-initiating, motivational, content-related, and literal. Students were also randomly assigned to one of three monitoring and recording conditions:  No Monitoring (NM), Prompt Monitoring (PM), and Prompt and Production Monitoring (PPM). Analyses of variance revealed no statistically significant differences in either production or quality of final compositions among the six groups. It is suggested that future investigations of systematic prompt reduction techniques include monitoring of prompts and production in the context of a cognitive behavior modification strategy with a more selective group of LD students. Appendices provide the sentence production topics, the Sequential Prompt Reduction prompts, the Systematic Prompt Reduction manual, and a composition rating scale. Twenty-four references are also provided. (Author/JW)",

The sample consisted of 9 parents who had requested institutional placement, 28 parents who had requested group home placement, and 23 parents who had not requested out-of-home placement. A questionnaire obtained demographic data as well as attitudes about normalization through a 20-item, 5-point Likert scale which measured the degree to which each respondent agreed with principles and practices of normalization in the context of his or her own child. Data did not document a relationship between type of residential placement preferred and attitude about normalization. In general, mothers answered the questionnaires. Parents generally  agreed on 11 items which were more philosophical in nature (e.g., mentally retarded children should have opportunities to pursue desires, need warmth and affection as much as anyone else, have the same basic rights and needs as anyone else, and should dress like other nonhandicapped children their age). Parents typically disagreed on 6 items, especially those involving mainstreaming their mentally retarded child in the public school. Nine questionnaire items elicited relatively neutral responses. In general, results indicated that parents agreed with the conceptual/philosophical aspects of normalization but not with the means by which this principle is implemented. It is concluded that if professionals expect parents to engage their mentally retarded children in normalization activities,  they need to support parents in carrying out this responsibility by involving them in the planning and programming of services.

The second section, written by Lester J.

Section Three, written by Edith E. Beatty and titled &quot;Qualitative Responsive Approaches to Evaluating Special Education Program Quality,&quot; addresses the local context; qualitative responsive evaluation; frameworks; and implementing qualitative responsive evaluations. The fourth section, written by Kenneth R. Olsen, is a comparative analysis of the approaches presented by Horvath and Beatty and discusses areas of agreement between the two approaches (stakeholder involvement, criteria for effective evaluations, emphasis on quality) and areas in which the methods differ (issues and concerns versus decisions, knowing design in advance, need for consensus).  The final section outlines administrative implications of the findings and lists questions to help special education administrators in choosing the appropriate method for evaluating the quality of their special education program.

The first chapter discusses underlying philosophy and principles (normalization, independent living, self-determination, the role of education in the transition process, and the role of work in adult living). Issues for analysis in the process of transition are discussed in Chapter 2 and include definitions and degrees of handicap, options on leaving regular or special schools, alternatives to competitive employment, youth traineeships, promotion of more flexible working arrangements, parent and community involvement, and personnel preparation. Chapter 3 looks at transitional program strategies at the school level, at the tertiary level of training,  and at the level of community living and vocational placement. Over half the monograph contains brief program descriptions of innovative transition programs in Australia, some established by government agencies but most arising from community efforts. A final section provides commentaries of three Americans: G. T. Bellamy, D. Brolin, and M. Peterson. (DB)",

First, a brief description of Swedish welfare policy as it applies to the population as a whole is presented. Next, services available to people with disabilities are described with emphasis on personal assistance programs which help to keep disabled and elderly citizens out of institutions. These services are then evaluated based on available statistical material, contacts with providers and consumers of the services, and the disabled author's own experiences. These services include personal assistants, the county home health service, escort services, evening patrols, emergency call systems, and cluster housing. Assessment is  in terms of administrative compartmentalization, economic and other obstacles to deinstitutionalization, professionalism and limited consumer input, decentralized financial responsibility and regional inequality, and limited consumer choices. Noted is the formation of the Stockholm Independent Living Group of disabled consumers concerned with increasing choices in personal assistance alternatives. Research issues in the areas of needs assessment, redefining institutions, degree of consumer control, quality criteria, and program design are identified. An appendix contains design criteria for personal assistance programs. Finally, four commentaries by American rehabilitation experts are added. (DB)",

Chapter 2 details organizational and scientific aspects of wheelchair testing and evaluation in the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia. Chapter sections consider test methodologies and procedures, the process of using a wheelchair, location of use, propulsion, sitting posture,  carryability, wheelchair type, a rolling-road for powered wheelchairs, government supply policy, and evaluation reports. The third chapter gives an overview of initiatives in Europe in the field of computerized information services concerning disability. After a brief description of The Nordic Register (Scandinavia), Bardsoft and BARD (Great Britain), and activities in the development stage in France and elsewhere, the chapter focuses on the Italian system (SIVA) which requires no previous computer knowledge to use, contains information on technical aids for the disabled, allows multilingual access, and is integrated into other Italian services.

Results show the intimate relationship between classroom language use and all other factors influencing a child's daily existence. Use of functional and formal language was marked by both general similarity and  appropriate variation in context, and suggests that in a classroom where a variety of language functions are encouraged, children's formal language knowledge is stimulated. Findings on language alternation suggest that the skill is a useful resource in conversations, that children use one language more than another for requesting and allocating during each activity, and that the children usually use a language appropriate to their speech partner's language dominance.

Teacher-student interaction and the variation in teacher and student language use were observed and recorded. These data were coded using a modified system of conversational-acts (C-acts). The language was analyzed according to the utterances' grammatical structure, illocutionary properties, general semantic or propositional content, and for frequency and proportional usage. Results showed great consistency in the bilingual teacher's language use across groups, while the monolingual teacher's patterns of C-act use  across language proficiency groups were quite different. Instructional organization and the use of the students' native language also varied between teachers relating to the different groups. The findings show that a monolingual teacher cannot act as effectively as the bilingual, for the monolingual is not familiar with language patterns that may cause confusion for second language learners.

The speech produced by three limited English-speaking children in an English program suggests that formulaic speech enables learners of English as a second language (ESL) to perform a number of important communicative functions in the classroom. These functions contribute directly or indirectly to the learner's acquisition of rules for producing novel sentences. It is concluded that in the early stages of second language development, formulaic speech may be more significant than creative rules, and that in planning ESL programs for beginners, teachers should  think about which formulas will be of most use to the students and watch for opportunities to naturally introduce and practice them.

Listener responses to the stories indicate that storytelling conventions are not shared or understood by all listeners. It is proposed that membership in different speech communities based on factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and family affects the textbuilding conventions speakers have available to them. It is further proposed that such cultural embedding can confuse the foreign students who, when faced with a second language interaction, can easily neglect the very ethnographic information they might be sensitive to in their own language. Activities encouraging foreign students to explore a wide range of possible interpretations for a given interaction can  help students focus on problem-solving strategies rather than on simple interpretations, solutions, or cultural stereotypes.

The preservation of the ancestral Lakota dialect of the Siouan language is discussed in terms of the implications for educational program planning. It is concluded that many existing programs classified as bilingual are really transition programs providing only a brief daily exposure to the native language. In addition, the English spoken on the reservations is frequently a nonstandard variety that has been analyzed and validated as an old and continuing dialectal form. It is suggested that in light of this information, instruction in Standard English as a Second Dialect combined with native history  and culture courses might become the program of first choice for many schools.

The responses were scored using both exact-answer and acceptable-word methods. The results indicate that the effectiveness, measured as reliability and validity, appears to be strongly related to how well a given cloze passage fits a given student sample. This suggests, in turn, that pretesting any cloze passage is necessary so that an appropriate passage can be selected and modified or tailored to fit a certain group of students. Taking some or all of these steps should help produce a more reliable and valid norm-referenced instrument on  whose scores responsible decisions about students can be based. (MSE)",

Formal rules provide self-evaluation for purposes of self-correction, a process which allows learners to judge or self-correct their own utterances against rule-generated predictions in order to get intimately familiar with the sound patterns of oral English. While teachers are not directly involved in this process, it may be one of the greatest contributions teachers can make to students' language acquisition success, for students will know how to teach themselves, in and out of class, with learned phonological rules.

These include the degree to which they can provide students with knowledge about the writing topic; their information about the expectations of the audiences for whom the students will write; their ability to involve students in the writing process sufficiently to enable them to consciously select methods to suit their writing intentions; and the degree to which they can encourage students to value self-evaluation. However, these limitations should not discourage the teaching of composition; rather they should help clarify what teachers  can do in composition class, such as encouraging students to observe their environment carefully, illustrating techniques to create a particular effect, helping students to examine and enjoy the work of other writers, and urging them to be the final judges of the success of their work.

These include the possible contribution teachers are making to the demise of certain languages or linguistic communities, the promotion of a language widely used for purposes of political, economic, and social power, especially in countries in which the teacher is not a native, and the responsibilities of training English teachers who could use the language to promote culturally and  politically dangerous ideology.

Exercises that demonstrate this purpose of relative clauses, or other grammatical constructions, can provide useful practice for students. More generally, an approach to teaching grammar that asks what purpose a structure serves can enable teachers to design exercises that demonstrate function as well as form. Exercises for relative clauses might include the presentation of situations in which the student must choose between two options and respond by using a relative clause with &quot;that,&quot;&quot;whose,&quot;&quot;where,&quot; or &quot;who,&quot; or by repeating a single form in different situations. The significant difference between these exercises and pattern drills is in the de-emphasis of form and the emphasis on the function of  the structure.

        "description":"A functional theory of semantics that accounts for idioms, rigid expressions, and language variability and indeterminacy is explored. The theory is based on the distinction between language as a natural, social phenomenon and linguistic systems as the constructions of linguists, and avoids the usual tendency of theory to assume that language is a logical system. It allows for explanation of variability as the creation of linguistic forms within given contexts, without attempting to pin it down to a specific rule, and distinguishes between structural and functional indeterminacy. Idioms, metaphors, the use of prepositions with unforseeable illocutions, fantasy, science fiction, and interpretable and uninterpretable nonsense are treated as the result of a form of indeterminacy, or  creativity--an unpredictable condition within conventional linguistic theory.

The analysis is done in the context of elementary propositional logic. The first section is a limited discussion of the standard logician's treatment relegating \"hence\" to the realm of non-truth-functionality: that is, the truth-value of the compound proposition is not simply a function of the truth-values of its components. The second section advocates treating \"hence\" as a propositional logical connective and outlines the argument, based on natural language-oriented semantics. The third section offers a partial explanation of why standard propositional logic has been accepted by generations of logicians and  non-logicians despite the vagueness concerning its relation to natural language and reasoning. The lack of interest in and respect for the multi-faceted linguistic role of the word \"hence\" is unwarranted. (MSE)",

First, the text receives much coherence from its description of a single event, a situation where happenings are normal and expected. Second, a rather primitive and simple discourse universe is gradually expanded into a more elaborate one by introducing new individuals related to the original ones, by building on existing referents, and by combining sentences to illustrate the social relations between individuals and the attitude of these individuals toward school. This technique enables the reader to draw inferences about the story. The factual cohesion considered here is distinct from other  elements such as cohesion markers, which are not markers but only symptoms of factual, situational, and iconic cohesion. (MSE)",

While there are the risks that non-native students will become embarrassed and withdrawn, or will develop negative feelings about American society, there are ways to minimize those risks. This can be done by considering the characteristics of the class and the amount of trust between students and teacher, easing into the topic, and maintaining an objective tone. Students benefit from controversial topics by developing confidence in discussing them in an atmosphere of trust and minimal personal risk-taking. The approach used in one university-level ESL course was to provide a preparatory lesson in anticipation of a visiting lecturer on the issue of child abuse, with  three objectives: to learn what students already knew about the topic, to encourage them to think about related issues, and to have them come up with their own questions on the topic. The next class period was devoted to small group discussions based on topics presented in the previous day's lecture. The discussions, based on factual material and questions on the lecture topic, were related to American culture. (MSE)",

The instrument's development includes a continuing process for drafting, selecting, and polishing essay topics, a pretest, determination of the procedures for reading and scoring essays (including reader selection and training, and scoring reliability), solving technological problems associated with changing the overall test format, incorporating TWE scores into the TOEFL scale, and giving the test a name.

The communicative classes used only authentic materials, thematically organized and prepared for classroom use by the instructors. Similar topics were addressed in each language. Testing of all language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) involved functional language use situations. Comparison of the test results of the experimental and control groups showed no significant differences between them, but an attitude survey of both groups revealed that students responded favorably to the absence of a traditional text. However, while some students thrived on the responsibility offered by  the communicative approach, and the experimental group seemed generally well-motivated, some missed the traditional vocabulary lists for each topic, the review of grammatical structure, and the disciplined structure of finite content and testing. The program's teachers found that selection and planning for using the authentic materials required considerable extra preparation time, and that they needed to minimize their role of authority to encourage the students' direct contact with the culture. Students seemed to favor current events materials and gained respect for the new points of view they encountered. (MSE)",

New technologies cause economic and ethical problems but also provide immediate access to information. Fiscal problems for higher education in many countries have meant that budgets for dissemination and storage of knowledge, especially library funds and allocations for university presses, have been cut. University presses, particularly in the United States and Britain, are major publishers of scientific literature. Scholarly journals are typically  edited in universities and frequently published on campus. Academic institutions are also the primary users of scholarly publications. Universities, through the system of evaluation of professional performance, act as indirect gatekeepers, deciding what kinds of knowledge will be rewarded. Universities in the large industrial nations are the major producers of scholarly knowledge, as well as the main distributors. Academic institutions in other countries, and particularly in the Third World, are, in the main, consumers of scholarly materials and research published elsewhere. (SW)",

        "description":"Results of a study of trends in college-going decisions of new high school graduates between 1972 and 1980 are presented, along with a model of college choice. The focus is the choice between college and noncollege options. Based on a review of empirical and theoretical work on college choice over the past 25 years, information is provided on key variable categories for each major study, along with the dependent variables and data sources employed. Based on studies of traditional students, 13 critical variables and 10 noncritical variables that may influence college choice are examined. Variables for a college choice model for nontraditional students are also identified. Changes in high school graduates' college choices between 1972 and 1980 are assessed, based on results of the  National Longitudinal Study (NLS) of the high school class of 1972 and the High School and Beyond (HSB) surveys. Work that was required to prepare comparable NLS and HSB data is also described (i.e., coding, recording, and missing-data procedures). Conferences were held at Harvard University to assess and extend the review of college choice studies and to evaluate the match between data and sample requirements and the national and longitudinal studies. Conference participants are listed. (SW)",

Recommendations include: increasing maximum awards for Pell grants; providing nontraditional students access first to grants and then to loans; targeting Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants to students with exceptional financial need; expanding State Student Incentive Grants to provide special aid to adult  learners over age 25; expanding the repayment period on student loans; and acknowledging the importance of child care in student grant and loan programs. H.R. 2111, a bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965, would increase accessibility for lower-income, nontraditional students by expanding the amount of affordable child care available to low-income college students. The bill would also provide stipends to students studying child care by arranging part-time employment in child care programs. The text of this bill is included. (SW)",

One proposal recommends restructuring the Pell Grant Program to target its support on low-income students and to make it more sensitive to the costs of different types of colleges. Recommendations include: implementing a single needs analysis system for federal student aid programs; adopting a master calendar for the delivery of federal student aid to insure adequate notification and timely delivery of aid; limiting the number of years that a student may receive a grant to assure students are making satisfactory progress toward completing their studies, and redefining what constitutes independent students so that independent students who have dependents are  treated fairly. It is noted that an increasing number of college students from farm families are found ineligible for Pell Grants because the needs analysis system does not acknowledge that unearned income is already obligated to retiring debt or meeting tax liability. To address this problem, H.R. 2481 would amend the Higher Education Act to provide fair treatment in computing family contributions in college student aid for students affected by the sale or forfeiture of family farm assets.

It is proposed that secondary and postsecondary schools be helped to provide improved information and counseling services to students (and graduates) to facilitate their college and employment decision-making. To increase awareness of the availability of student assistance, a national center for postsecondary opportunity is proposed. Additional suggestions include: increased TRIO services and funding that reach the Hispanic community; and focusing TRIO services more directly to meet the unique educational  needs of Hispanics. Also considered are the High School Equivalency Program and the College Assistance Migrant Program (HEP/CAMP). CAMP involves tutoring, facilitators, and guidance counselors familiar with the backgrounds and problems of migrant/seasonal farmworkers. Attention is directed to the following issues: the need for multiyear funding for HEP and CAMP; consideration of past performance as a selection criterion for HEP and CAMP funding; and the need for increased appropriations for HEP and CAMP programs.

        "description":"Hearings on reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965 focus on Title III or institutional aid. Title III is the largest nonstudent assistance program and was established to strengthen the academic quality of developing colleges by financing special projects and programs at individual colleges and by increasing the use of consortia and cooperative arrangements. Although black colleges have been the primary beneficiaries of Title III, many small colleges have also benefited. Program goals were to improve an institution's academic quality, management, or fiscal stability. A bill to revise and modify Title III, H.R. 2907, seeks to eliminate confusion about institutional eligibility and provide direct assistance to minority institutions and traditional colleges and  universities serving large numbers of low-income minority students. The bill also introduces two new concepts to the Higher Education Act that establish set-asides for historically black colleges and universities and for national-origin-based higher education institutions (i.e., Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific-Basin institutions). The bill would preserve the 30 percent set-aside of funds for junior and community colleges and would authorize the first 5 years of a 10-year program of aid to historically black institutions.

Training methods and programs and special policy considerations for higher education are also covered. Of major concern is sexual harassment by supervisors and by coworkers in the workplace or by faculty members of students and by students of other students on campus. The institution remains responsible for establishing an harassment-free environment. In developing a policy to prevent sexual harassment, important issues are the degree of specificity of definitions and situations and the question of consenting sexual relationships between student and faculty and/or  employee and supervisor. Appendices include: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex; a list of sexual harassment court cases; sample policies on sexual harassment from higher education, business, industry, and the federal government; a complaint or grievance form; a sexual harassment investigation checklist for managers; a model questionnaire on sexual harassment; actions recommended for alleged victims of sexual harassment; descriptive information on 15 films; and an updated 5-page bibliography of resources and articles on sexual harassment.",

Included is a state-by-state analysis of the status of workplace privacy. Definitions are offered of \"invasion of privacy,\" with attention to four types of privacy invasions: (1) placing someone in a \"false light,\" (2) the public disclosure of embarrassing private facts, (3) intrusion into someone's solitude, and (4) misappropriation of someone's right to publicity, to the pecuniary advantage of the defendant. Avoiding invasion-of-privacy and defamation claims requires a coordinated program of information management covering all phases of the employment relationship. For the following employment issues, legal protections are examined, along with actions that can  be taken to implement and maintain a management information policy: preemployment screening procedures, employee records, use of polygraphs, drug testing, employee searches and surveillance, regulation of nonworking time, and employment references. The state guide to right-to-privacy includes citations of relevant statutes and case law, along with narrative explanation. (SW)",

Major impacts include: increased ethnic consciousness of Asian American students, increased sensitivity of colleges to Asian American curriculum and student services needs, positive support for Asian American community organizations, and research dealing with Asian Americans. Four concerns that are future priorities are as follows: (1) the need to redesign courses/curricula to better accommodate the needs, interests, and backgrounds of immigrant generation Chinese, Pilipino, Korean, Indochinese, and Asian Indian students; (2) the need to create a strong organizational network of AAS  programs to exchange ideas on management, curriculum development, research, and responses to college financial cutbacks; (3) the need to develop new theoretical concepts and to explore new research topics, including the characteristics, communities, and problems of recent Asian immigrants; and (4) the need for AAS programs to closely reexamine their relations with Asian American communities. Seven additional priorities that might be addressed by AAS programs in the future are identified. The scope of a 1985 research project on AAS programs is briefly described.

Participants--26 operationally qualified C-141 pilots with no prior knowledge of the Fuel Saving Advisory System (FSAS), a computerized fuel management system for C-141 and C-5A aircraft--were randomly assigned either to an experimental group to receive training on the FSAS via the microcomputer-based, self-tutorial trainer or to a control group to be trained by an instructor on the flight deck of an FSAS-equipped C-141 aircraft. Both groups were trained to criterion proficiency on eight basic FSAS tasks, and time required to achieve proficiency was measured for all subjects on all tasks.  As a result of training, the experimental group achieved a mean proficiency rating across the eight tasks which was significantly superior to that of the control group. Moreover, a transfer effectiveness ratio applied to assess transfer of training from the experimental trainer to the criterion task in the aircraft indicated the experimental trainer was fully as effective as aircraft training for the tasks and yielded a cost benefit ratio of 4.76 to 1 (aircraft training cost versus microcomputer trainer cost), which demonstrates the potential benefit of the experimental trainer to reduce training cost. Additional data are presented in two tables, and references are provided. The trainer tryout questionnaire and cost data documentation are appended. (Author/KM)",

An outline of model types and an overview of the learning environment based upon progression of qualitative, causal models are presented; issues related to the design of zero-order, qualitative models for circuit behavior are discussed; different types of possible evolutions of a student's mental model are enumerated; and one path through  the space of possible model evolutions, a curriculum for helping students learn troubleshooting, is presented. The learning strategies that such a tutoring system architecture facilitates are then described and some instructional trials of the system are briefly discussed. Finally, an outline of a set of alternative mental models that a student should acquire in order to more deeply understand how circuits work is presented, and the extensibility of this approach to the creation of intelligent learning environments for other subject domains is considered.

        "description":"Soar, an architecture for problem solving and learning based on heuristic search and chunking, has been applied to a variety of tasks during the development of the Soar project, the goal of which is to build a system capable of general intelligent behavior. The hypothesis being tested in this aspect of Soar research is that chunking, a simple experience-based learning mechanism, can form the basis for a general learning mechanism. Previous work has demonstrated how the combination of chunking and Soar could acquire search-control knowledge (strategy acquisition) and operator implementation rules in both search-based puzzle tasks and knowledge-based expert systems tasks. This paper provides a new demonstration of the capabilities of chunking in the context of the macro-operator  technique and shows how: (1) this technique can be used in a general, learning problem solver without the addition of new mechanisms; (2) the learning can be incremental during problem solving rather than requiring a preprocessing phase; (3) the macros can be used for any goal stated in the problem; and (4) additional generality can be obtained via transfer of learning between macro-operators if an appropriate representation of the task is available.

Results indicated that the group with continuous exposure to computers showed greater reduction of anxiety scores and higher than predicted  scores on a standard measure of computer literacy. The second study measured 127 undergraduates who had little or no previous computer science coursework, all of whom were enrolled in a fundamental computing course (47% males and 53% females). The only measure administered to this group was the Computer Anxiety Index (CAIN).

To appropriately measure those skills, a Piagetian-based paper and pencil test of cognitive development called &quot;How Is Your Logic?&quot; (HIYL) was administered to a total of 116 undergraduates in three beginning computer programming courses at a small liberal arts college. In the first study of 87 students, 91% who received a course grade of &quot;B+&quot; or higher were formal thinkers, while no one who was classified as concrete operational received a grade higher than a &quot;C+.&quot; The correlation  between course grades and HIYL was statistically significant. In study two, the performance of 29 students on a pre- and posttest of HIYL was compared with their performance in the course to measure cognitive development during the course; scores on the two forms did not demonstrate measurable development over the 10 weeks of the course. Using a Piagetian framework to analyze the text used by all classes, three major components requiring formal thought were identified--hierarchical classifications of abstract concepts, control structures, and top-down design--and each is discussed. The criteria for classification, weighting components, correlations between HIYL and grades, and correlations between course and test grades are displayed in tabular format. (DJR)",

Previously, the third stage has not been well elaborated, a statement supported by an analysis of the content and context of European media. A critical appraisal of the present state of the art reveals the lack of a fundamental and theory-based approach in past investigations, which underscores the need for an integration of media studies in current cognitive research on learning and instruction. Work at the University of Leuven serves as an illustration of the growing tendency to design and study educationally relevant and theory-based learning environments that fit into the school curriculum, and in  which detailed data are collected on students' learning and problem solving.

Conference discussion centered around the themes of subject search enhancements for the next generation of online catalogs, the future role of class number searching in online catalogs, and the feasibility of using machine-readable LCC and DDC schedules online. Six broad conclusions for the future are outlined: (1) all operational online catalogs should include the subject search features that have already proven necessary; (2) subject search strategies  should be explored; (3) it is worthwhile to build the DDC into a classification authority file, available in machine-readable form for use as a cataloger's tool and in online catalogs; (4) using the Dewey Online Catalog (DOC) as a prototype, it is worthwhile to continue to refine the design of a DDC online catalog; (5) displays of related terms will be a valuable search enhancement in future online catalogs; and (6) LCC will eventually be made machine-readable.

An examination of the citations of articles in the Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index from a given year to the year in which the cited article was published reveals a pattern. The percentage is initially small when there is no lag between the years; it then increases, reaching a peak in less than two years. Then, it gradually decreases over time. A mathematical model was developed to describe this pattern, which, when tested, explains between 96.9% and 98.3% of the variance, depending on the data set. The results, which are presented in tabular form, are interpreted as an  example of social learning and forgetting. Findings are illustrated in five graphs, and references are provided. (Author/KM)",

As part of the requirements definition for an automated system to support the STI network, a questionnaire was sent to 238 users, who were asked to rank 25 functions as essential, useful, or marginal in an automated system and provide information on library characteristics. On the basis of the responses received from 85 organizations (a response rate of 36%), it was determined that available technologies should be assembled  into an integrated system running on one computer and accessible by any user over a single video display terminal. Initiated at the request of the Shared Bibliographic Input Network (SBIN) member libraries, the development of such a system became the objective of the Local Automation Model project, which will offer libraries and information centers a fully resident computer system supporting local collection cataloging, retrieval, and circulation management and control. In addition, the system's intelligent gateway will allow users to interconnect and share information with geographically remote, heterogeneous computers and databases, thus reducing the duplication of intellectual and manual effort associated with acquiring new STI holdings. Survey results are discussed, and the  characteristics of the survey respondents are presented in 12 bar charts. References are also provided. (KM)",

The system prototype, which has been under development since April 1983, will be used to demonstrate and evaluate the advantages of combining an integrated library system with an intelligent gateway capable of simultaneously querying and updating heterogeneous bibliographic databases using a  common command language. Users will be able to download and post-process data from external sources, thus allowing them to tailor search results to their patrons' needs economically and efficiently.

Questionnaires were mailed to 455 public libraries in the state of Texas, and 195 (43%) were returned. Analysis of the information gathered indicates that few persons who are currently providing services to preschool children in public libraries have training in the area of early childhood education sufficient to assist them in providing the most effective kinds of services, and that preschool services in Texas  libraries--which suffer from a lack of sufficient funding and trained staff--hold a low priority among library services. A discussion of selected literature is provided, and conclusions and suggestions are enumerated. The survey instrument and cover letter are appended, and a selected bibliography is provided. (KM)",

This study focused on how the agencies have (1) organized their Privacy Act activities, and (2) followed selected provisions of the Act and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines. GAO found that agencies have taken highly decentralized approaches to implementing the law, and often have not established clear lines of responsibility and accountability for Privacy Act functions. As a result of the study, GAO made a number of recommendations to the OMB  for improvement in oversight, agency evaluation, and certain OMB guidelines pertaining to such activities as computer matching programs.

        "description":"Upward mobility in the field of community college administration is affected by factors such as educational and social preparation, professional experience, the vita or resume, and an individual's preparation for a job opportunity. For most community college presidencies, a doctorate from an accredited, preferably non-experiential, institution is required, and selection committees are always going to look for some academic work in the community college. In terms of social preparation, consciousness of regional differences in values and social mores is important, as are the abilities to chat informally in social situations and to speak before a large group. Professional work experience is probably more important than the doctoral degree, with breadth and variety of experience  adding to marketability. Experiences that are valued by search committees include those that demonstrate an ability to deal with personnel, an awareness of fiscal responsibility, an ability to plan and evaluate programs and services, and background in student and program development and community education. Of vital importance in demonstrating these experiences and abilities to the search committee is the vita or resume. It should be brief, clear, concise, and easy to read; it should include major honors, academic experience, association memberships, and significant accomplishments, along with some personal demographics and employment experience. The key to getting an interview for the position is a resume that attracts the attention of the search committee. Before the interview, the  applicant should study the position, learning about the outgoing president, reviewing the audits and financial reports of the institution, reading news clippings, looking at the governance structure, and deciding whether he/she really wants the position.

The study involved a survey of 160 local corporations with subsidiaries in France or French-speaking countries, government agencies, and service organizations for foreign visitors or students. A questionnaire was developed to gather information on the companies' current or projected need for bilingual employees, functional areas of employment, French language proficiency and areas of skills desired, and interest in offering training and supervision for student interns. Survey findings, based on responses from 113 firms, included the following: (1)  approximately half of the respondents indicated a current as well as projected need for bilingual employees (French/English) with academic preparation in business administration; (2) the functional areas of business in which bilingual employees were generally utilized were marketing, secretarial/clerical, administrative services, and finance; (3) government agencies most frequently used bilingual employees in the laws and regulations department, while service agencies indicated that their greatest needs were in secretarial/clerical work, escorting foreign visitors, and providing housing services for foreign students; (4) the language proficiency level most desired by the respondents was \"professional\"; (5) employees were most likely to use their language skills in translating letters and  documents, reading technical documents, and interpreting spoken language; and (6) 57 of the firms were willing to offer support services for a beginning internship program. Given support from the business community and the college administration, further steps were taken in the development of the internship program. The study report includes a literature review on internship programs, foreign language teaching, and language skill job qualifications, along with an extensive bibliography and the survey instrument.

        "description":"A major reason for the paucity of usable data on the contributions and effectiveness of community colleges is that the definitions on which the data are based are imprecise. Colleges' contributions might be better understood if their functions were reconceptualized. The collegiate dimension of community colleges (i.e, that portion of the curriculum stemming from the liberal arts and the services designed to promote transfer) does not resemble the contemplative, text-centered courses that are held as the university ideal, but instead is oriented towards general education. While the collegiate dimension of the community college serves the general education function well, it is inappropriate to characterize this curriculum as a transfer program. The fact that a class carries  transfer credit is an artifact of college accreditation, staffing, and financing, having little to do with the perceptions, goals, or intentions of the students who are enrolled. To differentiate curriculum content from student intent, the curriculum could be characterized as comprising liberal arts (i.e., science, social science, humanities, and fine and performing arts) and skills (i.e., basic, recreational, occupational) courses. Students' intentions can be determined by asking the students to indicate whether they are attending college at this time to: (1) prepare for transfer to a four-year college or university; (2) gain skills necessary to enter a new occupation; (3) gain skills necessary to retrain, remain current, or advance in a current occupation; or (4) satisfy a personal  interest. By separating questions of curriculum content from student intent, both may be assessed more accurately. (LAL)",

Final grades awarded to students in ENG 090 (a non-credit developmental writing course) and ENG 110 (the required freshman composition course) were examined, yielding the following results: (1) of the 1,673 students enrolled in the two courses in fall 1985, 76.1% finished with a grade of D or better; (2) the passing rate in ENG 110 (78.3%) was higher than that for ENG 090 (47.6%); (3) 14.6% of the ENG 090 students withdrew and 21.8% failed the course, compared with 16.5% of the  ENG 110 students who withdrew and 4.5% who failed; (4) among regular admits, 81.10% passed the courses, 1.88% failed, 15.98% withdrew, and 1.04% received an incomplete; (5) among late admits, 50.43% passed, 26.92% failed, 19.23% withdrew, and 3.42% received an incomplete; and (6) among late admits, 52.8% passed ENG 110, but only 38.5% passed ENG 090.

This monograph provides the resulting policy statement, as well as papers developed to stimulate interest in and encourage the continued study of the humanities in the two-year college. Following a preface by Dale Parnell describing the objectives and outcomes of the roundtable, Judith S. Eaton provides an introductory overview of the topic of humanities instruction in community colleges. The policy statement, \"The Study of the Humanities in Community, Technical, and Junior Colleges,\" as adopted by the AACJC Board of Directors on April  12, 1986, is presented next. The next paper, \"Staking a Claim to the Future: Humanities Studies in our Community Colleges,\" by Tziporah Kasachkoff and Joshua L. Smith, offers a critique of William Bennett's 1984 report, \"To Reclaim a Legacy: A Report on the Humanities in Higher Education.\" Responses to the Humanities Policy Statement are offered by Arthur M. Cohen and Florence B. Brawer in \"The Humanities Revisited,\" which compares the 1985 recommendations with those of AACJC's 1979 Assembly on Strengthening the Humanities; and by W. J. Megginson in \"A Reaction from the Community College Humanities Association.\" The final paper, \"Kirkwood Community College: A Humanities Case Study,\" by Rhonda Kekke and Terry Moran describes the college's efforts to integrate the study of humanities into  its varied curricula.

The study sought to demonstrate that state funding for PCC yields high economic dividends for Colorado, and that public higher education institutions can be accountable in terms of measurable economic outcomes. The study utilized a basic economic impact model which measures direct expenditures including the college budget (less wages and financial aid), faculty and staff wages (less benefits and withholding taxes), student financial aid awarded, and spending by college visitors. Indirect expenditures included the average wages from jobs in new verified small businesses assisted by the college, and the actual wages from jobs  created by six new industries to which PCC contributed. The results of the study indicated: (1) PCC made a 333% direct return on the total state general fund and student financial aid investment; (2) PCC made a 1,552% return on the total state investment when indirect economic impact is included; (3) the direct economic impact of PCC was $13,259,036; and (4) the indirect impact of the college was $48,426,158.

The project involved the exploration of non-traditional sources for data, including in-state private university transfers, out-of-state university transfers, state university system course file tapes, and Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) Files. A new research instrument, the Employer  Evaluation Scale, was designed to collect data suited to institutional needs. Efforts to reduce the number of students in the \"unknown\" category identified 436 MDCC transfer students attending private colleges and 268 students attending out-of-state universities. Because of legal restrictions, INS files could not be used to gather information on foreign students. The newly designed Employer Evaluation Scale instrument provided useful monitoring data as well as state-of-the-art and state-of-the-market data. Several follow-up questionnaires are appended.

Approximately 200 kindergarten through second-grade children were first tested individually for their understanding of projective spatial concepts. Children were given a perspective-taking task in which colored disks and cylinders replaced the traditional papier-mache mountains, and were asked which of six photographs had been taken from specified locations around the array. Additionally, children were shown a series of locations on a model of a landscape and were asked to reproduce those locations on an identical model, once when the  two models were in spatial alignment and once when the child's model had been rotated by 180 degrees. With an exception or two, results showed the anticipated patterns of lower performance for unaligned rather than aligned conditions. Children were later given a variety of mapping tasks as part of their regular classroom instruction. Data from the directional mapping tasks were consistent with predictions based on Piagetian theory. (RH)",

        "description":"The first part of this paper describes three models of child development, each of which recommends an appropriate role to mothers for the proper nurturance of children. It is argued that the Child Survival model, which relegates a mother's role to provision of food and physical care, ignores aspects of psychological development. The Freudian/Learning Theory model leads to the conclusion that if children are not under the exclusive care of their mothers, they will not develop properly. The Maturational model implies that children can develop well with a variety of caretakers, providing good quality care is given. Of the three, the Maturational theory is most supported by research findings. Implications of these three models for working mothers and children are discussed. The  second part proposes that maternal role satisfaction is an important variable to consider when the intersecting needs of working mothers and their children are examined. Discussion explores ways in which four factors (attitudes toward economic and family roles, conditions of mothers' work, adequacy of child care, and social opinions/support of family and cultural norms) relate to women's role satisfaction and their children's welfare. Particular attention is given to findings concerning child care and labor force participation in developing countries. Policy recommendations are offered, along with an extensive bibliography. (RH)",

A total of 156 subjects between 5 and 9 years of age, inclusive, participated in the study. Subjects were required to predict the direction a beam would tip when different numbers of weights were placed at differing distances from the fulcrum. Seven increasingly sophisticated rules for prediction have been distinguished. On the basis of pretest rule use, children were assigned to one of three treatment conditions: individuals retested as controls, an &quot;equal rule&quot; group pairing subjects who used the same rule, and an &quot;unequal  rule&quot; group pairing subjects who used different rules. Children in each pair were of the same age, sex, and class in school. During the treatment phase, disagreements in prediction were resolved by discussion. The first posttest was administered approximately 3 days later and the second, 1 month later. Pairs did only slightly better than control individuals. Equal rule pairs did not show signs of development. Among unequal rule pairs, &quot;lower partners&quot; improved and &quot;higher partners&quot; declined. Concluding discussion examines three possible explanatory factors: amount of arguments, quality of reasoning, and cognitive state of the child. (RH)",

Discussion began with an overview of the range of options facing policymakers as they attempt to design legislation or write regulations to govern state-funded programs. Following the overview, three states were featured for an in-depth look at their experience in designing and implementing early childhood legislation: South Carolina, Massachusetts, and Illinois. Concluding discussion focused on curriculum issues including the relative merit of different curriculum models, quality programs in the public schools, and the need for a comprehensive, systematic  curriculum based on accepted child development principles.

        "description":"Three papers have been collected dealing with basic aspects of early childhood education: professionalism, child development, and knowledge dissemination. The first paper, &quot;The Nature of Professions: Where Is Early Childhood Education?&quot; applies eight main features of the concept of a profession to the current state of the art of early childhood education including social necessity, altruism, autonomy, a code of ethics, distance from clients, standards of practice, prolonged training, and specialized knowledge. The second paper, &quot;Current Perspectives on Child Development,&quot; highlights aspects of development that seem to have fairly clear implications for pedagogical and curriculum decisions. Topics are presented in the form of broad general principles that seem to apply to many  aspects of child growth and behavior: optimum influences; the recursive cycle of development; and the development of dispositions, particularly the disposition to become interested and motivated to learn. The third paper, &quot;Issues in the Dissemination of Child Development Knowledge,&quot; describes five issues related to the dissemination of information in general as well as information about child development in particular. Issues are related to the information flow; the conceptual scope of the ideas presented; the vividness of the presentation; the timeliness of concepts; and the orientations to knowledge characteristic of the scientists and practitioners involved in the information dissemination.

A total of 159 subjects ranging in age from 6 through 12 years were asked to provide an open-ended response to 16 test metaphors which varied in difficulty. The metaphors were presented either with a 60- to 100-word-story context or as simple sentences. Metaphor comprehension was operationalized as type and number of grounds used in constructing conjunctive, disjunctive, and/or relational categories when interpreting a metaphor. Children's responses were coded to indicate type of comprehension: perceptually grounded, conceptually grounded, and combined perceptually and  conceptually grounded comprehension. Findings replicated Siltanen's results concerning age differences and cognitive elaboration of comprehension, and supported the four-stages theory of metaphor comprehension. However, contrary to other research, context did not significantly affect metaphor comprehension. Results are discussed in terms of metaphor difficulty, type of context, and power of the manipulation. (Author/RH)",

Data were derived from longitudinal observations of 1 girl and 1 boy twin individually interacting with 21 somewhat or totally unfamiliar adults at 2- or 3-week intervals from the age of 4 to 15 months, inclusive. Videotapes of interactions were viewed by four observers paired randomly and working independently. Findings indicated an increase in agreement between observers as infants grew older. The manner in which babies attempted to influence adults suggested that babies as young as 4 to 6 months of age may engage multiple means to use adults to implement goals. While babies at the earliest age use adults as tools without obvious acknowledgement of the existence of the  other as a person, babies as young as 6 months may use more sophisticated strategies that are less direct and more communicative, such as self-initiated eye contact and symbolic gestures. It is not until the end of the first year that the infants used sustained and complex conventional symbols such as symbolically demonstrating the action to be performed or using words or nods. All the infants, even the youngest, were persistent. (RH)",

Subjects were 64 kindergarten children and 65 first grade public school students from lower to upper middle class socioeconomic levels, of whom 66 were male, 63 were female, 78 were Caucasian, and 51 were black. Two assessment instruments were used: (1) a basic concepts assessment task involving simple object sorting, class extension, and cross classification; and (2) a social concepts assessment task designed to measure subjects' knowledge of nine basic social concepts (young/old, urban/rural, family/not family, past/present, rich/poor, war/peace, groups/individuals, houses/other buildings, and people who protect us/other people). Profile analysis was used to  compare grade, sex, and racial groups. All three variables had a significant impact on performance. Significant differences in difficulty were found among the nine concepts measured. Three of the most difficult concepts (family/not family, those who protect us/other people, and past/present) are commonly included in the early childhood curriculum. These results suggest the need for consideration of concept development level in planning the social studies curriculum and instruction for young children. (Author/RH)",

A total of 16 normal families having 1 child between 1 and 3 years of age and a newborn child were observed monthly in unstructured situations in their homes over a period of 2 years. When the youngest child was about 5 years of age, both children in each family were given intelligence tests. Tape recorded observations were split into episodes 20 to 40 seconds in duration and scored according to categories covering different domain of family interaction. Data from 7 families were cross classified and analyzed as to general trends of changes and continuity during the 2-year period. Verbal intelligence scores of each family's two children at  at preschool/school age were used as guidelines for a longitudinal follow-down approach. Four families whose children had high scores on verbal intelligence tests and four families with low scoring children were selected from the total sample. The two contrasting groups were used for exploring salient differences in family-specific socialization activities during the early years. Results of general trend analyses point to an age-specific adaptation rhythm of family dynamics during the 2-year period. Results from the study of contrasting groups point to family- and age-specific socialization patterns during the early years. (Author/RH)",

Data were collected from fall 1979 through spring 1982. Subjects, enrolled in the third grade during the 1979-80 school year, were followed through their fourth and fifth grade years. The sample also included children who entered school in the fall of 1980, at the beginning of their fourth grade year. Additional data were collected from parents, teachers, other professional staff, and school and district administrators. Findings indicated that the variables included in the analyses were not particularly helpful in understanding students' gains in reading and mathematics.  Findings further emphasize the complexity of human learning and the uniqueness of individual learners. Neither time-on-task in reading or mathematics nor time spent on homework was a potent predictor of student gain. Students of teachers who held a graduate degree did less well than students whose teachers did not have a graduate degree. Teachers' attitudes and beliefs were at least as important as other teacher characteristics. Finally, students' academic aptitude was not as potent a predictor of student gain in reading and mathematics as might be expected. (RH)",

Using a global rating system and a molecular coding strategy, 38 trained observers coded occluded and unoccluded versions of four videotapes, two of which were of attractive targets and two of unattractive targets. Findings indicated that the observers were significantly and favorably biased toward attractive women, when making global judgments about behavioral interactions. No bias was obtained, however, when observers used a molecular coding strategy. The results demonstrate the need to be cautious about  employing and interpreting global ratings and suggest that molecular coding techniques may insulate observers from bias due to the attractiveness of the observed person.

A total of 2 years of monthly videotaped observations of interaction in family constellations among spouses with their 12- to 42-month-old first child and newborn second child identified normal constellations of interaction and a &quot;deviant&quot;  pattern in one family. Analysis particularized the origin of the unique pattern of interaction in the mother's relationship with each of her children. Quantitative findings were subsequently used as background to guide qualitative case study analysis of interaction episodes in the deviant family.

        "description":"The general purpose of this year-long study was to evaluate the effects of the Edmonton Hospital Workers' Child Care Society programs in three Canadian hospitals on the employers, the employees, and the children served. Specifically, this study investigated the effects of employer-supported child care on (1) employee absenteeism; (2) tardiness; (3) recruitment; (4) retention/turnover; (5) productivity; (6) morale/attitude; (7) shiftwork; (8) awareness, use, and satisfaction with the program; and (9) families' and children's reactions and behavior changes. Data were collected via questionnaires, structured and non-structured interviews, on-site visits, and review of personnel and program records. Findings show that the employer-supported child care programs had no statistically  significant effect on absenteeism, tardiness, or recruitment. Statistically significant effects were found in employees' perceptions of lower stress levels, improved concentration on the job, working desired hours, being able to work part-time or full-time, scheduling vacation time, and being able to return to work after the birth of a child when the difficulties due to child-related responsibilities of parent-employees were compared to those of other hospital employees with children less than 13 years of age. These findings are considered to have implications for workers' productivity. (RH)",

        "description":"To help children develop social competence, teachers ought to understand differences between popular and unpopular children, know how to assess social competence, and employ techniques which aid the development of children's social skills. In general, popular children have developed skills and strategies which allow them to interact with their peers in various situations. Unpopular children engage in behaviors which are detrimental to peer interaction. Their behaviors and lack of skills increases the likelihood of peer rejection. Knowing how to interact with peers successfully is vitally important, for research shows that early popularity is associated with later positive outcomes, while early unpopularity is associated with later negative outcomes. To identify children who are  rejected, neglected, or popular, teachers can employ several methods, including sociometric ratings and rankings, the picture nomination technique, informal observations, and checklists such as the California Preschool Competency Scale. Teachers can also utilize several techniques to improve children's social skills. Such techniques include, among others, reinforcement through praise, structuring the social and physical environment to encourage positive social interactions, planning activites that promote social interaction, providing time for free play, and enhancing children's self esteem.

Subjects were assigned to reward or nonreward conditions and administered two ideational fluency tasks: an Unusual Uses task requiring subjects to name all the uses they could think of for a box and for paper, and a Pattern Meanings task asking subjects to name all the things that two three-dimensional objects could represent. Prior to the administration of the tasks, children in the reward condition were told they could select a prize of either bubbles or crayons. All responses were coded as either original or popular. Total fluency was computed by adding the number of popular and original responses.  Flexibility scores were derived from protocols for the picture completion subtest of the 1974 Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, Figural Form A. Analyses revealed a significant main effect for reward on the ideational fluency components of originality, total fluency, and flexibility. In all cases the rewarded subjects scored lower than the nonrewarded subjects. Findings support the growing body of evidence that rewards are detrimental to creative functioning.

        "description":"To assist state-level educational policy makers, information about the needs of rural adults and barriers to their participation in educational programs was studied in seven northwestern states. Telephone interviews gathered information from educational providers (approximately 6 in each state) and 47 rural adult learners from the region. In each state, responses were grouped separately for learners and providers under five types of barriers to participation: institutional, informational, psychological, personal/situational, and state policy. Comparisons were made across states and between learners and providers, and aggregate lists of barriers for the Northwest were constructed. Barriers listed by providers and learners, respectively, were highly similar across states. Learners'  and providers' estimates of the relative importance of specific barriers were much the same. Overwhelmingly, both groups felt that, when compared with their urban counterparts, rural adults do not have equal access to educational opportunities. The additional problems of rural learners included distance and transportation, increased costs, declining incomes, limited access to instructors and advisors, limited support services, and lack of access to materials and resources. This report includes specific recommendations for each state studied as well as recommendations in the areas of state policy, institutional procedures, community responsibilities, and rural education practitioner responsibilities.

        "description":"Based on research studies of effective staff development and rural education, the Inservice Leadership Team (ILT) was designed to identify key teachers in school buildings, team them with principals and central office staff, and train the team to design, deliver, and evaluate staff development at the school level. Rural Pennsylvania school staff, district administrators, and Pennsylvania State University faculty collaborated on the project. Team members received training over a 6 month period in competencies such as goal setting, needs assessment, and change process. Rural school faculty was divided into staff development teams of six to eight teachers with an ILT member serving as advisor and guiding each faculty member through development of a personal/professional growth plan  for the school year. Once teachers selected their inservice education topics, learning resource teams were formed by those teachers with common professional growth goals. Program evaluations indicated that 85% of the teachers implemented a new practice in their classrooms within 12 months of initiation of the ILT model of staff development. In addition, teachers' attitudes toward inservice education became more positive, relations between the school and the central office improved, and a high level of trust developed among rural teachers, administrators, and university faculty.

Findings indicated that 30% of the 861 freshmen who entered Urbana in 1981 withdrew before that class graduated in June 1985, with 30-50% leaving before the end of their freshman year. Of 179 confirmed dropouts and 86 long-term absent students at Northern between September 1985 and February 1986, 58% were Hispanic. According to student records, 63% &quot;left to seek employment,&quot; 33% left for unknown reasons, and only 8 left for school-related reasons dealing with grades,  curriculum, and relationships with teachers/peers. Equal numbers of boys and girls withdrew from school and pregnancy or marriage was listed for only 4 Urbana dropouts. Gross dropout figures miss students who do not return following summer vacations or become &quot;inactive.&quot; The study concluded that better recordkeeping is necessary for further research and intervention efforts. Centralized registration procedures, parent liaisons, and strong central administrative support for bilingual services have helped Northern do a better job of dropout intervention. (NEC)",

Data from the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the 1978 Census of Agriculture describe similarities and differences in social and technical arrangements of farms. A comparative analysis of production systems examines agricultural diversity in commodities produced, organizational characteristics of farms, personal characteristics of farm operators, and farm corporate structures. Discussion of the interchange between agricultural structures and rural communities includes impacts of farm population changes on rural communities and impacts of community growth on  farming. The report examines a U.S. Department of Agriculture proposal to establish four categories of farms based on farm sales as a focus for future research and extension policies and programs. Discussion of the strategy includes identification of proposed research and extension efforts in each category and a critique of the four-category approach. Farms as organizational units of production are examined for the nation as a whole and for 10 leading agricultural producing states, including Texas.

The resulting baseline was used to compare MIHOW program effectiveness, and to examine characteristics of women in poverty and how their poverty impacts maternal and infant health and health practices. The survey related measures of health care, status, and practices to resources, information, and access to care. Intermediate measures included adequacy of income to provide food at all times, type of support, sources of knowledge, and availability of  transportation. Findings suggested resources for low income women and children were too low and that community-based home visitor programs were appropriate to provide additional resources. The survey found birth weights, contraceptive use, prenatal care, and breastfeeding all below national averages. Female-headed households, nonemployment income sources, age, and race were significant determining factors.

This report describes the themes that emerged from the discussions at the conference. Four major recommendations were made by the group that were intended to encourage the development of an integrated research base in education. The recommendations are to: (1) establish centers for collaboration in science and mathematics education; (2) expand opportunities for sharing information and building communication networks; (3) increase the fundamental understanding of science learning and instruction; and  (4) strengthen the response of research in science education to real instructional needs. The bibliography includes a selected list of papers written by the participants and a set of review articles. (TW)",

Specifically, the study sought to determine the goals for mathematics and science which teachers of these subjects emphasize; the similarities and differences in attitudes toward and performance in mathematics and science by male and female, minority and nonminority students; and the possible link between teacher goals and student-level outcomes. Results showed that teachers in the study (N=133) often seemed unclear on how they could translate their overall goals into strategies that would prove effective for diverse students. The minority students in this study expressed favorable attitudes toward  mathematics and science but performed more poorly in those subjects than did their nonminority counterparts. It is recommended that future research attend to the range of factors in the classroom and in settings beyond that context, that make the outcomes for minority students quite different from those that are obtained by other students. Research on goals is also advocated. Appendices include the instruments employed in the study. (ML)",

Perceptions were documented by a questionnaire which included items reflecting the six major strands of the K-6 syllabi and explicit and implicit use of numbers and operations as both facilitating and distracting elements. Children were given a situation and asked whether the person in the situation was doing or using mathematics. Teachers' perceptions were identified through discussions of questionnaire content and results and taping of classroom discussions with students. The results showed that children's perceptions of the domain of mathematics, although constrained by an emphasis on topics of arithmetic, were reasonably amorphous and fluid and were  influenced by developmental factors, explicit numbers and operations, perceived difficulty and activity level of the situation, linguistic factors and experience.

The understanding that human beings bring to a task is contrasted with this algorithmic processing. In the second section, the question of understanding is related to learning algorithmic performance, with counting used as the vehicle. It is noted that perhaps subskills must be mastered algorithmically before understanding can develop; perhaps the separation between algorithmic performance and understanding is impossible at any stage of the learning. In the third section, two studies dealing with the relation between algorithmic performance and understanding are described. Both fail to demonstrate that understanding improves algorithmic performance. The fourth  section addresses the question of teaching for understanding and leaving algorithms to computers. Deciding what kind of division of labor we wish to establish between ourselves and our computers is the focal point. (MNS)",

        "description":"Formal educational environments often provide less support for learning than do the everyday environments available to young children. This paper considers the concept of idealized learning environments, defined as &quot;Havens.&quot; Various components of Havens are discussed that may facilitate comprehension, especially in science instruction. These components include: (1) the opportunity to learn in semantically rich contexts; (2) the availability of &quot;mediators&quot; who can guide learning; and (3) the importance of understanding how new knowledge can function as conceptual tools that facilitate problem solving. Three experiments were presented that suggest some of the advantages of learning in &quot;Haven-like&quot; environments. Two experiments were done with college students and one with junior  high school students. The experiments involve very simple uses of instructional technology, yet they showed positive results. The results suggest that more sophisticated use of technology, especially computer-controlled interactive videodiscs, should have even greater benefits on comprehension and other forms of learning. Some videodisc-based Havens that are being developed at Vanderbilt University are described. (Author/TW)",

        "author":["Wolf, Edward C."],
        "description":"After 20 years, the &quot;green revolution&quot; is generally referred to as a milestone in the international agricultural movement. The introduction of new varieties of wheat and rice, along with fertilizers, pesticides, and mechanized farm equipment has produced a dramatic increase in world food production. This paper assesses the successes of the green revolution in light of its effect upon third world countries. It cautions that the revolutionary gains in agricultural production have not been distributed evenly. This uneven distribution of productivity is discussed in the first chapter, &quot;Productivity Reconsidered.&quot; The second chapter, &quot;Beyond the Green Revolution,&quot; considers the need for new crop varieties and technologies (including biotechnologies) but argues that tomorrow's  innovations must be more consistent with regional agricultural traditions. This approach will help to avoid some of the environmental and social costs associated with the agricultural technologies utilized during the green revolution. The third chapter, &quot;Rediscovering Traditional Agriculture,&quot; examines the benefits and limitations of traditional methods of agriculture, indicating that these practices should provide the basis for new practices, rather than be swept aside as archaic. &quot;Toward Appropriate Biotechnology&quot; discusses some of the possible contributions offered by biotechnology as tools for more efficient and sustainable agriculture. The document concludes with a call for additional research in sustainable agriculture productivity. (TW)",

Special attention was directed toward identifying the nature of curricula planned in science for grades 5, 9, and 12 in order to develop valid items for the international testing program employed in SISS. An empirical study was designed to measure the relative emphasis given in curricula to science content and relevant cognitive, affective, and psychomotor objectives for grades 5, 9, and 12. Curricula grids were examined in the traditional science domains, in  applied/integrated science areas, and for science processes, skills, and attitudes. Information reported in this publication includes: (1) introductory statements (discussing science education in the United States); (2) study procedures (explaining study methodology and data analysis); (3) survey results (presenting and interpreting the data); and (4) science curriculum case study (discussing findings on aims, objectives, curriculum development and content, teacher education, science teaching and associated topics).

        "description":"An overview is first given of some main theoretical frameworks underlying current European research in mathematical thinking, learning, and teaching. Together with the information-processing and the (neo)-Piagetian approaches, both well known in the United States, two other research paradigms can be distinguished: the action-oriented approach to learning and instruction developed in the Soviet Union, and the so-called realistic approach. Each is described, with implications. In the next section, European research in the domain of elementary arithmetic word problems is discussed. The focus is on three topics: task characteristics, children's solution processes, and teaching experiments. It is demonstrated that this European research, which is largely unknown to American  scientists, has provided insights and findings some of which replicate those of recent American studies, but others of which provide criticisms and completions on this work. A list of 57 references is appended. (MNS)",

        "description":"Classroom decision-making was conceptualized within the framework of person-environment fit. A longitudinal sample of 2239 sixth graders in 117 mathematics classrooms were surveyed. The findings include: (1) students typically report fewer decision-making opportunities than they think they should have in their mathematics classrooms; (2) students within a classroom tend to agree among themselves concerning decision-making prerogatives that actually do exist, but there is less consensus concerning prerogatives that should exist; (3) congruence on these &quot;can decide&quot; and &quot;should decide&quot; dimensions is associated with positive values and affect concerning mathematics as well as high effort and expectancies for success in mathematics; (4) congruence in mathematics classrooms is not  related in the same way to similar outcomes in social and athletic activity domains; (5) congruence is inversely related to student misbehavior at school; and (6) these effects of decision-making congruence persist even after controlling for the level of actual decision-making opportunities in the classroom. Since past research has demonstrated that children's values and expectancies predict significant educational outcomes, the findings of this study imply that educators should work toward increasing their students' decision-making congruence in mathematics. Thirty-two references, four tables, and the study instrument are appended. (Author/HNS)",

The study employed the instrument, Views on Science-Technology-Society (VOSTS), which required students to write an argumentative paragraph responding to one of 46 statements about an STS topic. The target population consisted of graduating high school students (N=10,800) throughout Canada. Responses from a stratified random sampling were analyzed by three researchers and the response categories were established from students' arguments in the paragraphs. This paper primarily focuses on the instrument's format and validity and the research issues associated with this type of study. Actual results of the study are reported in  related papers. Implications of the study are discussed in terms of: (1) strategies to improve understanding of student views on STS topics; (2) research possibilities; and (3) ideas for classroom teachers.

In preparing the report, the department used data solicited from county offices of education and school districts, community organizations, other state departments of education, and students. It also reviewed current literature on nuclear age education. Recommendations were made in two broad areas. First, the Legislature should provide resources for the State Department of Education to: (1) develop in-service activities for teachers, administrators, and parents;  (2) increase the coverage of nuclear age topics in teachers' and students' publications; and (3) work with community groups to ensure a balanced, unbiased approach to nuclear age education. Second, the Legislature should encourage school districts to: (1) provide release time and opportunities for in-service training; (2) incorporate nuclear age instruction in all appropriate subject areas; and (3) involve parent and community groups to ensure a balanced, unbiased approach. The appendixes include Assembly Bill Number 3848, survey materials, and a nine-page listing of books, studies, periodicals, and curriculum guides and other resources. (BZ)",

Children are particularly at risk from toxic substances because their bodies are small and still developing. They often do not understand the dangers associated with a product and they have a tendency to put things in their mouths. Ingredients of each product were reviewed by the Center for Occupational Hazards. Products were placed in one of three groups; (1) should not be used in public schools; (2) should be used  only in secondary schools; and (3) safe for use in all public schools. Three recommendations were made: (1) art and craft materials should be required to be labeled properly; (2) certain toxic materials should be eliminated from the public schools; and (3) training sessions concerning toxic art supplies should be required. Appendices include: \"Art materials that children under 12 should not use, with substitutes\"; \"Text of Oregon House Bill 2992\"; and \"Products authorized to bear the CP Certified Products Seal and the AP Approved Product Seal of the Certified Products and Certified Labeling Bureau of the Art and Craft Materials Institute, Inc.\" (BZ)",

The &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial page shared in this trend: moving cautiously from complete rejection of the Soviets to acceptance of the Russian people, next the Red Army, and finally the Soviet government. The &quot;Times&quot; was probably no more naive, no more idealistic, and no more expedient than any other leading newspaper in this country. Yet it provides a sample case study of the build-up of United States-Soviet cordiality. Post-war reaction against the Soviet Union would have been less intense if it had been based upon a more realistic foundation. An artificial Soviet Union had been created--a Soviet Union which was capitalistic, nationalistic, and  religious. When the war ended and the Soviet policy was redirected, many realized that Stalin's ideas were no more amenable to western democracy than were Lenin's ideas. The judgments of the &quot;Times,&quot; first in its attacks and later in its acceptance of the Soviet Union, were only a reflection of the judgments of the people of the United States in international affairs.

The editorialists of &quot;The New York Times&quot; (probably the most influential newspaper in the United States) were in accord with public sentiment in regarding the military cooperation of the Soviet Union as a blessing offered as a result of expediency and, therefore, as something to be accepted with the same expedient outlook. The heroic defense of Stalingrad late in 1942 gave both the Russian people and the Soviet regime higher status in the eyes of the United States public. Henceforth, &quot;The New York Times&quot;  editorials were devoted to researching and presenting similarities between the Soviet Union and the United States rather than differences. Since sentiment marched steadily from opposition to support--from hatred to idealization--it was questionable whether the United States was realistic in its international affairs during the 18 months under consideration.

Concepts, or units of knowledge and understanding, and study  approaches, or means by which objectives can be reached, are described for each objective. The first section of the program contains scope and sequence charts of objectives for each grade level separated into the three aspects of art learning. The charts show the sequential, developmental nature of learning in these three aspects from grade to grade and illustrate the relationships among the areas for each level.

Various aspects of time in the school setting are presented and their implications for curriculum and instruction are discussed. A distinction is made between instructional time, curricular time, sociological time, and experienced, personal time. These distinctions do not represent a full and comprehensive framework for the study of time, but serve as constructs guiding the discussion of time as a commonplace in education. The paper argues that time constitutes a special  commonplace, not to be subsumed under the four commonplaces mentioned above. Part of the potential knowledge base and body of experience needed to represent this commonplace is noted, and implications for research, curriculum development, and teacher education are made.

The educational practices and conditions which contribute to a supportive environment are examined and four suggestions for effective teaching strategies (role playing, puppets, creative writing, and individualized reading) are offered. The chapters  include: &quot;Moral Education as a Variety of Educational Approaches&quot;; &quot;Climate and Atmosphere of the Classroom&quot;; &quot;The Role of the Teacher&quot;; &quot;Teaching Strategies&quot;; and &quot;Formation of Conscience.&quot; Each chapter contains a summary and suggested readings.

Four categories of exercises were considered beginning with the simplest and progressing to the more complex. The first set of exercises required students to interpret tornado data. The second set utilized maps and posed questions about the frequency of tornadoes and associated fatalities. The third set required students to graph data and interpret trend lines in order to understand relationships. The fourth set used the Spearman Rank Correlation to confirm suspected spatial relationships examined in earlier exercises. The sample questions developed for each of the exercises served as examples of  what could be done with tornado statistics. It is hoped that the questions and data will encourage users to expand on existing exercises, as well as to develop new ones for the classroom. Six tables of tornado data and corresponding maps are included. (Author/APG)",

Efficient and equitable economic mechanisms are central components of the concept. Analyzing issues complicated by politics, ideology, and nationalism, sustainable economics scholars attempt to explore what works to make resource use more efficient, how people behave in relation to resources, and how a country's economic system can alter its prospects for survival. In this paper an answer for survival is sought through an examination of the performance of various countries throughout the world in agricultural efficiency/food security, energy efficiency, environmental pollution, and equity. Central to these topics is the changing  reliance on the market, which should have significant human and environmental consequences. It is also contended that efficient food production and energy consumption make the best indicators of progress toward sustainable economics. It is concluded that many countries are reorienting their economies but that over-optimism about efficiency is not justified in view of the many problems that remain. Ten tables and 4 figures illustrate the topics in question. (TRS)",

The challenge for HRD is to recognize the economic, social, and cultural changes that are occurring and to provide leadership for the quickly emerging economy to keep up with expectations being instilled in youth. Recognizing that economic projections are not sacred, HRD must further recognize that, in terms of absolute growth, jobs that are not particularly glamorous nor highly technological will show the greatest actual growth. HRD must accordingly help train for these non-technological  jobs. It is cautioned that unless HRD directs long-term growth to include the training of less skilled workers, our economy and culture will be severely burdened. A table of projected employment growth from 1979 to 1990 highlights the challenge to HRD. (TRS)",

        "description":"Academic freedom for precollegiate teachers in the United States is less clear than that expressed and confirmed in law and custom for college faculties. The question studied was how academic freedom is perceived in theory and practice by secondary school teachers outside of the United States. The interview schedule was modeled after schedules used in interview studies in secondary schools in New Jersey, California, and Cambridge, England. This study involved nine social studies teachers in a suburban secondary school near Perth, Australia. The responses found that Australian and United States teachers were essentially similar in their views of academic decision-making, their own academic freedom, and the kinds of restrictions on topics. United States respondents consistently  identified other teachers as more conservative than themselves, regardless of their self-identification on a spectrum. The Australian respondents, however, identified other teachers as having more liberal political views than their own. There was a general feeling among Australian respondents that academic freedom for teachers was not an issue. United States interviewees in previous studies were much more sensitive to local politics, parent groups, and incidents where academic freedom had been compromised by administrators or boards. Interviewees were also questioned concerning the length of their teaching experience, subjects of preparation, and current teaching subject. (BZ)",

Impressive accomplishments of the Japanese system are described. For example, nearly everyone completes a rigorous core curriculum during 9 compulsory years of schooling, about 90 percent of the students graduate from high school, academic achievement tends to be high, and schools contribute substantially to national economic strength. Reasons for Japanese successes include: clear purposes rooted deeply in the culture, well-defined and challenging curricula, well-ordered learning environments, high expectations for student achievement, strong motivation and effective study habits of students, extensive  family involvement in the mission of schools, and high status of teachers. Problems and criticisms are noted, including inattention to variations in students' abilities and needs, rigidity and uniformity of the system, and insufficient concern for development of creative and independent thinking. Current education reform efforts are described. Implications of this report for U.S. education are discussed in a special Epilogue by U.S. Secretary of Education, William J. Bennett, who endorses several qualities of the Japanese system, such as high standards for all students, cultural literacy developed through the school curriculum, and strong parental involvement in the education of their children. A glossary and appendix containing statistical data, a bibliography, a list of papers  commissioned for the United States Study of Education in Japan, basic references, brief facts about Japan, and a map of Japan conclude the document. Appended are the U.S. Press Release (dated January 3, 1987) announcing release of the report and the matching Japanese statement announcing release of the counterpart Japanese report entitled &quot;Educational Reform in the United States.&quot; (JP)",

The first includes reforms such as requirements for a full liberal arts program for teacher candidates, a fifth year of professional education, a carefully supervised induction, and tests of subject-matter knowledge, professional knowledge, and performance. The second scenario examines the consequences of a continuation of today's policies for teacher education and practices that have not been effective in the past. The third scenario is drawn on a parallel with the model of the United States Army during the era when the draft existed. A permanent, relatively high-paid cadre of experienced professional teachers inducting, training, and supervising contingents of continuously changing temporary teachers. Temporary teachers  would be secured through one of several plans: (1) mandated public service; (2) college loan forgiveness; (3) voluntary Peace-Corps-like teaching corps; or (4) high beginning salaries on a scale which fails to reward experience. The possibilities inherent in the final scenario are considered. (JD)",

Data were gathered on 1,540 students from Central Washington University, Eastern Washington University, University of Washington, Washington State University, and Western Washington University. Four broad categories of data were included: (1) certification data--basic demographic information and information on the type of certificate granted and levels for which the certificate was endorsed; (2) academic data--dates of graduation and program completion, cumulative and major grade point averages, and  student majors and minors; (3) admissions test data--composite verbal and quantitative scores on the Washington Pre-College Test; and (4) initial employment data--students' employment status in the fall of 1983. All of each sampled student's university course work was classified in ten broad subject categories according to the departments by which the courses were offered. Within each category, courses completed were further classified as education-related or non-education-related, depending upon the course titles and catalog descriptions. Data are accompanied by narrative discussion. Numerous tables are provided. (JD)",

Each of these goals is discussed in the light of what will actually be required in the way of action and implementation in schools of education.

        "description":"An evaluation of adult basic education (ABE) programs was conducted in North Carolina, using a case study approach. Research was done by six teams that collected information from taped interviews with participants in six programs chosen to represent rural and urban areas and various demographic and racial mixes of students. Materials and records provided by the programs were also studied. The result is an extensive narrative report of the students' feelings and opinions as well as feedback from instructors. In addition, conclusions were drawn and recommendations made. Some of the conclusions were that ABE in North Carolina is meeting the needs of a percentage of those adults in the state who appear to be appropriate for the services. However, the study suggests that some policy  and programmatic changes are necessary. The study found that students appreciate the program's existence and the instructors' concern; instructors like their jobs and their administrators. Administrators are committed to ABE and like the state personnel's responsiveness. However, instructors in local programs are unaware of how their efforts compare with those of other instructors; administrators often are not aware of how their programs compare with others; and the state staff questions the usefulness of lessons to be learned from other states. There is a theme of isolation in the name of autonomy. Therefore, recommendations have been made in regard to both training and policy. New funds are necessary to make these changes. Three pages of references and copies of the design proposal, the  interview and observation guide, and the participants' interview guide and data sheets are appended. (KC)",

        "description":"In order to determine the nature and prevalence of learning deficiencies among adult inmates in U.S. correctional institutions, a sample of subjects was drawn from three institutions in each of the states of Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Washington. One male maximum security, one male medium security, and one women's prison were selected in each of the three states. Subjects were administered an academic achievement test and an individual intelligence test. Those scoring at or below the fifth-grade level on one of the subtests were deemed to be \"learning deficient\" and administered a learning disabilities screening test. Subjects with a full-scale IQ of less than 75 were given an adaptive behavior checklist. Data were collected on demographic, family, educational, and criminal  justice variables. Findings indicated that the average inmate left school after 10th grade but was performing more than 3 years below this level. At least 42 percent of inmates have some form of learning deficiency, and, of those, 82 percent had indications of specific learning disabilities, especially in the area of auditory and visual discrimination. A substantial number of those identified as learning deficient had been identified previously but little appears to have been done to intervene. It was further found that 70 percent came from unstable home environments and many indicated childhood problems including drug and alcohol abuse and delinquency. Half had no regular employment prior to incarceration. When the relationship between the variables was explored, the most consistent  predictor of achievement and measured ability was the highest grade completed. When the analyses were done for the learning deficient versus non-learning deficient sample, ethnic group was the most consistent in explaining the variance. A number of policy recommendations were made as a result of the study. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Eleventh- and twelfth-grade students in California comprehensive high schools and Regional Occupational Centers/Programs spend about one million hours a day on vocational education. California students who took a concentrated sequence of high school vocational subjects during 1981 had a 26 percent unemployment rate in the spring of 1982, compared to a 23 percent unemployment rate among all 16- to 19-year-olds and 27 percent unemployment rate among high school dropouts. Evidently, high school vocational training did not give students any relative advantage in finding jobs after they graduated, nor was it effective in dropout prevention. Furthermore, there is no evident way in which reallocating resources among existing high school vocational programs would bring about much  improvement in labor market outcomes for graduates. Instead, fundamental changes should be made in vocational education at the secondary level. Comprehensive high schools should stop trying to provide skill training for entry-level jobs and instead should use vocational education to prepare young people for a working life of continual learning, problem solving, and communicating. To accomplish this broader purpose, vocational education should include all students at some point in their high school career. The success of vocational education in high schools should be measured by improved performance in academic subjects, lower dropout rates, and lifelong gains in productivity at work. (KC)",

        "description":"Limited English proficient adults represent a special population group served by the federally funded Adult Education Act. Usually, limited English speakers attend English as a second language (ESL) classes offered by state and local agencies. In the last decade, changes in the approach to ESL instruction have deemphasized academic ESL and focused instead on providing job-related English as a second language. Many parallels exist between program designs for bilingual vocational training and adult basic education-English as a second language classes because the adult learners in both cases are of limited English proficiency and because their educational needs or goals are similar. The overall purpose of adult education is to enable participants to function better in society. For  most adults, second language learning should be based on the communication and life coping skills needed on the job and outside the classroom. The products developed for the federally funded bilingual vocational training program are valuable resources for use by educators who work with limited English proficient adults. Because the products have been field tested with limited English proficient adults--and have been shown to work--the job-related English as a second language program strategies and practices described in these products are valuable to ESL teachers. These strategies can improve adult basic education and ESL classes for adults who are limited English proficient. Research and programs concerning teaching limited English speaking persons are described in this paper. A  bibliography is appended. (KC)",

These partnerships already are involved with bringing about and sustaining excellence in education and can become more so. Such relationships can enhance student learning and development and can also reap positive results for the business community. Programs vary and may include such activities as business-sponsored advertisements emphasizing positive aspects of education within the community, having professional people assist high school students with individual projects, having employees serve in a teaching or instructional capacity in the schools, and business recognition of outstanding teachers. Business sees the benefits of a prepared  work force. Educators must be willing to overcome their apprehension of the outside community coming into the schools. Carefully planned and executed school/business partnerships can be very beneficial. These activities can bring additional resources to schools, provide a working relationship among diverse elements in the community, enhance the education profession, and better develop productivity and academic excellence within the schools.

However, uncontrollable external forces are going to be dominant in determining America's destiny. To be effective the nation must respond quickly to these changes: the shift from a manufacturing to a service economy, an increasing number of minorities, and increased immigration. Interesting changes are consequently emerging in post-high school people and educational programs. Business has created a large postsecondary education system, corporations run colleges, and a large portion of the middle-age population is being educated. Three demographic factors that must be considered as they relate to the work setting are a potential worker's age, region, and race. Baby boomers are the  most important age group, and a middle-aged society is emerging. The Sunbelt is characterized by increased youth populations, and a much higher proportion of the youth cohort is nonwhite. The Midwest is aging rapidly. Blacks are concentrated in the Southeast, Hispanics in the Southwest. The economy is moving toward a work force of a few highly paid executive and professional people and a large group of low-level service workers. The issues surrounding the \"declining middle\" are vital. (YLB)",

        "description":"For many practitioners, reading about or doing research is not seen as a viable means by which to learn about human behavior. In reaction to the non-utility view of research, a number of writers have questioned the validity of the scientist-practitioner model, or reinterpreted the model, or asked psychologists to reconsider the philosophy of science. Another alternative is for educators to examine and evaluate their training goals. Students may not be adopting research in their behavior repertoire and may not be acquiring a philosophical perspective on the value of research. There are several methods for training doctoral students in counseling psychology in the use of research findings. Research training could be improved by: (1) teaching applications; (2) teaching how to  retrieve research findings; (3) improving comprehension of research; (4) encouraging regular reading of research; (5) emphasizing preparation for doctoral comprehensive examinations; (6) developing research practica; and (7) developing research teams. Research and the scientific approach can be useful to a broad range of professionals within counseling psychology. If research is perceived as irrelevant, this may reflect on the quality of the research or on ineffective training. Educators must examine the effectiveness of the research training they receive and incorporate into their professional behavior, and be willing to restructure training programs to help students base their practice in and on research.

The research literature indicates that these personal characteristics affect decisions. Furthermore, these characteristics appear to be more salient and to affect decisions in some situations more than in others. Two possible explanations for this phenomenon closely parallel Wernimont and Campbell's (1968) distinction between signs and samples as indicators of job performance. First, personal characteristics may act as a sign to guide a manager's expectations about a worker's level of performance. On the other hand, person constructs may become salient by being either highly consistent or inconsistent with the sample of person  characteristics or situations. The sign approach suggests that researchers should study the supervisor's beliefs about relationships between traits and behaviors, as in Implicit Personality Theory research. The sample approach suggests that the relationship between traits and behaviors is not context-free and the situation and supervisor's perception of the situation should be studied. Both views must be considered in research on the interaction between persons and jobs. Several tables and figures are appended. (Author/ABL)",

This single-subject, reversal design case study examines the etiological variables of a 22-year-old male bulimic patient. Consultation for treatment was made by the patient's parents. Family assessment made in the home provided for observation of the patterns and dynamics of their interaction. It was apparent that marital and family distress contributed to the disorder. Additional evaluation included psychodiagnostic testing, functional analysis of the binge-purge symptoms, and nutritional assessment. Individual and family therapy were valuable in reducing the frequency and duration of binging and purging, yet a pattern of nocturnal binging remained  recalcitrant to change. Assessment of sleeping patterns and daytime substance use revealed a sleep onset and sleep maintenance disturbance. Innovative nutritional treatments were employed, including use of amino acids, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Relaxation training and behavior therapy were also utilized. This combined intervention produced complete remission of symptoms within one month. The family vacation gave opportunity to reverse the intervention when the patient failed to complete his nutritional regimen. The sleeping difficulty and night binging returned. Upon reinstitution of treatment, binges and sleep problems returned to base-line. The patient remained symptom-free at one-year follow-up, suggesting the value of the intervention and proper termination/withdrawal.  (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Although suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents in the United States, there are little empirical data available on psychological factors which may lead an adolescent to consider or attempt suicide. To address this issue, the relationships among depression, social skills, and severity of suicidal attempt were investigated in 30 adolescents who were admitted to a general hospital following a suicide gesture or attempt. Subjects were classified into high (N=16) or low (N=14) risk attempters based on their history of previous attempts, lethality of attempt, and disposition (inpatient versus outpatient treatment). Subjects completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Hopelessness Scale for Children, and the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with  Youngsters. Data analysis revealed no differences between the high risk and the low risk suicide attempters on any of the self-report measures used. Nonetheless, the results suggest that overall levels of psychological distress as reflected by the Hopelessness Scale and the CDI may contribute to suicide attempts since the mean scores obtained in this study were much higher than those reported in studies with normal children and with a mixed group of child psychiatric patients. In addition, the negative relationship between depression and appropriate social skills which is seen in normal populations was not found in this group of adolescent suicide attempters. (NB)",

        "description":"In order for the profession of psychology to guard against racial and ethnic prejudice in the education of future practitioners, it is important to systematically scrutinize training programs to determine if they are biased against minority persons. Such an invesigation was conducted with a sample of graduate students from the California School of Professional Psychology at Berkeley and at Fresno. The quantitative grade point average (GPA), entrance, grade, and dropout data on 74 Berkeley subjects were obtained from school records; comprehensive examination scores were also recorded. The Cross-Cultural Training Experience Questionnaire was completed by 138 Berkeley students, 21 Fresno students, and 11 Berkeley faculty members. Individual interviews were conducted with 20 minority  students. Following a review of the historical factors which influenced the evaluative array of measurements used at this institution, it was predicted that significant differences would be found between minority and nonminority students on pre-admission GPA data; graduate school grades; scores on an objective, multiple-choice comprehensive examination; and incidence of academic failure and withdrawal. While results generally supported these hypotheses, academic differences between groups were often not as great as expected. It was further predicted and confirmed that monocultural bias would be recognized as a serious issue by many students and would be intensely experienced by minority students. These findings suggest that racial and ethnic bias remains a serious problem in the education  of future psychologists. A six-page list of references is included. The appendices consists of: (1) the Student Evaluation Form used at the Berkeley campus; (2) the Cross-Cultural Training Experience Questionnaire; and (3) the interview questions used in this study with minority students at Berkeley.

Implications for practice are addressed. Counselors are cautioned that existing statutes do not represent absolute guarantees, and that there are certain circumstances under which they are always obligated to breach confidentiality. Finally, four  strategies are discussed for counselors desiring to maintain confidentiality when called upon to testify in court: (1) they may explain their code of ethics to the presiding judge and request that privilege be extended to them; (2) if a request for privilege is denied, they may ask that their testimony be heard in camera; (3) they may enter into an attorney-client relationship with the lawyer representing the client's case; and (4) they may testify, or refuse to testify and risk being held in contempt of court.

Youth were from high, middle, and lower income families; 50 percent were runaways and 41 percent were throwaways. Over one-third had been physically or sexually abused by their families and another one-third had been neglected. Status of 11 youth who had been out of the project an average of 5.7 months showed that project youth had statistically significantly better records in achieving employment and stable living situations compared to 18 control group youth receiving other types of  services. Project youth also had school achievements showing a trend in the direction of significance. Pre-post means on measures of self-concept, locus of control, and a personality profile did not show significant change. A concurrent follow-up of the first year youth who had been out of the project an average of 15.9 months revealed that these youth continued to maintain a strong record of success: 81.8 percent were in stable living situations; 81.8 percent were employed; and 90.9 percent were in school or had graduated from high school. The results suggest that the Bridge, Inc. Residential Independent Living Demonstration Project has shown marked success in assisting runaways and homeless youth to achieve employment, stable living situations, and educational progress.

The data in this report came from the final 3 years of the NYS when detailed information about sexual assaults was obtained from all the self-identified victims and offenders. The research project is briefly described, the study results are presented, and implications of the findings for counseling adolescents about the risk and effects of sexual assault are discussed. The frequency of sexual assault among  teenagers and the proportion of teenagers affected are presented, and the typical adolescent assault is described. A section on the aftermath of a sexual assault considers reporting the assault to the police, personal relationships, and personal behavior and reactions. A section on the risk of sexual assault includes a comparison of victims and nonvictims and concludes that the risk is greater for teenagers who engage in delinquent activities with their friends, although teenagers who engage in delinquent activities are not the only victims of sexual assault. The final section, \"Reducing the Risk of Sexual Assault among Teenagers,\" outlines four steps to avoid sexual assault and summarizes advice to teenagers. (NB)",

        "description":"This report on sexual assault was written for adolescents. It contains data on teenage sexual assault from the National Youth Survey (NYS), a survey of a nationally representative sample of approximately 1,700 youths who were between 11 and 17 years old at the time of the project's initial interview and who were interviewed annually for 5 years (1976-1980). The data in this report came from the final 3 years of the NYS when detailed information about sexual assaults was obtained from all the self-identified victims and offenders. The research study is briefly described and then findings from the study are used to answer some of the most common questions teenagers ask about sexual assault: (1) what is sexual assault; (2) who is most likely to be sexually assaulted; (3) who is most  likely to commit a sexual assault; (4) how often does sexual assault happen; (5) how many teenagers are sexually assaulted; (6) is there a typical sexual assault; (7) what causes a sexual assault; (8) what happens after a sexual assault; (9) what can teenagers do to prevent a sexual assault; and (10) what should you do if you are sexually assaulted. Advice for girls and for boys is given on how to prevent a sexual assault. (NB)",

        "description":"Although it has been estimated that over three-fourths of all older adults have living siblings, little information is available on the actual and potential supportive role siblings play for older persons. The sibling relationship has several unique and interesting characteristics and the intimate experiences of childhood may either bind or separate siblings. Siblings usually separate geographically and psychologically as they grow up, yet adults report strong feelings of closeness towards their brothers and sisters. And, although siblings are of little functional importance in terms of providing instrumental services to older adults, sibling relationships are characterized by the desire to help when needed. Sibling support may be instrumental in the individual's facing the  problems of aging. Next to adult children, siblings offer the best prospects for providing older adults with a permanent home. While some studies have indicated that sibilings constitute an important source of social and psychological support in later life, others report that interaction with siblings is not related to the elder's level of morale or feelings of insecurity, loneliness, or usefulness. Although siblings may potentially be a supportive resource in later life, this is not always the case. The level and type of support between older siblings may depend on both the idiosyncracies of the particular sibling relationship and the developmental needs characteristic of older adults. (NB)",

Two types of computer-based systems exist today: guidance systems which help students learn about themselves on-line and information systems which provide search strategies through occupational and educational files. A field study with the systematic career guidance system DISCOVER was conducted in a college placement center in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of computer-assisted guidance within a comprehensive career counseling service of a large university. Students (N=67) with career-related concerns were randomly assigned to one of four groups, each with a different treatment: (1) individual  counseling only; (2) individual counseling and DISCOVER: (3) DISCOVER alone; and ($) no treatment. Subjects completed the survey of Career Development, the Confidence and Progress in Educational/Career Planning Questionnaire, and the Career Development Inventory, and kept a behavior log. These four measures of self-rated progress in educational/vocational planning together yielded 14 scores. The trends of the findings suggest that all three treatments produced positive effects, that DISCOVER alone and individual counseling alone were equivalent in their effects as treatment modalities, and that DISCOVER combined with individual counseling produced the most positive effects.

        "description":"The pros and cons of sexuality education are discussed in this report from Planned Parenthood. Research on the effectiveness of sexuality education has focused primarily on college students, having little relevance for teenage sexuality education. The Kirby report, two studies of the effects of sexuality education on teenagers' attitudes, knowledge, and behavior, found pre- and post-tests were the same for attitude and behavior inventories. Researchers had problems collecting data on teenage pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates which could be linked to the population in the programs. Problems of causal connection between programs and outcomes also arose. Sexuality education did not increase the likelihood that teenagers would have sexual intercourse or that their values would  change as a result of the program. The Kirby report showed that sexuality education did not stop teenagers from having intercourse or having babies, and it concluded that sexuality education needs to be long-term and pervasive to have a positive impact. Community commitment is needed for effective programs. Unless teenagers see the value of postponing childbearing, sexuality education may do little to drop rates of teenage pregnancy. Planned Parenthood, as a provider of quality sexuality education, needs to work with other concerned community groups in complementary activities. Sexuality education, continued and improved access to contraception, and safe legal abortion are three parts of the answer to prevent children from having children. Fifteen references conclude the report.  (ABL)",

        "description":"Evidence in the professional literature that social support in a person's life can lessen the effects of stressful life events makes knowledge of the dynamics of social support and of the workings of the support groups vital for counselors. Social support has been defined by various authors in various ways. Especially helpful to counselors is Gottlieb's (1978) classification of teachable supportive behaviors into the four categories of emotionally sustaining behaviors, problem-solving behaviors, indirect personal influence behaviors, and environmental action behaviors. While most counselors have been trained to work in traditional counseling groups, the support group differs from the counseling group on several dimensions and requires a reorganization of traditional thinking  about group leadership and about the clients' ability to help one another. Counselors can become effective facilitators of support groups by understanding the nature of social support, the dynamics of support groups, and the role of the group facilitator at each stage of group development. The training of a support group facilitator involves three steps: (1) acquiring an academic knowledge base about the operation of support systems and groups; (2) being involved in a support group as an observer and as a group member; and (3) developing a small scale support group. It is hoped that counseling professionals will realize the value of social support inteventions and will both incorporate support groups into their practices and train students to use support groups effectively.

The present study extends these earlier studies by attempting to determine whether individuals who had been clients themselves would perceive differences between a videotape of an empathic counselor and one of a non-empathic counselors. College students (N=34) who had recently received at least three sessions of personal counseling served as subjects in the study. Subjects viewed one videotape of an empathic counselor and one of a non-empathic counselor, on a counterbalanced basis, and rated each on the short version of the Counselor Rating Form. The results  indicated that former clients perceived content-only counseling as highly effective only when a base of empathic communication had been built. The empathic counselor was rated nearly equivalently whether presented first or second. These results emphasize the importance of supportive empathy and the need to teach counselors the skill of empathy. (References and statistical results are included.) (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"While evidence exists that a person's peripheral temperature responds to his state of arousal or stress, it also responds to other environmental factors. Wrist temperature has been found to vary with ambient temperature, and to increase during the school day. Before wrist temperature can be established as a valid measure of anxiety, stress, or arousal, extraneous variables must be identified and their effects minimized. To address this issue, a study was conducted which examined the effect on wrist temperature of ambient temperature, outside air temperature, time of the school day, and grade level differences among students. On 9 days from November to February, 19 sixth graders, 17 seventh graders, and 18 eighth graders strapped on Bio-Temp wrist bands used to measure their wrist  temperatures. Readings were taken at 8:40, 8:50, 9:00, 11:30, and 2:40 during the school day. Careful measurements were also made of ambient and outside temperatures. Analysis of data revealed a systematic increasing trend for mean wrist temperature from the earliest reading to the latest for every grade level. The mean wrist temperatures for all students were &quot;corrected&quot; for the point in the circadian thermal cycle, for shared variation with ambient temperatures, and for the warming of the wrist when coming into the classroom from the outside. A model for explaining wrist temperatures was developed. (NB)",

        "description":"The ability to detect lying is an important skill. While the polygraph is the most common mechanical method used for lie detection, other electronic-based methods have also been developed. One such method, the analysis of voice stress patterns, is based on the assumption that lying is a stressful activity which reduces involuntary frequency modulations in the human voice. One variation of voice analysis involves recording interviews and then transmitting the recordings through the telephone to a second location where the voice is re-recorded, charted, and evaluated. Voice stress analyses were performed on 15 tape-recorded pre-employment interviews in both their original form and after they had been transmitted via telephone and re-recorded. Four expert voice stress examiners,  blind to the telephone condition, reported less stress in the telephone charts than in the original charts. There was little relationship between the stress rating for the same charts in their original and telephone forms. Reliability estimates were low for both the original and telephone stress ratings. Summing over the stress ratings from individual questions and advanced training on the part of the examiners both appeared to improve the reliability estimates. The continued use of telephone recorded tapes as substitutes for the original tapes is highly questionable. In addition, these results suggest that voice analysis ratings, as they are currently used, do not show sufficient reliability to warrant their continued use as a selection procedure for employment.

This study used Fischer's framework to survey state mental health agencies about the status of child and adolescent mental health standards in each state. In the first level, a state-level survey of community mental health directors and children's service coordinators used  an empirical approach to rank factors influencing policy and service systems. At the second level, interviews with stakeholders in the mental health system probed for factors influencing policy. For the third level, the national standards survey provided a glimpse of system-wide behavior on the use of mental health standards. A fourth level values analysis was not undertaken.

This cross-sectional study drew an age-stratified sample of 193 adolescent mothers from two inner-city programs.

Interviews were tape recorded in the home and were scored blind. PA was found to increase with age independently of the effects of social status, vocabulary acquisition, social support, recent negative life changes, or length of parental experience. Older adolescent mothers showed greater flexibility in their thought and a greater capacity for considering complex circumstances when making judgments about child rearing than did younger mothers. These findings support the potential of PA as a developmental dimension to be considered when providing care to young mothers. (Author/ABL)",

During two home visits, PA interviews were conducted and observations made of mother-child interactions. Three methods for recording behavior were used and data were reduced to 27 variables.  Multiple regression analyses allowed controlling potential confounders prior to hypothesis testing. PA proved associated with more of the mother-child interaction variables than any other variable, including socioeconomic status, presence of mate, recent life changes and verbal ability. These findings suggest PA is an important developmental dimension for service programs which could either promote development or accommodate an achieved level of awareness. (Author/ABL)",

In phase 2, an all-female volunteer subsample (N=70) completed an additional questionnaire measuring psychological well-being. The results indicated that the quality of the social environment in bank branches was related to the psychological well-being of employees in the settings. Coworkers' average ratings of the common social environment were  significantly correlated with two indices of individual employees' mental health, depression, and anxiety. Self-esteem was not as strongly related to the quality of the social environment as were depression and anxiety. An enhanced psychological significance to relationships with supervisors compared to relationships with coworkers was demonstrated. Practical applications of this research suggest that clinicians should consider the significant impact of the social environment at work and that organizations should realize the influence supervisors exert on the well-being of employees.

According to this model, these stages are indicated by the relative presence of communicational harmony. To examine the validity of this model, a study was conducted in which therapist topic determination, defined as the proportion of therapist topic initiation responses that were subsequently followed by the client, was used to represent the degree of communicational harmony. It was hypothesized that successful time-limited therapy dyads would demonstrate a high-low-high sequence of therapist topic determination over the course of treatment while unsuccessful  dyads would not. The degree of topic determination over the course of treatment was examined using a replicated N of 1 design for six time-limited psychotherapy dyads, one successful and one unsuccessful dyad from each of the three therapists at a university counseling center. The results indicated that each successful dyad evidenced the general high-low-high pattern of therapist topic determination, but also that there was a fair degree of variation among dyads with respect to the abruptness and speed of moving through the stages. None of the unsucessful dyads were found to have the hypothesized pattern of topic determination. Further research should examine whether this stage model would occur regardless of theoretical approach and whether the same pattern would hold for time-unlimited  dyads. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"School policy which emphasizes the placement of handicapped children in the regular classroom has received acclaim both as a step toward equity and as an attempt to improve the academic learning and social adjustment of handicapped students. Although new teachers entering the system are better prepared than ever before to face the difficulties posed by handicapped students, their skills may be little valued by the old system. Most teachers presently employed have received little training in the competencies needed for effective mainstreaming. Consequently, both new and old educational personnel experience stress with regard to mainstreaming efforts. Three stages of adapting to stress (alarm, resistance, and exhaustion) and three classes of responses to stress (direct action,  cognitive reappraisal, and anxiety) have been identified. The educational system can reduce the stress of mainstreaming by providing increased training, de-emphasizing procedural requirements, facilitating placement and re-placement decisions, and providing information to influence teacher expectations. Teachers themselves can reduce stress by knowing their own standards and limits, analyzing their view of the instrumental role, and establishing a teaching team. In summary, the process of adapting to the stress produced by mainstreaming can be facilitated by effective procedures within the educational system and by the teachers' cognitive reappraisal of their role, the students and their potential, and instructional procedures.

        "description":"It is expected that by 1990 the majority of clerical and managerial workers in North America will use computers in their daily work. An integrative model was developed which views quality of work life as an ever changing dimension influenced by computerization and by perception of career success and non-work factors. To test this model, a study examining various aspects of computerization and their effects upon quality of work life in organizations was conducted. Employers from 10 large firms, 12 medium-sized companies, 3 educational institutions, and 3 government agencies in western Canada selected equal numbers (3-6) of successful managers and support personnel from a variety of departments. Selected employees (N=306) anonymously completed questionnaires designed to assess  respondents' present positions in terms of success, and also their perception of the technology available to them. The results partially support the model in that workers who were accepting computerization positively were more likely to exhibit organizational commitment. In addition, computerization and perception of career success had an impact on the individual's role ambiguity and role conflict in the workplace. Disconfirming findings showed that the additivity theme prevalent in the stress literature was not supported when applied to the computerization process. Future research should investigate the causal relationships between the factors assessed here and such behavioral outcomes as absenteeism and turnover. (NB)",

A study was undertaken to examine acceptance of, and knowledge about, computer-based technology on the part of end-users. Subjects were 277 employees of 15 California-based organizations who used computers for some work tasks. Subjects represented a range of organization departments, job categories, and locations. Subjects anonymously completed questionnaires designed to assess knowledge, use, and availability of computers in their organizations. Questionnaire sections examined background variables, self-concept and  motivation for power and achievement, perceived impact of computers on one's job and future with the company, computer knowledge, computer availability, attitudes toward computers in organizations, and computer usage. The results revealed that job impact was the most important predictor of computer knowledge and acceptance. This finding suggests that with increased perception of job impact, individuals will more likely accept computers and attempt to learn more about computers to secure employment or to retain jobs. Another strong predictor for a person's knowledge about comptuers was actual usage. These results suggest several important considerations not only for research on computer-based technology in organizations, but for human resource management as well.

Managers need to know the most efficient methods available to teach computer skills to their employees in a short time. Such methods need to be suitable for all employees, whether academically gifted or weak. A study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the methods used in teaching computer literacy to business students at a western Canadian university. Subjects were 128 undergraduate management students taking a required micro-computing course designed to make students computer literate. Classroom methods for the course consisted of traditional lectures and computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Students' grades for the  course, grade point averages (GPA), and grades in a BASIC programming course completed by approximately one-half of the subjects were examined. The results revealed that student performance using CAI was predicted by GPA and was affected by completion of the BASIC course. GPA was also found to be a significant predictor of class mark in the micro-computing course. The results suggest that hands-on teaching is superior to traditional classroom lectures, especially for less academically inclined students. Organizations should design training seminars which reflect actual work situations for the benefit or both the end-user and the company. (NB)",

Two major factors identified as contributing to unintended pregnancy are the lack of knowledge and skill in family planning and inconsistency in use of contraceptives. A pretest-posttest experiment was conducted to determine whether nurse-client contracting was useful in counseling single, sexually active youth regarding prevention of pregnancy. Eighteen- to 22-year-old women (N=152) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) routine clinic care only; (2) routine clinic care, education, and contracting; or (3) routine clinic care, education, contracting, and client-selected reinforcers for fulfilling contracts. Subjects completed  questionnaires on knowledge about family planning and reported their reproductive history, frequency of intercourse, contraception, contraceptive use, communication with sex partner about birth control, and demographics. Analyses of data revealed a statistically significant increase in knowledge about human fertility, reproduction, and contraception for both contracting groups but not for the control group. Consistency in use of contraceptives also increased significantly for both contracting groups but not for the control group. Subjects in the contracting-without-reinforcement group had higher attrition rates than subjects in the other groups. These findings suggest that family planning nurse-client contracting, a form of client-centered nursing care, can positively influence the family  planning knowledge and behavior of sexually active young women.

A study was conducted to determine whether nurse-client contracting would be useful as a method for providing nursing care to assist sexually active young women to reduce their risk of having an unintended pregnancy. The pretest-posttest field experiment involved subjects in two contracting groups and one control group. Of subjects involved in contracting, 50 received a client-selected reinforcer for each contract fulfilled and 51 received no reinforcers. The 101 contracting subjects wrote a total of 286 contracts. The family planning nurse-client contracting process included four phases: assessment,  planning, implementation, and evaluation. The results indicated that subjects chose a wide variety of behaviors for their contracts. Both of the contracting groups wrote approximately the same number of contracts. Subjects who received reinforcers fulfilled significantly more of their written contracts than did subjects in the non-reinforcement group. Subjects who did not receive reinforcers were significantly more likely to drop out of the study than those who received reinforcers. Although both forms of contracting resulted in positive gains in subject knowledge and health behavior, these findings indicated that contracting with reinforcement had definite advantages over contracting without reinforcements.

        "description":"Because the science of nursing is still at an early stage of development, nurses involved in clinical research often find that no appropriate measures are available to sample the theoretical construct of interest. Researchers often must design and test new instruments before proceeding to test theory. A study of the effect of nurse-client contracting on family planning knowledge and behaviors in a university student population required the development of a new instrument. For nursing research, it was necessary to obtain pre- and post-test data about the extent of client knowledge about family planning. For clinical nursing assessment, it was essential to make a complete and accurate appraisal of the client's knowledge about family planning. Test items were written and rated by  three expert judges for face validity and for content validity. Item revision resulted in an 86-item instrument on human fertility, reproduction, and contraception. The instrument was field-tested with 38 female university students. While the resulting test-retest reliabilty was adequate, problems arose in examining construct validity. By reducing the instrument to 46 items to meet the requirements for scientific rigor, important client data would be missing from the assessment process. A 76-item compromise instrument was developed which contained the 46 items in a construct on knowledge about family planning. The final instrument was complete, accurate, and appropriate for research. This instrument development represents one situation in which conflicting values emerge as part of the  clinical nursing research process. (NB)",

A substantial amount of the literature in the field portrays the nursing home experience as iatrogenic. A study was undertaken to determine the extent to which one nursing home's residents who were admitted with plans for discharge did not return home and to examine the resons for those patients' derailment. A 160-bed Rhode Island nursing home's case records for 1978-84 were examined. The results revealed that, of 419 residents, 79 were expected to  return to the community. Only 13 of those 79 did not return home. Content analysis of those 13 residents' histories showed that two chose to remain in the nursing home, four had families who declined to fill caregiver roles, and two quickly deteriorated. Even the histories of the five who generally lost the ability to function independently did not suggest that institutional life was to blame. Their initial discharge plans may have been unduly optimistic. This research suggests that nursing home life does not prove iatrogenic for persons admitted with a positive prognosis.

While long-stayers rarely return home, they do not necessarily stay long in one institution. Instead, they may transfer from nursing home to nursing home. Although many studies have examined the impact of relocation on nursing home residents, few studies have analyzed reasons for this nomadism. A study of one nursing home was conducted to analyze reasons for nursing home transfers and to distinguish three types of transfers: (1) voluntary transfers where the resident hopes to improve his quality of life; (2) involuntary transfers where the nursing home seeks to transfer a specific resident; and (3) systemic involuntary transfers due to the nature of the hospital-nursing home discharge nexus.  Social work case histories of 419 residents discharged between 1978 and 1984 from one proprietary Rhode Island nursing home were reviewed to discern the prevalence of inter-nursing home transfers and motivations. Of 98 residents who transferred, 54 did so because they expected to improve their quality of life by transferring. Twenty-five transferred because the nursing home did not want the resident. Many of these residents were considered combative, physically abusive to staff and other residents, or severely disoriented. Sixteen residents transferred because they forfeited their places when they were hospitalized. Data were missing on three transfers. A three-page list of references concludes the document. (NB)",

A sample of unemployed families (N=146) responded to components of the Family Inventory of Life Events which dealt with the stressors present in their family life during a period of unemployment. Data were analyzed according to level of stress, length of unemployment, educational level of head of household, age of respondent, and family income level. The results indicated that there were widely varying sources of stress among the families, some of which could be directly attributed to the status of  unemployment. Family income level and age were significantly correlated to level of stress present. Over one-half of the families reported increased strains to meet costs of food, clothing, and energy and medical/dental expenses. At least 20 percent of respondents reported increased marital conflicts; parent-child conflicts; and increased borrowing, unresolved conflicts, and educational expenses. Less than 10 percent of subjects reported problems of increases in alcohol or drug use, separation or divorce, relocation, legal violations, physical or sexual abuse, runaways, or child problems at school.

A study was conducted to identify the nurturing qualities of parenthood in a sample of 51 presently unmarried, noncustodial fathers, and to determine the importance of these qualities relative to life satisfaction, self satisfaction, and perceptions of the quality of the family environment in the family of origin. Data were obtained using those segments of the Perception of the Parental Role Scales which identify and assess the nurturing qualities of the parental role. In addition, a comparison of single fathers with 119 married fathers and with 125 married mothers from an earlier study on  the same dimensions of nurturing was obtained. The results indicated that these single fathers were highly nurturing and, when compared to both fathers and mothers in dual parent settings, showed greater concern about nurturing aspects of the parental role. These findings contradict the view that noncustodial fathers become less concerned about their children's emotional development. The results suggest that the nurturing traits of parenthood are independent of either marital status or sex of parents. This research has implications for family laws and public policy, child care and custody decisions, and for service providers in various family social programs. (Author/NB)",

The value data for both VPI types and majors were analyzed by separate stepwise discriminant analysis procedures. Two significant canonical discriminant functions occurred for work values by type. The direction and ordination on function 1 indicated that the Artistic type valued Esthetics highly, while placing little importance on Security and Supervisory Relations. Function 2,  which included Altruism and Achievement, showed the greatest separation between the Social type and the other types. Three significant canonical discriminant functions occurred for work values by major. Function 1 showed that Artistic majors highly valued Esthetics, Creativity, Independence, and Surroundings. Function 2 showed Social majors placing high importance on Altruism as compared to the other groups. Function 3 indicated an emphasis on Economic Return, Management, and Security for the Enterprising majors of business administration and political science.

Although no studies have specifically examined the relationship between adolescent loneliness and attributional style, research has found that children's attributions do affect interpersonal behaviors. The relationship between adolescent loneliness and perceptions of controllabiltiy and stability was studied in 99 male and 73 female ninth grade students. The students were tested as a group within their English classes. The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale was used to assess the students' levels of loneliness. The Adolescent Attribution Assessment Scale, designed for this study, was used to assess the students' attributional styles in terms of controllability and stability. Completion of these scales took  approximately 75 minutes and required two class periods to finish. Data were analyzed by computing Pearson correlation coefficients. The results revealed a significant overall relationship between an individual's loneliness and his perceptions of controllabilty and stability with higher loneliness scores being related to perceptions of uncontrollability and stability. An important sex difference was also found. For males, loneliness was related to perceptions of uncontrollability but was not related to perceptions of stability. The data for females suggest a trend toward loneliness being related to perceptions of stability but not to perceptions of controllability. (NB)",

        "description":"Research has shown that relaxation exercises produce physical changes in students. After relaxation exercises, students appear calmer, have reduced levels of anxiety, and are more responsive to instruction. In order to determine if relaxation exercises would improve the rate at which students learn keyboarding, a study was conducted in a South Carolina high school computer laboratory. Volunteer students (N=27) from three high schools completed the project. Subjects were divided into three groups which participated in ten 1-hour keyboarding lessons after school using a computerized instructional delivery system: (1) a control group which had 15 minutes of classroom discussion but no relaxation exercises; (2) a short treatment group which received 10 minutes of relaxation exercises  prior to each keyboarding lesson; and (3) a long treatment group which received 20 minutes of relaxation exercises. Students wore finger temperature indicators, took eight tests of keyboarding achievement, and completed a Questionnaire for Keyboarding Instruction at the end of the study. Treatment groups also completed a Questionnaire for Relaxation Training. The results revealed that the relaxation exercises raised finger temperature, indicating the elicitation of the relaxation response. Although the temperatures in the experimental groups increased more than those in the control group, there were no significant differences between temperatures of students in the two experimental groups. Similarly, the two treatment groups significantly outperformed the control group in keyboarding  achievement but did not differ significantly from each other, suggesting that 10 minutes is sufficient time to produce a measurable change in the relaxation state. ( A five-page list of references, questionnaires, and examples of relaxation exercises are appended.) (NB)",

        "description":"Homelessness is a significant social problem in the United States and it has been estimated that there may be as many as 2.5 million homeless people in this country today. For these people, poverty, substance abuse, and harsh living conditions may further contribute to the development of physical and mental health problems. A study was conducted to evaluate the mental and physical health needs of the homeless, with future goals of using the results in policy development by state agencies. Residents (N=75) of four temporary shelters in a large urban area were given a non-intrusive physical exam by a nurse. Nurses also gathered information on health-related behaviors, self-reported problems, and psychiatric hospitalization history. A social worker administered a self-report  psychological symptom scale and gathered background and demographic information. The results indicated that the homeless, while a very heterogeneous population, suffered from significant health problems which were compounded by a limited access to adequate and affordable health care. Many reported significant histories of psychiatric problems or current psychological distress. Mental and physical health problems may be exacerbated by alcohol or drug dependencies, environmental stresses, and victimization by criminals. These findings suggest the prevalence of a wide range of health problems among this homeless group. It is likely that the hard-core homeless, who live on the street and do not use shelters, experience even more extensive health problems. (NB)",

While criminal activity may become a means for the homeless to obtain resources needed for basic survival, little is known about the level of criminal activity among the homeless or about the types of crimnal activity in which the homeless engage. Although there are many ways in which the criminal behavior of the homeless may be assessed, each has its own methodological problems. Existing research indicates that substantial numbers of the homeless have a history of involvement in the criminal justice system and that the homeless may be overrepresented among certain identified criminal groups. A study was conducted to gather information through  self-report and from archival data on a sample of 125 homeless shelter users concerning both their criminal history and their current illegal activity. Interview data were gathered on prior arrests, incarceration history, illegal drug use, and current illegal sources of support. The results revealed a wide range of past and current criminal behavior: as many as 62.4% of the subjects had been arrested for illegal behavior, or admitted to earning current illegal income, and 44.3% of male respondents had a history of incarceration in jail or prison. Criminal behavior appeared to serve various functions among the homeless, and the homeless who engaged in illegal behavior can be classified as chronic criminals, supplemental criminals, criminals out of necessity, substance abusers, or the  mentally ill. While the homeless as a whole engage in relatively high levels of illegal activity, for many this is an adaptive response to dealing with severely limited resources. (NB)",

Research has indicated that most of the homeless are single and have no family relationships or friends to provide support. A study was conducted to gather information on both objective and subjective measures of social support from 125 individuals residing at a temporary shelter in a large midwestern city. Objective measures included marital status, church attendance, the number of good friends and the frequency of contact with them, and the presence of relatives and the frequency of contact with them. Subjective measures of social support were made to assess how the respondents felt about the quantity and quality of support received. While the results are generally supportive of the contention  that the homeless lack social supports, they also suggest that many respondents had significant resources available to them for social support. In particular, participants were able to identify family members as providers of social support. Shelter users can be assumed to be willing to accept certain types of social support, simply by virtue of the fact that they are accepting shelter services. The homeless who remain on the street may be more likely to rely on alternatives which do not involve social interactions. Future research should examine social support among this more difficult street population. (NB)",

In addition, work values in both Japan and the United States appear to be changing. More information is needed on the work values of American and Japanese female workers. A study was conducted to explore the work ethics of Japanese women and to compare them to those of American women. Subjects were 261 Japanese and 347 American employed women who were tourists in Hawaii. Subjects completed the Work Ethics questionnaire, an instrument designed to reflect the traditional values of both Japanese and American cultures. The questionnaire was translated into Japanese for Japanese subjects. T-tests used to test for significance of differences revealed that the Japanese and American  women differed significantly on 27 of 37 work ethics. In comparison with American women, Japanese women were more prone to value group participation; to work in large rather than small companies; to value loyalty to employer and country; to desire more time for leisure and recreational activiites; and to believe that suffering adds meaning to life and that money acquired easily is usually spend unwisely. American women were more prone to value individualism, independence, self-expression and personal growth; and to believe that individual freedom is more important than group solidarity, that hard work pays off in success, that many people dislike work and try to avoid it, and that most people have too much leisure.

Among the variables examined were practice, novelty or familiarity of a word or word category, the speed and efficiency with which persons acquire automaticity, reaction time, and number of tasks performed concurrently. Subjects, 30 sixth and seventh grade students at the university school at the University of Wyoming, were randomly assigned to order of treatment. Each student participated in three 30-minute sessions. Session one included instructions, two 20-task decoding practice trials, instructions, and two 30-task decoding trials with reaction times recorded. Sessions two and three began with review instructions followed by three 30-task trials. Students were allowed ten minutes of game  time with a computer game disk following the second and third sessions to add attractiveness to the otherwise monotonous decoding activity. The first task was a visual task, the second an aural task, and the third task was a dual-task involving both visual and aural modes. Single task reaction times were briefer than under dual task conditions, reaction time was reduced from trials one through eight and subjects responded to familiar words more rapidly than to unfamiliar words. Reading level, number of tasks, familiarity of stimuli and practice accounted for approximately 42% of the variance in reaction time for the aural task. (HTH)",

        "description":"One segment of a larger study (which explores whether secondary teachers and their students alter their discussant roles after being made aware of their classroom interaction) examined the extent to which reading the textbook is necessary for engaging in discussion. Three English teachers and their classes were selected as participants. The teacher with low reading ability students received supervisory intervention, which consisted of a preobservation conference, videotaped observation of 12 postreading discussions, a stimulated recall session while both watched the videotape of the lesson, and a postlesson conference. The other two teachers and their classes served as controls. Observations made during taping, interviews, questionnaires, content analysis of textbooks, and the  students' written work provided data which showed (1) that the intervention did not alter teacher-student roles or patterns of verbal interaction, and (2) that a move away from literal-level discussion resulted in a decreased reliance on the textbook for participation in discussions. The study raises questions about discussion as a language art, a focus for research, and a classroom activity about which teachers' expectations may vary depending on their students' reading abilities.

To confirm the validity of these variables in the reading process, to test reading models employing them in an integrated and interactive manner, and to identify developmental changes in the models, a study was undertaken involving 77 third grade and 65 fifth grade students. The students read orally a social studies passage and identified within-sentence breaks in the passage. After a buffer task, they were asked to retell all they could remember from the passage, then completed a multiple choice comprehension measure and a standardized reading achievement test. A model using the variables was then  hypothesized, fitted to the study data, and tested using structural equation modeling. The findings suggest that the variables are valid surface level factors involved in fluent reading, that they interact in leading to comprehension, and that the nature of their interrelationship was not static, since developmental changes occurred.

Other issues to consider might include: (1) how much emphasis should be placed upon the use of structural analysis, context clues, syllabication, configuration clues,  and picture clues by learners in identifying new words; (2) how much direct instruction should be given to develop depth in comprehension skills; and (3) how student purpose in reading might be encouraged without undue emphasis being placed upon the concept of analysis.

Thirty-nine average and superior comprehenders were tested on their ability to detect inconsistencies contained in short essays prior to, immediately after, and one week after participation in one of three instructional groups: a teacher-directed didactic control group, a neutral self-instruction group, and a specific self-instruction group. Children in the didactic control group received the same instructional content as children in the neutral self-instruction group, but without active rehearsal. In addition to the active rehearsal components, the specific self-instruction group received self-statements specifying an optimal task  criterion. Within each ability level, planned contrasts were made among students' immediate and delayed performances across the three instructional groups. Immediately after training, the average comprehenders displayed equivalent improvement across all groups while the superior comprehenders in the specific self-instruction group improved significantly more in detecting errors than did the didactic control group. One week later, no improvement differences were noted between the groups for either ability level. Superior comprehenders displayed significantly greater improvements than the average comprehenders only immediately after receiving the specific self-instruction. Although the superior comprehenders detected more text errors than the average comprehenders, the patterns of  improvement following instruction were similar in all the remaining between-ability comparisons.

ACT test scores of 2,431 students were used to predict Form C Nelson-Denny raw scores. ACT test scores from 3,016 students were used to predict the Form E Nelson-Denny raw scores. To achieve clarity and accuracy of prediction, separate analyses were conducted for each form of the Nelson-Denny Test. The results indicated that reading skill, as measured by the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, can be estimated with a moderate degree of accuracy by using the ACT Social Studies Reading and ACT English Usage subtests. In addition, the established statistical  relationship between the Nelson-Denny and ACT tests suggests that if the ACT tests are used initially for college placement or course predictions, it is doubtful that the addition of Nelson-Denny test data would result in substantive improvement in the prediction.

Chapter 1 teachers and assistants provided 45-50 minutes each day of supplementary  reading instruction to groups of five to eight students, worked closely with classroom teachers, and made telephone, personal, and written contact with parents. The national reading achievement objective (a gain, on the average, of seven normal curve equivalents (NCE) between pretest and posttest) was met in grades one through six. The local goals of parent involvement and inservice training were achieved; however the goals regarding student attitude toward self and school were not met. It was recommended that additional efforts be made toward improving student attitudes and increasing parent involvement. (LLZ)",

        "description":"A series of four experiments explored a discrepancy in the findings of research regarding the use of the keyword method for learning vocabulary, specifically whether the presentation method (paced vs. unpaced) or the treatment administration (subjects in groups vs. subjects as individuals) determines its effectiveness. Two experiments involved individual college undergraduates whose task was to learn Spanish vocabulary items, while the other two experiments involved small groups of high school students who were to learn lists of low-frequency English nouns. In each of the four experiments, there were two experimenter-paced groups--one instructed to use the keyword method and the other provided with no specific strategy--and two subject-paced groups, also using either the keyword  or no specific strategy. The results of these experiments are as follows: (1) under the subjects-as-individuals condition, reliable keyword effects were detected for both paced and unpaced subjects; and (2) under the subjects-in-groups condition, the recall of keyword users was reliably lower than that of the control subjects regardless of presentation method. These results suggest that it is the method-of-treatment administration (individual vs. group) rather than the method-of-item presentation (paced vs. unpaced) that is the reason for the failure of previous research to obtain positive keyword effects. They also suggest a need for investigators to redirect their efforts from studying pacing-interaction limitations to finding a solution to the group-administration difficulties apparent  in the earlier research.

        "description":"A two-part study examined the effectiveness of glossing (writing comments or questions in text to improve comprehension) when students use it in social studies texts in combination with discussions and other activities. Students were divided into two groups, one of which learned glossing while the other engaged in assigned workbook activities. Results indicate that specifications for glossing can be developed and can be helpful if someone such as a reading specialist assists the teacher in applying them to content area materials. Glossing seems to be particularly helpful to teachers who want to be closely involved with guiding and directing student learning. Results also indicate that students need to be trained in the use of gloss techniques in order to ensure their successful  application. However, while gloss seems to help students with the short-term retention of important ideas, it does not seem to aid their learning of more global concepts. (LLZ)",

        "description":"In an effort to validate dynamic assessment methods influenced by Vygotsky's (1978) definition of zones of proximal development (an indicator of readiness), three sets of experiments addressed two goals: the development of diagnostic assessment methods and the use of diagnostic results to guide the design of instructional programs. The first two studies examined two psychological processes presumed to be significant predictors of academic performance: acquiring new information (learning) and using that information in novel situations (transfer). Results indicated the validity of the methods used, showing (1) that groups of children of contrasting abilities do differ in terms of learning and transfer, with differences being greater in transfer; and (2) that learning and transfer  are better predictors of performance than either IQ or standardized test scores, with the best predictor being transfer. In the third study, which tested the instructional application of dynamic assessment results (emphasizing enhancing the transfer process), subjects taught to use four reading strategies demonstrated gains in their ability to transfer these skills, as evidenced by their standardized and reading comprehension test scores. Results of these studies suggest that the best predictors of the extent to which individuals are likely to profit from instruction are their initial response to instruction (learning) and, even more, how successfully they can transfer their learning to novel situations. Results also suggest the superiority of dynamic assessment over static testing for  planning for instruction. A seven-page list of references is included. (LLZ)",

Having written a logical &quot;hypothesis story&quot; of their own, students then read the assigned material and confirmed, modified, or disconfirmed their predictions. Results indicated that story impressions had a significantly facilitative effect on story comprehension. Story-impressions may be introduced as a whole class activity in which the teacher writes an &quot;hypothesis story&quot; generated by the class on the blackboard. After reading the story, the class discusses the predictions as a group.  The teacher should stress that it is important to make only logical and creative guesses, not to match the author. A number of steps can guide teachers when developing a set of story-impressions, including using words directly from the story and arranging the impressions vertically, indicating their chronological order. Story-impressions may also be used as a retrieval device when giving an oral report, as a writing activity, as a notetaking technique, as guides for students writing summaries of stories, and as aids for students developing sequencing skills. (Examples of story-impressions and hypothesis-stories are included.) (LLZ)",

The five texts discussed are (1) \"Reading Strategies for Middle and Secondary School Teachers,\" by Burmeister; (2) \"Reading Instruction through Content Teaching,\" by Cheek and Cheek; (3) \"Reading Improvement in the Secondary School,\" by Dechant; (4) \"Reading and Learning from Text,\" by Singer and Donlan, and (5) \"Content Area Reading,\" by Vacca. The first section of the  paper discusses the definitions of critical thinking and reading given by each of the authors. The second section deals with the strategies for teaching reading comprehension offered by each text, observing that, in general, critical reading is taught as a subskill of comprehension with appropriate exercises to strengthen the component parts of critical reading. The third part analyzes the texts' content, noting that all writers include critical reading as an aspect of comprehension, agreeing with Vacca that reading is a thoughtful, cognitive process.

However, recent observations of kindergarten teachers reading to their students suggest that these recommendations do not say enough to teachers and teacher educators about the &quot;how&quot; of storybook reading. Observations and transcripts of two kindergarten teachers reading aloud the same book were analyzed in light of the eight recommendations for  effective storybook reading. The results did not distinguish between the two teachers. A deeper analysis of the teacher talk, however, indicated differences as well as similarities between the two readings. The amount of talk by teacher B was greater than that of teacher M overall, as well as before and during the reading, but not in the discussion after the reading. Teacher B focused much more upon asking inferential questions than did teacher M, who focused twice on the episode which contained the theme of the story, while teacher B's focus was broader, giving attention to many aspects of the story. While teacher M's talk concentrated mainly on the moral of the story, teacher B can better be characterized as focusing on thinking skills. (HTH)",

They were asked to express specific semantic relationships (sequence/cotemporality, intention/instrument, and intention/enablement) between the actions in two contrasting versions of this cartoon. Prior to or during the writing task, students received instructional materials in one of four training conditions, or a nonverbal concept attainment task that served as the control. The measures of precision on the writing task were (1) production time (how long it took the writers to produce the description); (2) score (how well the writers expressed the semantic relationships); (3) satisfaction (how satisfied the  writers were with their performance on the three relationships once the task was completed); and (4) estimate (how accurately the writers estimated their performance). Results showed that on no measure of time, performance, satisfaction, or ability of estimate performance, did the training conditions significantly alter the student's ability to write with precision. In contrast, the domain (the set of characters, actions, and activities) and the interaction of domain and version of the cartoon had repeatedly marked effects on student performance and ability to estimate performance.

Three college classes were observed for one semester. Data were collected in the form of field notes, cassette tapes of classes, interviews with instructors and volunteer students, and a compilation of student and instructor writing, handouts, and sample text assignments. Interviews revealed participants' perceptions of and expectations for the course and the teaching/learning process. Interview data were compared with transcripts and other collected data for consistency between espoused theories and observed behaviors. Analysis of the data revealed that, as  in elementary and secondary classrooms, instructor talk usually dominated. Instructors usually originated and controlled the patterns of talk and the meanings exchanged. Two levels of meaning, related to content and process, were communicated directly or indirectly in all three courses. Students had to discover those instructor meanings and commit themselves to performing or producing what was expected in order to succeed in the course. Although some evidence of a constructive model of interaction and learning appeared in the interview and transcript data, all three courses' patterns of interaction and linguistic profiles favored a transmissive model.

Subjects, two males and four females ranging in age from 19 to 40, were tested using a modified \"Symbol Language Battery,\" an instrument designed by neurologist Warren Weinberg to test modal writing of normally intelligent subjects with developmental disorders. The instrument required each subject to write a short paragraph of three to seven sentences in each of four modes of writing: narration, description, classification, and comparison/contrast. Subjects were given an overview of the modes as rhetorical strategies  and asked to write in the modes in ascending order of difficulty in four hour-long sessions. Subjects' learning disability evaluations were also compared with a Xenon Blood Flow Study to verify the location of their deficiency and to design task-specific exercises. Subjects were then retested and reevaluated. Preliminary results indicated that Xenon pictures of subjects' brains were suggestive of subjects' surface writing problems. Improvement in the second writing samples indicated that exercises addressing particular deficiencies altered writing behavior in some subjects. (HOD)",

        "author":["Baiocco, Sharon A."],
        "description":"A study examined the composing processes of eight college freshman writers and the contexts for their writing when they composed in natural settings without narrow time constraints. Subjects, both traditional freshmen and adult learners with varying degrees of writing skill, were assigned two research tasks during which they kept tape-recordings and logs of their composing sessions and processes, as well as all their written products. The first task was a carefully subdivided persuasive writing assignment, while the second task was a \"free choice\" assignment for which students had to invent the writing problem as well as its solution. The results indicated that students varied considerably in the frequency of their composing sessions, and that time was the single most important  external factor affecting students' composing processes. The recursive nature of the composing process was supported by the results. Most subjects were capable of successfully drafting short papers without having any written plan for their drafts, suggesting that traditional \"outlining \" methods are simply not necessary. The persuasive task elicited more varied process strategies for generating ideas, engaging students in use of analogy, conditional argumentation, hypothetical scripts, and other imaginative strategies. Students generated more ideas at all levels for the problem paper, and also more written plans; despite this, however, final drafts of these papers were an average of six sentences shorter, suggesting that translating ideas into words was harder for the persuasive task. The  results have implications for teachers that involve the need to set up supportive writing environments and to establish instructional objectives and make assignments that draw on students' own experience. Implications for the direction of writing research in the areas of composing contexts, composing processes, and task variables are also discussed. (HTH)",

        "description":"A study focusing on the history of reading, or the uses of literacy, in the first years of the American republic examined the subscription list and content of &quot;The New York Magazine; or, Literary Repository&quot; for 1790. Data for the study were taken from the magazine's subscription list and from various biographical sources, such as the New York city directories. Contents of the magazine during its first year of publication were also analyzed. Although &quot;The New York Magazine's&quot; content would at first seem to be evidence of a rather elite audience, the subscriber list shows a varied readership. About half of the readers were artisans and shopkeepers. Considered together, the subscriber list and the content of the magazine offer insight into the social function of reading in that  era. Magazine reading was closely associated with the values of artisan republicanism. The magazine can be viewed as an arena of popular participation in a formerly elite culture of science and education, arts and letters, virtue and honor, and cultivation and character. Although the content of the magazine was eclectic and seems elitist, its readers were not. The leadership at the time was Republican and &quot;The New York Magazine&quot; was republican literature.

The Dutch Parliament addressed this problem in 1984, 1985, and 1986 as it approved steps to implement the &quot;Medianota,&quot; the comprehensive policy document on the media, and took subsequent steps to enforce it. The document provides protection for Dutch culture, the Dutch press, and the Dutch broadcasting industry. Among the goals accomplished by the Dutch policy are (1) avoiding cultural fragmentation by restricting non-Dutch advertising, non-Dutch satellite programming, and protection of television and film production; (2) meeting the needs of political minorities without alienating the  majority of the country's population; seeking popular programming by advocating a third channel and expanding hours of the two existing channels; and requiring public affairs programming of the broadcast organizations to which the Dutch government allocates air time. While the media bill may not be considered model legislation by other countries because of the unique structure of Dutch broadcasting, it does contain the necessary policy elements for successful balance among vested interests, national cultural, and new technology. Notes, and a five-page list of references concludes the report. (DF)",

The result was a government-business partnership bill that became known as the National Industrial Recovery Act. Because it had the assistance of a huge public relations push, the bill almost succeeded. Eventually, owners of small businesses protested, and their objections were publicized by sympathetic journalists and legislators. Finally, the Supreme Court declared the National Recovery Act unconstitutional. Recently, some public relations-minded  corporate leaders have been pushing for greater business involvement in politics. Although executives have the right to suggest intensification of strategic public relations, they should also remember that past involvement in politics was not successful for some companies. (DF)",

        "author":["Sipple, Jo-Ann M."],
        "description":"The anchor of successful writing-across-the-curriculum programs is an organized nucleus of features called the four Ps: planning, proposing, preparing, and prototyping. Planning requires organization and connections among the mechanisms of designing and implementing both program activities and evaluation designs. It should begin at least two years before the program begins and then continue throughout the life of the program. Planning also requires evaluation designs that are internal as well as external, formative as well as summative. Proposing, like planning, is recursive because, after the initial proposal is submitted to internal and external sources of funding, the institution finds itself proposing still more ways to extend, expand, or continue what was begun. Preparing  requires orienting all people at the institution for the program before, during, and after implementation. The nature of the preparation for faculty is largely dependent on the project administration's ability to look to and beyond English faculty in making writing across the curriculum happen. The final cycle, prototyping, sets a program apart from others. It is what constitutes model programs and insures their long-term maintenance. There are representative prototypes of parts if not of whole programs that have influenced program development elsewhere. If any aspect of writing across the curriculum is replicable, the value of such a program has far-reaching effects beyond the interest of its home institution. (HOD)",

Second, characteristics of effective helpers must be identified, including helper empathy, helper warmth and caring, and helper regard and respect, as well openness and honesty. The helping process can be divided into six stages: (1) preparing and beginning, (2) clarifying, (3) structuring, (4) exploring (5) consolidating, and (6) planning and terminating. Finally, counselors must develop skills for listening and understanding, such as paraphrasing,  perception checking, direct and indirect leading, interpreting, and summarizing.

The data came from a random sample of 268 San Francisco area residents interviewed over the telephone about their attitudes toward mass media, news, and public opinion. Respondents were sorted into categories for low, moderate, or high extremity of attitude based on their responses to a Likert scale. As a result of this sorting scheme, the extremity of attitude measure was issue-specific  but direction-free. The results supported the curvilinear relationship hypothesized, especially in the case of newspaper coverage of issues. The relationship appeared marginally significant for television. Political liberals demonstrated the curvilinear pattern, but conservatives' trust ratings declined steadily as their partisanship increased. (Charts illustrating the text are appended.) (HOD)",

Four separate versions of a news article and its headline were prepared by the researcher. Subjects, 40 students from an undergraduate biology course at New Mexico State University, were randomly divided into four groups. Each group was then given one of four versions of a news article and headline prepared by the researcher. Each member of the group read the article and completed a questionnaire. The results indicated that a headline that identifies someone and falsely defames that person could cause more damage than  a libelous article. These results suggest that courts should be aware of the fact that a medium-sized headline can significantly damage a reputation, regardless of what the article states. Therefore, the current trend of examining the accompanying article to such a headline in order to determine libel must be reevaluated. (DF)",

        "description":"With the advent of the process approach to teaching writing, the use of products or models in the composition classroom has declined, replaced by heuristic exploration of the rhetorical situation, with special emphasis on audience analysis. Some researchers have emphasized the difference between internal audiences and audiences external to the text, while other theorists have focused on the relationship between internal audiences and specific genres. Internal readerships are common in business and technical writing, as well as academic writing--persuasive discourse as well as literary discourse. Internal readers of various types have been the focus of entire schools of literary criticism, especially reader-response critics. For example, in his book on the validity of  interpretation, E.D. Hirsch ties interpretation to reader expectations that arise from the interpreter's conception of the &quot;type of meaning&quot; being presented in the text. Not so well studied are the readerships inherent to academic discourse, although their presence seems to be assumed by most theorists. Technical and business writing target readerships through structural conventions. Even persuasion encodes its own image of reader, reflecting the cultural percepts of the time. The prevalence of model readers within genres suggests that models as examples of generic types can be introduced into the writing classroom without sacrificing attention to rhetorical concerns, such as audience.

It was hypothesized that themes relating to autonomy would appear more often in men's essays, while women would write more frequently about their connectedness to others. Two hundred essays, one on each of two topics and written by 50 men and 50 women selected from a university writing proficiency test, were examined by male/female pairs of raters. The first topic asked students to identify an unreasonable demand that had been made of them, while the second required students to identify a decision they regretted making.  Surprisingly, the results indicated a greater number of autonomous responses for both topics. The demand topic produced 72 autonomous and 25 connected responses. The autonomous responses occurred in precisely equal proportions for each sex. Of the 25 connected responses, 14 were written by women, 11 by men. The decision topic produced 64 autonomous responses, 36 written by men and 28 by women. Of the connected responses to this topic, 22 were written by women and 14 by men. Although women produced fewer connected than autonomous responses, and although some of the connected responses were produced by men, the overall pattern within sex was for men to produce the autonomous responses and for women to account for most of the connected responses.

        "description":"Prompted by a report of the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE), which noted a correlation between regional minority population and newsroom employment, a study investigated the hiring patterns of 24 small and medium-sized California dailies. California was chosen because it has one of the highest non-white populations in the nation (about 25% of the state's 26 million). Newspaper editors, publishers, and personnel officers were asked about the number and percentages of non-whites working in professional news gathering, editing, or management positions. The data indicated the percentage of non-whites holding professional positions on medium-sized and small dailies in California is considerably higher than the national average of 5.6 %. For six of the medium-sized papers,  the percentage was 12%. However, for 18 small newspapers, the percentage was 4.9%. For both groups, the average was 8.4%. For metropolitan dailies in the state, the figure was 12.7%. The statewide average, including small, medium, and metropolitan dailies, was 9.8%, still higher than the national figure.

Subjects completed a 39-statement instrument on which they indicated levels of agreement or disagreement on the following concerns: control and disruption, role of student newspapers, censorship, responsibilities of advisers, role of administrators, controversial issues, and freedom of expression in general. Usable responses were received from 191 school newspaper advisers and 144 high school principals. Among the findings were the following: (1) 58.8% of the principals, but only 22.5% of the advisers, agreed that school administrators should have the right to prohibit publication of  articles they think harmful, even though such articles might not be libelous, obscene, or disruptive; (2) 58.5% of the principals agreed that maintaining discipline in the school is more important than publishing a newspaper free from administrative censorship, while 74% of the advisers disagreed; (3) 96.5% of the principals and 89% of the advisers agreed that student newspaper advisers should review all copy before it is printed; and (4) 46.5% of the principals disagreed that the student newspaper should be allowed to print a story it can prove is true even if printing the story will hurt the school's reputation, while 44.5% of the advisers agreed that such an article should be published.

        "description":"Instructional communication research may be examined from the perspective of teacher effectiveness research, based on three dominant 20th-century philosophical traditions: logical empiricism, interpretive theories, and critical theory. Since at least 1896, scholars have used empirical research methodology (largely \"logical empiricism,\" modeled after the approach of the natural sciences) to shed light on what it means to be an effective teacher. Approaches have ranged from naturalistic descriptions of teacher classroom behaviors to tightly controlled experiments that manipulate such variables as teacher clarity in order to assess their impact on student learning, and have included examining teacher evaluation rating scales and studying the cognitive processes that mediate  instructional stimuli and learning outcomes. As a result of the criticisms against logical empiricism, other researchers are beginning to use interpretive inquiry, that is, observing and analyzing human behavior in natural settings to discover what and how people learn through interacting with others. Finally, the critical inquiry approach takes into account historical-ideological movements. Despite this diversity of approaches, however, the vast majority of instructional communication research has been conducted from within the trait-rating tradition of empirical inquiry. While success in these efforts is important, the usefulness of instructional communication research is likely to be enhanced by encouraging the use of other research methodologies. (HOD)",

        "description":"The interpersonal communication course at an Ohio college is based on several assumptions about the nature of interpersonal communication. First, the course should emphasize both the ability to demonstrate knowledge of the communicative behavior appropriate in a given situation (cognitive domain) and the performance necessary for communication (skill domain). Second, interpersonal communication is complex and situational. Each member of a given interaction brings a heavy load of baggage, including old and new attitudes, values, and past experiences. Since the situation, organization, and culture also add to the complexity of interpersonal interchange, an interpersonal course should assist students in understanding that complexity. Third, research on cognitive development suggests  that understanding the situational nature of interpersonal communication and determining the best communication strategy are probably beyond the maturation level of most freshmen and sophomores. As a result, the interpersonal course is best offered as an upper level course that provides an excellent vehicle for introducing social science methodology to upperclass students who are capable of critically evaluating the literature and conducting field studies. Although teaching a central element such as interpersonal communication to upperclass students may be questioned by many, it is too important to be diluted for the entering student.

In addition, the chairpersons answered demographic questions and completed a satisfaction scale. Results showed that the subjects  perceived their management styles as flowing from a theory Z culture. However, on two issues--tenure/promotion and &quot;quality control of product&quot;--the subjects operated from theory X. Other findings were that the subjects were reasonably satisfied.

Specifically, it sought to identify the communicative forms that create shared consciousness, to describe shared fantasies, to illustrate the role of group fantasy in forming rhetorical visions, and to demonstrate how fantasy themes and ritualistic behaviors support the symbolic value of the bargaining rite. Two researchers observed approximately 40 hours of negotiation sessions between six members of an administrative team and six members of a teachers' team from a large, unionized, suburban school district. Four approaches of observation were used: (1) observations and detailed field notes, (2) interviews, (3) survey questionnaires,  and (4) document analysis. Analysis of the data provided interesting conclusions about the rhetorical vision of collective bargaining in the district. The negotiation deviated from the model being tested, in that the ritualistic behaviors in the negotiation did not parallel the model's view of bargaining as a rite of conflict reduction. Instead, the negotiations reinforced the current authority system and communicated that traditions are sacred. The results suggested that further research is needed to determine how and why fantasy themes and rhetorical visions evolve for bargaining participants. A three-page bibliography is included. (DF)",

In addition, the study investigated the relationships among students' CA, their perceptions of nonverbal immediacy (the degree of perceived physical or psychological closeness between communicators) in general and specific contexts, and their final course grades. Subjects, 389 students in a basic communication skills course, completed  measures of CA and nonverbal immediacy. Results showed that high apprehensive students did not receive lower final course grades than did moderate or low apprehensive students. Further, final grades were not affected by students' perceptions of either general or contextual immediacy. Communication apprehension, overall and in generalized contexts, was significantly correlated with generalized and contextual immediacy. As expected, when CA increased, immediacy became lower. (FL)",

The study involved establishing teachers' conceptual levels by having the subjects complete paragraphs on given topics (the Paragraph Completion Method). The paragraphs were analyzed to determine the degree of differentiation the subjects made among the concepts involved and the degee to which those concepts were integrated. The teachers also completed questionnaires and submitted to interviews concerning their use of supervisory services and  participation in professional development activities. The study failed to find significant relationships between teachers' conceptual levels and (1) the frequency of their requests for direct assistance services, (2) the variety of direct assistance services sought, (3) the specific services sought, (4) the location of resources sought for instructional improvement, (5) the use of a variety of resources from a variety of locations, and (6) the teachers perceptions of the availability of assistance. Conceptual level was related to the number of informal professional development activities in which teachers engaged. (PGD)",

The first of the OSP Model's three phases covers assessment of a district's level of sex equity and degree of compliance with Title IX; the second phase focuses on development of a long-range plan to address any areas of noncompliance found; and the third phase monitors the implementation of the planned remediation efforts. The first phase involves review of district documents, observations in classrooms and other school spaces, and interviews with selected staff members and students. In the second phase, a random sample of staff members and  students is surveyed, major and minor areas of noncompliance are identified, planning processes are established, and the plan itself is developed and scheduled. In the third phase, representatives of the Office of Sex Equity consult with district officials to see that the plan is carried out as intended. Charts of the three phases explain the relationships among the agencies involved in the process and identify associated costs. (PGD)",

The project's two major objectives were to study improvement processes in schools and to study the organization, roles, and functions of, and interrelationships among, agencies that support school improvement. The project conducted five separate studies, created two tools to support school improvement efforts, and generated several publications and reports. This report begins with a brief overview of the project's goals, objectives, and audiences, then describes the five major studies in terms of their purposes, design, problem areas, findings, and products. The five studies are the Local School Improvement study, the School Assessment Survey, the  Federal Policies in Local Schools study, the Professional Cultures in Improving High Schools study, and the Regional Educational Service Agency study. The two tools created by the project were a training program for field agents involved in school improvement efforts and a survey instrument developed during the School Assessment Survey project. A bibliography lists 45 publications or reports providing further information on the studies, primarily issued by Research for Better Schools or authored by Field Studies Project staff members.

Boyer); &quot;Horace's Compromise: The Dilemma of the American High School&quot; (Theodore R. Sizer); and &quot;A Place Called School&quot; (John Goodlad). Canada is not yet &quot;a nation at risk,&quot; because education is strongly entrenched as a provincial responsibility; a conservative noninterventionist Supreme Court influences the direction of education; and the timelag between the creation of educational ideas in the United States and their movement to Canada gives Canadians space to  evaluate and select the best of the ideas. However, embedded in these reports are statements and ideas that indicate a need for investigation in the Canadian context: two particular areas of need are good qualitative research on the adolescent in high school, and a general education curriculum that combines both the idea of education for citizenship and education for eventual on-the-job skill development. Finally, the American experience suggests the desirability of research in the Canadian setting on the influence that standardized testing programs have on educational practice, and on how to assess or describe higher order cognitive achievements.

The document also traces trends in methods for encouraging instructional innovation as these trends were influenced by the research findings. The report begins with an account of the curriculum reform movement, which featured nonteaching experts telling teachers how to change. The lack of change was first attributed to teacher failure and later to teacher unwillingness to change. The review then traces the impact of research on the growing understanding of several forces affecting innovation: the pressures limiting teacher participation, the value of shared effort and collegial support, the importance of an anthropological or cultural understanding of the teaching situation, the uses of  action research techniques, and the application of supervisory methods. The document concludes with a listing of 17 ways in which the methodology of teacher supervision should be modified to accommodate the research findings. (PGD)",

To find new sources of support these schools must adopt the techniques of development used successfully by colleges and universities. \"Development\" involves identifying, coordinating, and expanding the positive forces within an institution to enable that institution to meet its potential. The process includes efforts to improve the institution to match the image desired as well as to communicate that image to those offering support. Development focuses on four points: the quality of the product or service provided, the quality of the institution's  management, public perception of the institution, and the institution's ability to take advantage of available resources. Following an introduction to development concepts, this handbook offers practical considerations of public relations, financial resource development, and student recruitment. The school's publics are defined and the uses of public relations calendars and committees are outlined; essential elements in resource development programs are discussed and several specific methods for generating revenue are described; and techniques for persuading students, identifying potential students, and managing recruiting activities are presented.

The decision-making structure of the Catholic system is explained, and the roles of school boards, pastors, and principals are placed in perspective. The responsibilities of diocesan central offices and sponsoring religious orders are also covered. The publication then distinguishes between educational  policy created by boards of education and school rules and regulations set forth by school administrators.

After an introductory critique of past efforts to assess teacher \"traits\" or \"behaviors,\" the report defines task analysis, suggesting that it is better able to examine the appropriateness of teacher behavior in context than past attempts at categorizing and evaluating teacher behaviors or qualities. Eight major teacher tasks are then described, along with current research findings about their importance: (1) planning instruction; (2) assessing students; (3) clarifying behavioral rules and routines; (4) organizing the  classroom; (5) creating a learning set; (6) teaching to objectives; (7) providing for student practice; and (8) maintaining student involvement in learning and disciplining inappropriate behavior. Finally, four examples are provided of school districts that are putting the research on effective teaching into practice. Selected references are included. (TE)",

The issues under examination included homogeneous vs. heterogeneous grouping, class length, school-within-a-school or teaming, department chairs versus house coordinators, a flexible or modular scheduling as factors that might affect staff morale, communication, and student learning. Using an evaluation design, the research team undertook a descriptive case study of the match between school philosophy and the scheduling practices related to teacher teaming and student ability grouping. Data were collected from all school staff concerning opinions of the scheduling, teaming, and  ability grouping practices, along with self-report measures of staff emotional exhaustion, negative attitudes toward students, and feelings of personal accomplishment. Findings, reported in detail, suggest that low levels of emotional exhaustion and high feelings of personal accomplishment correlate strongly with provision of adequate time to reach time management and planning objectives. Researchers conclude that scheduling should include staff input to reflect individuals' need for effective planning time. References are included, along with five appendixes listing organizational changes at the school, sample surveys and results, school history, and interview questions. (TE)",

        "description":"This study examined curriculum procedures and the roles, decision-making processes, and perceptions of central administrators, building administrators, and teachers in five school districts. Qualitative data collection included taped interviews using a focused indepth interview schedule, field notes, observation, and document collection. The study of the curriculum processes in each district resulted in the development of a five-step curriculum model: preplanning, planning, writing, implementation, and revision. Naturalistic models developed in each district as the curriculum was affected by various influences. The findings suggest that a school district's environment has definite effects on the curriculum process and that an influential person is needed to monitor all stages of  the procedure. The findings also indicate that, despite a strong move toward centralization of the curriculum as a result of state mandates, teachers will derive a sense of satisfaction and \"ownership\" of curriculum documents only to the extent that they participate in curriculum planning and writing. A bibliography that includes books, articles, reports, and conference papers is appended. (Author/TE)",

Teachers covered by bargaining agreements, compared with teachers not covered, receive higher salaries and teach smaller classes. They also spend slightly less time instructing students but more time preparing for classes. The major difference detected in the study is that educational cost per pupil is 15 percent higher for union than for nonunion districts, while the average student in union districts scores 5 percent higher than students in nonunion districts. Union and nonunion districts also differ significantly in the way students are taught. Union districts make greater use of traditional classroom instruction and less use of specialists, aides, tutors, and independent programmed study.  These differences may account for the fact that union districts appear to work best for average students but less well for students well above and well below average. (Author/GJ)",

Among the topics addressed in the survey were mentors and mentoring functions. Respondents were asked to identify the sex and role of 3 mentors and to rate these mentors' helpfulness in 21 mentoring areas. Fewer job aspirants than incumbents  reported having mentors. Males were mentors in 1,133 pairs and women in 252 pairs. Men served as mentors for women in 434 cases and women for men in 128. Mentors for superintendents were most frequently superintendents, and mentors for all other groups were most frequently principals. Psychosocial rather than career functions were deemed more helpful by both men and women. Since women, both incumbents and aspirants, reported mentoring support, it was difficult to reconcile this with the lack of women in school administrative positions. (PGD)",

These methods in turn determine what we learn about the world and therefore how we define reality. As aspects of cultural science, teaching and supervision should not be studied using methods suitable for the natural sciences--the cultural sciences are mind-dependent and the natural sciences are mind-independent. Teaching and supervisory practices should not be bound to single standards, since effective practice is responsive to its own context. Models of teaching and supervision should not be applied restrictively, but as metaphors enabling the user to see situations in a new light and apply the new knowledge to practice. Each model can open up a particular view of reality but in  the process masks off other potential views. No model is exclusively true, and each model has worth that varies according to the goals toward which the model is applied. Models valuable for some purposes may be inappropriate for others. The selection of goals remains a matter of normative judgment. Models can be assessed in terms of their cogency and relevance, both of which may vary depending on the goals selected.

This study examines the extent of variation in leadership behavior and activities among urban high school principals. Data were collected through interviews with principals and teachers in national samples of urban comprehensive high schools and magnet high schools. The findings show that the extent of principal leadership varies widely among both comprehensive and magnet high schools. Comprehensive high school principals tend to provide more leadership in administrative areas than in educational areas; only a small minority are highly rated on all of the measures. Almost half of the magnet high school principals provide strong leadership in all areas. The extent of principal  leadership is also analyzed by differences in school and district contexts.

Interviews included highly structured and semistructured questions concerning the career and success patterns, circumstances that affected their present status, and the future role of black women as chief administrators of public school districts. The typical black woman superintendent is 46 years of age or older, married, and has two or more children. She began teaching in an elementary school and advanced to diverse supervisory positions by age 36. Doctorate degrees were held by 68 percent of the women. Overwhelmingly, the respondents feel that a combination of racism with sexism is the reason that black women hold so few superintendencies. However, the respondents  are very satisfied in their choice of career and would choose the same one again. They predict that, as school populations shift in urban centers from majority to minority enrollments, more black women will enter administration and advance to the superintendency at an earlier age. Recommendations to improve black women's career opportunities are listed and 14 references are appended. (MLF)",

These selection criteria were identified through a survey questionnaire and interviews at 18 representative schools in the Edmonton (Alberta) Public School District. As a result of analysis of these data, a three-level evaluation process has been devised, with progressively more detailed selection criteria. Level 1 defines the four basic functions of SIMS: school records, scheduling, student attendance, and grade processing. It also covers basic criteria such as cost, reliability of vendor, hardware capacity, and ease of use. The Level 2 selection criteria are more detailed, and are used  to determine whether a system meets the needs of a particular school. Level 3 evaluation, aimed at the few systems that are finalists in the selection process, involves functional and performance testing of all system modules in a real life environment. Evaluation at Level 3 is a two-phase process: first, each system is evaluated against the most detailed criteria, and second, the outcomes of individual product evaluations are summarized and compiled for comparison and final selection. Accordingly, two separate instruments are included: the SIMS Selection Criteria Level 3 working form, and the Comparison Summary and Review Form. Appended are the questionnaire and interview forms used to gather the information from which these criteria were derived, and a detailed scoring comparison form.  (TE)",

        "description":"This report comprises a detailed evaluation of two minicomputer-based school information management systems for use at the senior high school level: (1) Prompt Automated Scheduling System (PASS) by Mid-American Corporation and locally developed software, which runs on an IBM minicomputer, and (2) Student Administration System (SAS) by SIERRA Software Systems, Inc., which runs on the Digital Equipment VAX family of computers. These two systems were evaluated against six major factors, each defined by a detailed and comprehensive set of criteria: product scope and function, ease of use, technical considerations, support and services, product qualifications, and vendor. All key system capabilities were tested as they related to database creation and maintenance, prescheduling,  scheduling, transition to operational status (and semester turnover), attendance recording and reporting, progress recording and reporting, report generation, and utility functions. Each product evaluation describes the testing environment and conditions, lists evaluation results and observations, and summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of the system. Evaluation data are then summarized and compared first from the senior and then from the junior high school perspective. Results indicate that considerable development work is required for both systems to realize complete school information management systems, and that these minicomputer-based systems are not suitable for use by individual schools. Six appendixes are included: the general questionnaire from which the criteria were  derived, the interview guide and detailed checklist, the detailed scoring comparison form, Mid-American PASS screen and program functions, IBM 4341 to VAS 11/725 data transfer, and recent system developments.

        "description":"Five of Canada's ten provinces--Newfoundland, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta--maintain systems of publicly supported religious schools, variously referred to as denominational, dissentient, or separate schools. In each of these, funding is shared between the province and the local communities, with the latter depending, for the most part, on property taxes. This paper describes for each of the provinces in question the particular problems that arise in the process, examines the relationship between property tax arrangements and student access, and makes suggestions for change. The first section defines the two basic types of religious school system: denominational (operated by a specific denomination for its own members), and dissentient or separate (in which members  of Protestant or Roman Catholic minorities withdraw from the public system to form their own school system). The second section describes arrangements for property taxation to support religious schools in each of the five provinces. Footnotes are included. (TE)",

Findings disclose an apparent reliance on bureaucratic procedures and externally defined purposes, and a sensitivity to adult (political) influences in the less effective schools.

A Policy Delphi method was used to identify changes in education that are both probable and possible on account of the introduction of computers, and to explore potential patterns for arriving at a desired future. A critical element in the study was the Delphi panel, composed of 18 individuals with a knowledge of computers and a background in education. Data collection included a pilot study followed by three distinct iterations or rounds. Developments identified as probable and undesirable included underuse of equipment, problems related to the allocation of equipment, lack of appropriate software, piracy, confidentiality of files and  information, equity, funding, resistance to change, software and hardware inertia restricting implementation of improvements in hardware, migration of human resources, and increased and conflicting demands on educational organizations. Desirable possibilities include development of a local software industry tailored to provincial curriculum, a strong emphasis on computer-related inservice, an awareness of the social effects of computers, and increased parent involvement in school matters. Potential patterns for achieving a desired future include increased software development and evaluation, increased levels of funding, inservice, a recognition of the need for policies related to educational computing, curriclular development, preservice, planning, security procedures, and communication  among organizations and stakeholders. Nine major conclusions, from general to specific, are outlined and discussed. References are included. (TE)",

Schools serving a more affluent and able clientele may offer more rigorous and enriched programs of study, and students in college preparatory curricular programs may have greater access to advanced courses within schools. This notion is tested with a longitudinal, nationally representative sample of public school students from the High School and Beyond data set. The results show few effects of school composition and offerings between schools, but important within-school influences of curricular tracking and course taking. In most cases, the difference in achievement between tracks exceeds the gap between students in school and dropouts, suggesting that students' choice  of courses in school may be even more important for the development of cognitive skills than whether one is in school or not.

The STETS demonstration is described in terms of its model, underlying research issues, and the data collection process. Implementation of the model is the focus of chapter 3 which examines the sample selection process, the response rate to surveys, the quality of data, and the use of analytic methodologies (impact analyses and benefit-cost analyses). The succeeding six chapters document STETS impact on the following aspects: (1) employment,  earnings, and other labor market outcomes; (2) training and schooling; (3) public transfer dependence; (4) economic status, independence, and life-style; (5) benefits and costs; and (6) participants' outputs. Among key findings are that STETS improved the postprogram employment prospects of mentally retarded young adults, that participants benefitted substantially from the program, and that STETS created intangible benefits by increasing available employment and social opportunities. Policy conclusions are noted regarding program potential to mitigate the independence and employment problems of mentally retarded young adults, program design and targeting, and program benefits and costs.

Application of play therapy to mentally retarded clients is explored in terms of two questions: (1) at what level do mentally retarded persons play? and (2) what kind of play offers therapeutic possibilities? Therapeutic benefits are ascribed to symbolic play, sand and water play, provision of opportunities for behavior change, and encouraging positive outcomes of the relationship with the therapist. Challenges to the therapist in working with mentally retarded clients are noted, including the client's past experiences with rejection. (CL)",

An overview of language development and use reviews the need for four types of skills and knowledge: grammatical or linguistic command of a language, sociolinguistic competence, discourse competence, and strategic competence. Programing implications for minority language preschoolers are noted, including the importance of developing a strong, stable first language before introducing English as a second language. A review of existing resources and programs cites trends, including the emphasis on moving from the primary language into English as quickly as possible with limited data on proficiency skills to support this process. Issues for further study are identified  in assessment and diagnosis, program services, staffing, and curriculum materials. Six recommendations are offered, including that young children should be taught about their culture in the preferred language of the family and community. (CL)",

Critical aspects of instruction for generalization are identified, including student understanding of the  goal of the task and sufficient opportunity for practice.

Metamemory was found to be deficient only in the subgroup of LD children with a short-term memory deficit (as indexed by poor performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised digit span subtest). LD children without this memory deficit did not differ from normal children in metamemory. Relationships among memory, metamemory, and reading and math achievement were also explored. It was concluded that metamemory deficits, previously thought to characterize LD children in general, are found only in a relatively small  subgroup of LD children.

Key findings from the study of teacher effectivness are noted, mildly handicapped students as learners are defined, and information on teaching strategies that have been found OK or not-so-OK in educating mildly handicapped children is considered. Also provided is a teaching effectiveness matrix for assessing the efficiency of instructional strategies. The matrix rates two variables: (1) amount of teacher effort required to implement the strategy and (2) amount of learning by students as a result of implementing the strategy. It is suggested that through careful study of teacher behaviors and  implementation of the findings, learning among the mildly handicapped can be greatly enhanced. (Author/CL)",

Results indicated that 54% view the S.E.D. criteria as not very adequate at best and 67% agree or strongly agree with the proposed adoption of a set of  classifications from the DSM III to specify type and severity of emotional disturbance. On 9 of 10 items directly comparing the S.E.D. guidelines and DSM III, the majority voiced strong consistent support for DSM III. Associated with the positive opinions about DSM III were: (1) respondent's district used it, (2) respondent had adequate knowledge of DSM III, (3) respondent had experience with DSM III, and (4) respondent considered the S.E.D. criteria inadequate.

The special educator, in most cases, was the professional most often involved in conducting assessment in the developmental areas. Findings suggested the need to examine how the types of personnel involved in screening influence results and the extent to which duplication actually exists or is only perceived to  exist.

Few teachers have time for evaluation built into their schedules, even though most feel it would be advantageous.

Results indicated that approximately half of the programs had formal written exit criteria and half did not. The most commonly cited criterion for children exiting a program was chronological age. Results also suggested that other factors, such as formal test results, team staffing decisions, and the child's developmental skill level, play a role in determining whether a child will exit from a program. Significant differences appear to exist between exit criteria listed by programs  with formal written exit criteria and those without.

Some students verbalized aloud while solving problems (continuous verbalization); those in a second condition verbalized only during the first half of training (discontinued verbalization); students in a third condition did not verbalize (no verbalization). All students were periodically monitored and either received effort feedback during the first half of training, effort feedback during  the second half of training, or no effort feedback. Continuous verbalization led to higher self-efficacy, and effort feedback promoted these achievement behaviors more than no feedback. Delivering effort feedback during the first half of training enhanced effort attributions. Findings support the notion that private speech can help regulate task performance.

Information was drawn from the progress of a statewide five-year plan, a citizens' panel report, and syllabus and curriculum reports from Illinois schools. It was found that Illinois schools provide little opportunity for initiating study or encouraging continuation of a second language, and that a significant discrepancy exists between the need for second language  proficiencies and the number of persons developing them. It is concluded that Illinois must take stronger action to provide language programs to develop usable proficiency from elementary through secondary grades, guarantee access to those programs for all students, increase second language enrollments, expand the range of languages offered, develop the international dimension of education, develop the existing skills and increase the supply of second language teachers, and improve the quality and effectiveness of instructional models and materials.

This would mean therefore that instead of stressing speaking in a beginning L2 class, the curriculum would be firmly based on receptive skills and that adequate meaningful exposure to the language would precede any attempt to train productive skills. As receptive skills are developed, a more prominent role would be given to developing and testing skills in fluency, appropriateness, and accuracy. The student would be kept continually active in the comprehension of a rich linguistic environment and in the creation of  meaningful utterances, which are the primary means of language acquisition.

        "author":["Ringbom, Hakan"],
        "description":"A distinction is made today between second-language acquisition and foreign-language learning based on the individual's internal processes of learning and the degree of consciousness brought to the learning task. In a second-language acquisition situation, the language is spoken in the immediate environment of the learner, who has good opportunities to use the language by participating in natural communication situations. In a foreign-language learning situation, the language is not spoken in the learner's immediate environment, although mass media may provide opportunities for practicing receptive skills. The learner has little or no opportunity to use the language in natural communication situations. Other, more specific situational distinctions are based on the time spent on  language learning, the quality and structure of the input, the teacher's role, lack of teacher, and the kind of skills developed. Individual learner differences contributing to the distinction include motivation, activity/passivity, the experience of \"language shock,\" social and affective factors, age, native language background, the learning processes used, monitoring, the linguistic results, learning ability, and communicative strategies. Foreign-language teaching can gain from an understanding of the role of both individual learner characteristics and situational differences related to the two distinct language learning processes.

        "description":"Simplification of text as a pedagogical technique in second language instruction implies: (1) the selection of a restricted set of features from the full range of foreign language resources (linguistic simplification) and/or (2) the rearrangement of content of foreign language messages (content simplification) for purposes of instructional efficiency. The second option is more central to the communicative approach to language teaching, where a minimal level of formal linguistic competence is necessary for well-defined and restricted communication tasks; the first option results in just a contrived laboratory text. Both types of simplification result in a reduction of authenticity. Factors accompanying the simplification of instructional materials include lexical factors such as  word frequency, degree of abstractness, lexical density, paraphrasing, and substitution of word meaning for connotations; syntactic factors such as sentence splitting, deletion of irrelevant information, or addition of examples or glosses; and text and discourse factors such as temporal organization of segments, text organization with reference to the main topic and subtopics, theme progression, and addition of metatext. The use of some parameters of simplification is illustrated with a sample text and two simplications. Two pages of references are included. (MSE)",

        "description":"A technique for teaching skills in reading in a foreign language is based on the assumptions that the development of foreign-language reading skills is similar to the development of native-language reading skills, that the purpose of reading is to integrate new and existing knowledge, and that the reader's knowledge, opinions, or experience should be emphasized as much as the text content. The technique involves the use of pre-reading questions exploring the reader's opinions, questions accompanying the text that encourage evaluation of the opinions expressed in the text as it is read, and exercises that encourage the reader to predict what subsequent text will contain, a feature that is especially useful for teaching languages for scientific purposes. Use of the approach among  science students in an English-medium faculty in a Middle East university, where traditional reading instruction was expected, required presenting the prediction exercises as a comprehension test and adjusting the technique based on the students' responses. The advantage to the use of prediction is that it allows an insight into the cognitive processes at work when a reader approaches a text, and it emphasizes the role of background knowledge and experience in comprehension. The immediate value of this type of work lies in the break it makes with established habits of looking at texts as completed artefacts, rather than as opportunities for mental interaction. The long-term value of predictive work has yet to be proven. (MSE)",

        "description":"Australia launched its initial program of teaching English to adult migrants in the late 1940's. At times, bilingual methods were used, a trend that is returning. At that time, attempts were made to educate Australian people in the acceptance rather than rejection of migrants. Today there exists a variety of full-time, intensive, and accelerated courses in addition to the evening, distance, and correspondence programs. While efforts have progressed, there is much to do to overcome prejudice between and within minority groups and to create a well-integrated multicultural society. Demographic reports have begun to acknowledge migrants' social and cultural impact. The child migrant education program began in 1970, but still needs well-trained personnel. In a major shift in policy,  migrants are encouraged to maintain their native language and cultural heritage, and ethnic schools and bilingual curricula are increasing. However, early and uninterrupted English learning is favored, and there are some schools of high migrant density where the children's needs are not being met due to inadequate teacher training, despite teacher interest and effort. While migrant children's presence in school does not cause problems, lack of effective communication with parents has become problematic, and efforts are being made to make ethnic parents active school and community participants.

Overlapping and interruption were distinguished from cooperative (supportive) simultaneity of speech, and a \"turn\" was defined as a recognized utterance. The primary finding was a high degree of simultaneous speech, with over 90 percent of turns having some form of overlap or interruption. The conversational characteristics revealed in this analysis were compared to the characteristics of separate English and Spanish conversations between Spanish-English bilinguals, in which more simultaneous speech was found during the Spanish conversations. The contrast in conversational strategies underlines  the different cultural perceptions of simultaneous speech as polite or impolite, and it suggests a need for a definition of \"turn\" that accommodates simultaneous speech differently and a need for further investigation of the quantitative and qualitative variation in simultaneous speech across languages.

Four dimensions of a teacher's cultural role were specifically addressed: being an example, explaining and interpreting, teaching interculturally, and listening and helping (being a friend). Findings indicate a range of teacher viewpoints on each dimension. On the dimension of &quot;being an example,&quot; viewpoints ranged from willing acceptance of that role to denial; most simply acknowledged the function. All respondents reported various degrees of explaining and interpreting Canadian culture.  The amount of time spent and the extent of the explanation depended on student language level, teacher willingness to stray from the planned lesson, and the immediate social situation. Teachers perceived that the function of teaching interculturally and confronting conflicts depended on their view of the students and the program type in which they were involved; those working with the most recently arrived and least fluent were the most likely to confront bigotry in the classroom. On the dimension of listening and helping, teacher response ranged from substantial involvement with to lack of awareness of students' personal problems, with most teachers at least approached by students.

Eight native speakers of Russian were asked to rate the grammatical acceptability of certain verbs in specific texts in which repeated motion toward a single, identified goal was clearly indicated. They were asked to choose whether the indeterminate or the determinate verb of motion was acceptable in the given context. In addition to repetition, the factors involved in the selection of an indeterminate verb to denote repeated motion events include numerical and adverbial quantifiers, and sequencing (overlapping or non-overlapping events). Singularization (e.g., &quot;each time&quot;)  in the text favors the determinate verb of motion as does the expression of progressive meaning with explicit reference to the emotional state of the &quot;figure,&quot; that is, the object in motion. The discussion leads to two conclusions: first, determinate verbs are sensitive to the semantic/syntactic factors of overlapping/non-overlapping sequencing, processual meaning, and singularization, predictable by the relationship of these verbs to the temporal parameter; and secondly, speaker choice plays a large and somewhat complicated part in verb selection. The texts used are in both Russian and English. (MSE)",

The subjects were approximately 30 college students in a second-semester elementary French course. Five sentences were constructed for each of four sentence types (active declarative, active interrogative, negative, and negative interrogative); each of the five sentences in each group was given a different degree of visual clarity or blurring by making multiple carbon copies on a typewriter. The dependent variable was the point of clarity at which grammaticality and sentence meaning were clearly recognized. Subjects were given a short  review of sentence types and were asked to indicate at what point of clarity they understood each sentence and its type. The results suggest that recognition of grammatical type and its underlying declarative and/or interrogative features provides a powerful cue in reading even when perceptual processing is obscured. The finding that declarative sentences require less time to evaluate than negative sentences has theoretical implications for future research. (MSE)",

Attention is directed to: goals of each of the institutions in establishing the program, characteristics of individual programs, the number of faculty who have taken the early retirement option, and perceived strengths and weaknesses of the program. Initiatives for the three retirement incentive plans differed: one came from a joint faculty and administrative committee, the second was created and developed by administrators, and the third was developed by faculty members. Goals of the program for two of the universities were to reallocate resources. One school  encouraged early retirements in overstaffed departments so that faculty positions could be moved to understaffed departments. The other school sought to reallocate institutional resources by guaranteeing part-time reemployment to any faculty member electing early retirement. The goal of the third university was to provide for a renewal of the professoriate while reducing the total number of faculty at the institution.

Positions of advocacy and opposition to post-tenure evaluation are identified, along with practical considerations that institutions might consider before modifying or implementing a formal process for post-tenure evaluation. Three purposes of post-tenure evaluation are identified: to supply documentation for removal for incompetence; to provide input for decisions in the areas of reductions in force, merit raises, and promotions; and especially to support faculty development and improved instruction. Five principles of faculty evaluation are recommended: a clearly defined purpose, multiple sources of input to the  evaluation, identifying areas and criteria to be assessed, measurable standards, and a flexible and individualized evaluation plan. Appended is a summary of a survey of 30 institutions, 16 of which had a formal post-tenure evaluation plan. Information is provided on evaluation objectives, effectiveness, frequency, participants, process followed, and the names of the 16 institutions. Also appended are 16 pages of references and information on sources of sample rating forms for faculty evaluation. (SW)",

The effects of gender and academic rank on the incidence of spillover between work and nonwork were assessed. Faculty from humanities and natural sciences departments and two professional schools were studied. Interviews and questionnaires were completed by assistant professors, associate professors, full professors under age 50, and full professors age 50 and over. Seventy-two percent of the sample were male, and 28% were female. Information was obtained on career choice, opportunities and constraints, transitions and aspirations, the effect of life away from work on academic careers, interests,  incentives, and work and nonwork satisfactions. Both family-work linkages and leisure-work linkages were examined. Spillover was found for this population, although no significant sex differences were found. While half of the sample reported positive spillover between work and family or personal life, half also described stresses in balancing time and commitment to family with career aspirations. No significant differences in spillover of the work-family linkage was found by rank; however, significant differences were associated with rank in spillover of work and leisure. (SW)",

Full professors, associate professors, and assistant professors from the humanities and natural sciences departments and two professional schools were administered interviews and questionnaires.

Interviews and questionnaires provided information on career choices, opportunities/constraints, transitions and aspirations, interests, preferences, incentives, job  satisfaction, and life satisfactions. The critical career events were linked to role and status changes and formal opportunities for professional development. Faculty agreed that opportunities to learn new things and to take on new challenges and responsibilities were essential to maintaining faculty vitality.

Program planning and implementation and outcomes of cross-school observation are considered. Visits by small groups of teachers to the cooperating school were helpful in launching the project. An important factor in the implementation phase was having someone coordinate the arrangements, such as scheduling observations and arranging for substitute teachers. Participating teachers' reactions to the project, which were elicited through interviews, are  summarized. Also discussed are other CPSI components: the steering committee, school development seminars, and joint department meetings. New roles for teachers that have arisen out of the program are also considered, including working on the steering committee and serving as on-site student teacher supervisors. The next steps for continued improvement of a program of professional self-renewal are also addressed. The participating schools, all in California, are: Saint Mary's College in Moraga; California High School in San Ramon Valley; and Foothill High School in Alameda County. (SW)",

The following concerns were investigated for 1972 seniors who attained a bachelor's degree in the humanities by October 1979: pathways to the degree, differences between students earning humanities degrees and students earning degrees in other fields, differences between humanities and nonhumanities majors that were evident in 1972, and differences between 1972 and 1980 humanities majors. Student pathways were: the extent of high school  academic studies, college entry and attendance at two- or four-year colleges, enrollment in a four-year college after two years of study, majors, and field of work students expect for themselves at age 30. Results were also assessed by student characteristics: sex; socioeconomic status; race (White, Black, and Hispanic); ability, and educational attainment (graduate and professional school studies).

A brief history of the Higher Education Act over the 20 years since its inception in 1965 is traced, and the role of the federal government in higher education is addressed. The centerpiece of the legislation was an educational opportunity grant for students of exceptional financial need. The law also created a new program of federally guaranteed and subsidized commercial loans to students from low- and middle-income families. Other titles in the act authorized grants to college libraries, aid to developing institutions, and expansion of the 1963 construction grant programs. As the Higher Education Act is being reauthorized, the Reagan  Administration is proposing funding cuts for higher education, restricted access to Pell Grants, caps on eligibility for guaranteed student loans at various income levels, and elimination of other programs such as aid for libraries. The success of the Higher Education Act in providing access to the disadvantaged is noted, and other provisions of the act are also considered, including international education and graduate education. Financial aid to students at private career colleges and schools is also addressed. The text of House Concurrent Resolution 207 is appended. (SW)",

Initial studies and policies leading up to the 1960 master plan that guided the first period of growth and expansion are covered and the impact of the master plan is examined, along with changes in society and higher education during the 1960s, 1970s, and the early 1980s, and the prospects for the next 15 to 20 years in terms of expected need and accommodation. Descriptions are provided of three major facets of growth and change that policy must address: probable numbers of prospective students, places actually available on campuses for these students, and costs and capital funding where existing facilities are inadequate. The analysis rests on two major variables, enrollment estimates and  capacity calculations. Major problems and opportunities arising from expected expansion and change in higher education are also addressed. Long-range planning for expected growth and change at the University of California, the California State University, and the community colleges is discussed, along with assumptions about student numbers and characteristics.

The cost of frontloading is estimated in terms of additional institutional expenditures for instruction. Attention is directed to: various dimensions of the costing question, reasons why instructional costs tend to be lower at the lower-division level, and data illustrating the extent to which these costs differ by level of instruction at various types of institutions. Two models for  making cost estimates are also examined. The first cost estimation model focuses on total direct expenditures for instruction, which are allocated by level of instruction, based on enrollments and on cost-ratios comparing costs per student for the lower, upper, and graduate divisions. The second model focuses on the costs of acquiring the additional faculty needed to provide lower-division students with a learning environment similar to that provided to upper-division students. Steps in calculating costs for frontloading are identified, along with a set of simultaneous mathematical equations. (SW)",

Three dimensions of time in colleges and universities are important: formal/informal; historical; and seasonal/ceremonial. The environment, external constituencies, historical traditions, and participants all influence organizational time. The concepts of formal and informal uses of time can be illustrated by a president's &quot;open door&quot; policy and the formalized procedures of a unionized faculty. Historical time places present actions in the context of the organizational past. Seasonal and ceremonial time generates activities that demand administrative awareness of the culture. Time can be viewed  as a critical element in an organization's socially constructed reality. The view accounts for how society affects change and how the inner processes of the organization focus time within larger spheres. Institutional conflict can be precipitated by different frames of time being in tension with one another (e.g., a traditionally slow-changing institution can come into conflict with a rapidly changing environment). It is concluded that managers who assess their colleges from a cultural viewpoint can better understand how to effectively manage time. (SW)",

Differences in the average distance between a focal institution and its competitors were examined based on variations in institutional characteristics (e.g., control, enrollment size, selectivity, type, program emphasis, and region). The names of competing institutions were obtained from responses to a previous study of colleges and universities. Findings support the view that enrollment competition is primarily a local affair and that  enrollment markets are highly segmented geographically. Private institutions had the greatest average distance followed by religious institutions. Additional findings concerning distance and the variables of control, size, selectivity, program emphasis, and region are presented and tabulated.

It was found that IPS appears to reasonably assess most of its constructs/dimensions; however, its use of ambiguous language and weak assessment of five scales are problem areas, and the questionnaire also lacks a &quot;don't know&quot; response category. While IPS may be useful at the beginning of an institutional self-study in identifying institutional strengths and weaknesses, it fails to investigate what an institution's scores on dimensions actually mean and how conditions are related  and affect one another. Variables assessed by IPS within the following eight categories are identified: changes in the institutional environment, institutional functioning, revenues, enrollments, institutional culture, strategy, resource allocation, and institutional effectiveness. The IPS is also compared with the Institutional Functioning Inventory, Institutional Goals Inventory, and the Needs Assessment Survey.

The case study involved a cost effectiveness study that used longitudinal microdata to track the effects of treatment. Experimental clinical treatment was provided for children at a major research university medical center. The children were observed for clinical symptoms (e.g., aggression, depression) at the time of admission, discharge, and  followup. The clinical program was effective despite, not because of the university's internal management. Weak institutional integration caused by the highly decentralized university structure compounded the problems generated by concern for external compliance.

        "description":"The interaction between computer/information technology and the teaching professoriate is considered. Based on a model introduced in 1984, the first encounter with computing is viewed as an alien culture into which the novice must be socialized. Three distinct stages occur in socialization: reality shock, confusion, and attempts at control. To ease the transition of the teaching faculty into the computing culture, the college needs to develop programs to help faculty progress through each of these stages. Novices need to be forewarned about the nature of computing work and about its strengths and weaknesses. The effectiveness of different programs of anticipatory socialization on the reduction of reality shock need to be examined. Among the considerations for schools are:  providing hands-on experience through inservice workshops and conferences determining how often workshops should be offered, and deciding on the usefulness of general discussions of computer capabilities and applications. At the stage of exerting control or mastery, two major issues should be studied: sources of faculty resistance to computerization and mechanisms to overcome resistance. Psychological reactance, fear of technology, and role conflict and role reversal are sources of faculty resistance to computerization. (SW)",

        "description":"A study was undertaken to determine whether professors as role models are part of the collegiate experience of the majority of students and what specific role models the faculty convey. Implications of findings for the improvement of teaching and management in higher education were also assessed. Students and faculty from the College of Education at the University of Nevada and the University of Idaho were studied. Student and faculty questionnaires were administered to undergraduate and graduate students and junior and senior professors. Four major role models were identified: academic, mentor, citizen, and friend. The academic model represented the academician and scholarly person, while the mentor was represented by a professor who was personally interested in students, could  individualize programs and learning, and provide an exemplary personal model. The citizen model was someone who believed in community interaction and represented the academic profession outside the campus. Finally, the friend was seen as a warm and friendly professor who could casually talk with students and relate to them in an informal manner. Since both students and faculty agreed that the roles of professional educator and mentor were most important, staff development activities and other approaches to enhance these types of faculty involvement were recommended. Student and faculty questionnaires are appended. (SW)",

To take advantage of information technology, the user needs to find and manipulate the text of others  through computer searching and retrieval. Mastering the rules of a particular machine and using the computer to scan a text are important skills. Efficient word processing is addressed briefly, along with a variation on word processing called outline processors or idea organizers.

In addition to determining the achievement of high school graduates who applied to higher education in 1980 and 1981, information was collected on their preferences for admission to higher education institutions and disciplines. Previous achievement and track were examined for three student samples: applicants, successful students in all higher education, and successful students in university education. Multiple regression analysis was employed to determine how each of the following variables affected high school grade point average and national examination scores: gender, student's work status, occupation of mother and father,  education of mother and father, number of siblings, previous attainment, track, geographic origin, preparation for the national examination, week-hours of private tutoring, and education and operational school characteristics (e.g., enrollments, staffing). Among results was the finding that personal variables were more pronounced in Athens and the urban centers, and social and school variables were more pronounced in the rural areas and the smaller cities. Additional findings and information on the Greek education system and college admission are presented, and data tables and diagrams are included. (SW)",

Dimensions of openness include: greater access to college, flexible entrance requirements, less constraints of having to be somewhere at a particular time, award of advance credit for university credit work undertaken elsewhere, award of credit toward a degree for nonformal learning, and independent study that is self-paced. Organizational and administrative innovation in the production of home study course packages at the British Open  University (UKOU), at Canada's Athabasca University, and at Australia's Deakin University is addressed, along with curricular and instructional innovation, including the use of systematic feedback from students and academic colleagues. An example of an innovation that worked is the course team at UKOU.

Obstacles for using effectiveness information are identified, along with the broad role of information in college decision-making. To assess information-based change efforts, the following types of variables are important: the structure and process of institutional decision-making; the use of information in decision-making; and strategies employed to induce change based on assessment information.  Specific variables include: institutional type and mission, school size, array of programs, locus of decision-making; resource flexibility, the quality and extent of available information, pressure for information use by top administrators, utilization of unit resources, and the integration of the change effort with ongoing activities.

Data sources included reports of state coordinating or governing boards, institutional research studies and dissertation research, and studies conducted by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems. There are systematic differences in cost ratios per credit hour by type of institution (i.e., baccalaureate, comprehensive, doctoral, research, and doctoral and research). With a few exceptions, the larger and more complex the institution, the larger the  cost ratios. In considering differences by discipline and institution, comprehensive institutions had relatively high cost ratios in the sciences, both national and social. This occurred when comparing upper- to lower-division levels as well as masters to lower division. Very low costs at the lower-division level for mathematics and the social sciences, and relatively high costs at the upper-division level for the laboratory-oriented sciences, were found at both doctoral and comprehensive institutions.

        "description":"Results of a survey of the states to determine state incentive programs for graduate education are presented. Attention is directed to three types of initiatives that are receiving special attention in the states: (1) programs to endow faculty chairs (eminent scholars program); (2) funding for special program initiatives or \"centers of excellence\"; and (3) initiatives to promote applied research centers or other types of business-university linkages. For each state, efforts in three types of incentive programs are described. The eminent scholars program, which is a relatively new development, is designed to provide permanent sources of funds that can be used to attract and retain outstanding faculty for major state universities. This has been done through incentive programs that  usually match private giving dollar for dollar with state funds. Targeted state support for centers of excellence is often aimed at promoting state economic development in certain fields, but has also been targeted to other objectives such as improving teacher education programs. State programs to enhance applied research activities and to strengthen higher education-business linkages have diversity in design and are often tailored to the particular economic structure and climate of the region.

        "description":"Coordination of higher education as practiced in three similar organizational forms is assessed: the statewide governing board, the regulatory coordinating board, and the advisory board. Attention is directed to why coordination is important, criticism of coordination, kinds of organizations used, the accomplishments and weaknesses of the agencies, and pending issues for coordination. Two broad categories of agencies are common: a single statewide governing board for all public colleges and universities (eliminating all the individual institutional boards); and a coordinating board juxtaposed between the governor/legislature and the institutional governing boards that embraces all of higher education, public and private. Both categories of agencies are headed by boards consisting  primarily or exclusively of lay persons appointed by the governor for overlapping terms. The strengths of state coordination for the following major functions are addressed: planning, budgeting, program review, and policy analysis. Issues for the 1980s and beyond are considered, including attracting the most able to the teaching profession, competition for students and funds between public and private institutions, and the consequences of the popularity of large public research universities.

        "description":"Results of research on predictors of organizational responses to declining enrollments at 56 small to medium-sized colleges and universities are discussed. Decline was experienced from 1978-1979 to 1981-1982. Severity of decline was selected as an objective predictor of organizational response, while internal agreement on mission and attributions of cause, controllability, and stability of decline were selected as subjective predictors of response. Two types of responses were examined: those that emphasize efficiency (operating responses) and those that represent a change in product/market mix (strategic responses). Path analysis indicated that severity of decline was not directly related to the types of responses that the organizations take following a period of decline.  Instead, agreement on mission had a direct negative effect on both operating and strategic types of responses, and this effect increased as the result of the mediating perceptual variables of control and stability. Perceived cause of decline and other perceptual variables were useful in predicting types of response. Comparing subject and objective predictors of responses to decline revealed that agreement on mission is a better predictor of response than is severity of decline. Implications for future research are offered. Five pages of references are included. (SW)",

        "description":"A survey of all colleges and universities in 13 western states was conducted by the Northwest Task Force on Higher Educational Information Technologies in mid-1984 to obtain information that could be used to: (1) describe current instructional applications of video, audio, and computer technologies; (2) facilitate networking among educators who share common concerns; (3) identify obstacles to more effective use of information technologies; and (4) determine the types of problems educators would like to work on in collaboration with colleagues at other institutions. Additional insight into some of the policy issues related to the use of information technologies was sought through a survey of the State Higher Education Executive Officer (SHEEO) in each state. Analysis of the  responses indicates that computers are being used to service larger proportions of the student body than either video or audio cassettes, with computers used more in the scientific disciplines and video and audio in the social sciences and humanities; white collar professionals are the single largest category of students being served via information technologies; the reporting institutions are active participants in technology-oriented networks; and 8 of the 13 western states have established statewide task forces to deal with information technologies in general. This report provides both summaries of the major findings and detailed analyses of the results of the two surveys, as well as discussions of the implications of the findings and numerous tables presenting data for the region as a  whole. Copies of the questionnaires used are appended. (THC)",

        "description":"Drawing on testimony presented at hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and Safety of the House of Representatives conducted between February 28 and June 12, 1984, this staff report addresses the general topic of video display terminals (VDTs) and possible health hazards in the workplace. An introduction presents the history of the development of VDTs and summarizes current scientific knowledge about VDT, with emphasis on the fear of radiation exposure. Figures are used to illustrate both how a VDT works and how VDT radiation is measured. Reproductive hazards from VDTs are discussed, including results of three surveys (Newspaper Guild-Mount Sinai, 9 to 5, and Canadian Scientists) and a proposed study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Remarks are also included from (1) witnesses from various labor organizations--9 to 5, the Service Employees International Union, the Communications Workers of America, and the Newspaper Guild--speaking for employees who use VDTs; (2) witnesses representing employers and business equipment manufacturers; and (3) a group of witnesses representing various aspects of the health professions. Findings and conclusions are followed by extensive appendices, which include: a witness list; a synopsis of testimony by various witnesses before the subcommittee; remarks on video display terminals and ELF/VLF (extra low frequency/very low frequency) electromagnetic fields; data on human factors standards for visual display units and the design of work stations, display packaging characteristics, display  image characteristics, and lighting and reflectance; and a transcript of a demonstration of instruments for measuring radiation that was presented before the subcommittee by representatives of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.

        "description":"In 1984, summer bridge students in the Indiana University Learning Skills Center were asked to complete an open-ended questionnaire on PLATO computer assisted instruction (CAI) used in their study skills courses. Of 226 students responding to the survey, 175 (77%) had chosen to use PLATO; 86 students used both the psychology and sociology review lessons, while 49 used only the former and 35 only the latter. The remaining students used only lessons which were not directly related to the study skills program, e.g., math or English language lessons. Students used PLATO for a variety of reasons, i.e., convinced by instructors, attracted to the computer format, persuaded by friends, reduction of study time, better understanding of course materials, or to gain experience on a computer.  Although trained neither in computer science nor in evaluation of education programs, the students identified each of four requisites for success identified in literature discussing CAI effectiveness: (1) implementation must be voluntary; (2) it must be part of a larger, overall educational program and implemented in conjunction with larger educational objectives; (3) the software must take advantage of the computer's interactive capabilities and it must be of pedagogical quality; and (4) the student must not be in primary control of the pacing. It is suggested that students have a wealth of knowledge which educators could and should tap in order to vastly improve the effectiveness of educational programs using computers. A list of references and copy of the student questionnaire are  provided. (JB)",

        "description":"In 1980, Wichita State University received a grant to introduce microcomputers as interactive teaching tools in large science classrooms. Through this grant, 18 faculty in 11 departments developed software modules illustrating concepts that are often difficult to teach by usual lecture methods. To determine whether the use of microcomputers in large screen interactive demonstrations would promote more positive student attitudes towards computers, a questionnaire was administered to two groups of students (experimental and control) on a pre- and post-test basis. Students exposed to computer instruction (the experimental group) included 78 in engineering courses, 57 in chemistry, 47 in physics, and 18 in computer science. The control group consisted of 148 students enrolled in a  non-microcomputer biology course. Part 1 of the questionnaire was a 17-item &quot;Beliefs about Computers&quot; scale designed to reflect students' general attitudes toward computers. Part 2 consisted of 12 items concerning the use of computers for instructional purposes. Statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups on post-test belief scores supporting the notion that exposure to the microcomputers in classroom demonstrations fosters more positive beliefs about computers. Analysis of Part 2 items showed positive mean pre-post attitude changes on all 12 items, while a positive attitude change was noted for the control group on only one item. A list of six references and author biographies are provided. (JB)",

A general description of a reflective optical laser videodisc is presented, as well as the equipment necessary to use a videodisc program. The categorization of videodisc systems according to their level of interactivity is explained: (1) Level 1--a stand-alone videodisc player which may allow dual audio and random access of frames but has no memory or processing power; (2) Level 2--a stand-alone educational/industrial player allowing disc control through an internal programmable microprocessor; (3) Level 3--a system which adds the power of  an external computer through the connection of an interface device; and (4) more sophisticated systems which have capabilities far beyond those of the original Level 3 system. Educational uses of videodiscs are also discussed, including simulating expensive or dangerous procedures or human interactions; teaching standardized procedures; storing audiovisual databases; showing visual details and reviewing and comparing visual materials; and using the two audio tracks to store different information for foreign language instruction, or for adapting materials for varied ability levels. Finally, several educational projects that are experimenting with the principles of interactive video are described, and resources for learning more about videodiscs in education are presented, including three  organizations, three books, and several periodicals.

Sections 3 through 6 provide guidelines for data collection; data analysis; the presentation and interpretation of results; and  developing a workforce planning system. Case studies of surveys in the Caribbean areas and Botswana and a glossary are presented in sections 7 and 8. A second volume contains all the materials to be used when conducting a survey, including drafts of covering letters and reminder letters, notes and definitions, questionnaires, and summary sheets for compiling survey data.

        "description":"Mail surveys designed to determine the current status of end user online searching were sent to three populations: 473 faculty members in 12 departments at 20 universities, online search coordinators in 89 academic libraries, and 15 library school educators. Direct interviews with 10 university faculty members were also conducted. Faculty were surveyed with respect to access to computing resources, familiarity with online searching, and information sources supporting teaching and research needs. Online coordinators were surveyed to identify existing and proposed library-based programs for educating end users. Library science faculty were asked to assess the impact of end user searching on libraries and library school curricula. Direct interviews with faculty who were occasional  online users dealt with an evaluation of online searching as an information support for teaching and research. Faculty results indicated a high level of familiarity with online searching but only a moderate level of end user searching. Low level of searching was attributed to lack of computing resources, familiarity with only limited systems, lack of funding, and lack of perceived need. The survey of online coordinators identified several existing or proposed library programs for educating users. The overall reaction of library educators was that library schools are attempting to prepare future librarians to work with a computer-literate end-user population interested in acquiring information directly. All of the faculty members interviewed endorsed the concept of end user searching, but  most professed reluctance to do their own searching. It was concluded that a vacuum still exists between the potentially useful resources of academic libraries and the information needs of potential user groups. (Author/THC)",

Questionnaires were returned by 152 coordinators for a response rate of 71%. The study focused on the use of various tools in the selection and ordering of ILL photocopies (e.g., union lists, the OCLC ILL subsystem, and the OCLC Name-Address Directory); the nature and amount of ILL activity of these institutions; and the factor of cost in the ordering and the supplying of ILL photocopies. The reactions of ILL personnel concerning possible participation by their libraries in proposed cooperative ILL photocopy cost containment programs were also solicited, as well as their  attitudes toward the role of the library association in fostering ILL cost containment programs.

        "description":"Community colleges have been at the forefront in providing contract training programs for clients such as businesses, health care organizations, and government agencies. Many state governments are beginning to provide resources for these programs as an incentive to attract or retain business and industry. One of the consequences of the demand for and growth of contract training programs has been a heightened interest in creating special centers to market and deliver these programs. The advantages of creating separate centers include the enhanced image and public relations value of having a specialized organizational unit; their income-generating potential; and the provision of new opportunities for faculty to broaden their experience. Unfortunately, the rapid growth of contract  training centers may also lead to some significant problems (e.g., lack of instructors qualified to competently and professionally represent the college, inability of the college to provide materials and facilities that meet corporate expectations, and staff resistance). To maximize benefits and minimize problems, institutions interested in establishing such centers should consider the following issues: (1) college staff must carefully analyze the role and goals of a center for contract training; (2) there is a need to develop separate advisory structures for representatives from businesses and the college; (3) center staff should have a strong business background; and (4) the college needs to develop policies regarding center profits and retained earnings.

        "description":"Five major issues are currently confronting community colleges. The first issue relates to the need for a new measure of institutional functioning based on curriculum content (which is poorly represented by traditional program labels such as transfer or occupational programs) and student intent (which is rarely reflected by either program labels or students' own course-taking patterns). The second issue is concerned with managing access to a community college education in light of the trend in state after state toward limiting enrollments. Community colleges will be forced to make clearer distinctions among the student groups they serve, tightening attendance criteria and mandating entrance and placement testing. The third issue is the matter of student flow in community  colleges. Community colleges operate in a context of public expectations of linear progress from entry to degree attainment, yet this pattern is atypical of community college student flow. The fourth issue, maintaining a comprehensive curriculum, relates to the other three. From their inception, community colleges have offered baccalaureate studies, occupational programs, continuing education, general education, and remedial education. Current funding priorities place transfer and occupational education in primary positions, with remedial education following in terms of funding and support. The last major issue is the aging faculty and the problems of maintaining a qualified body of instructors to staff the colleges. (RO)",

        "description":"A 5-year longitudinal study was conducted in Illinois to follow 9,757 of the 10,273 students transferring from two-year colleges to senior colleges and universities in Illinois in fall 1979. The study sought to identify the number and mobility patterns of Illinois two-year college students; to investigate the pre-transfer characteristics of these students; to determine the level of persistence, baccalaureate completion, and performance after transfer; to determine the predictive validity of two-year college grades for senior institution success; and to analyze the relationship between post-transfer achievement and pre-transfer characteristics. Study findings included the following: (1) 31% of the transfer students in the study had earned an Associate in Arts or Associate in  Science degree prior to transfer; 7% had earned an Associate in Applied Science degree; and 62% transferred without completing an associate degree; (2) persistence rates and grade point averages (GPA's) tended to increase as the number of two-year college credits transferred increased; (3) 56% of the transfers had earned fewer than 60 semester credit hours at the two-year college from which they transferred; (4) senior college persistence rates and GPA's were higher for students with higher pre-transfer GPA's; (5) there was a significant positive correlation between pre- and post-transfer GPA's regardless of program of study or receiving institution; and (6) students coming from community college pre-transfer agriculture, business, engineering, and communications programs had the highest  persistence rates, while students coming from pre-transfer education, arts and humanities, and science and math programs had the highest senior college GPA's.

The study involved an analysis of public records related to enrollment, staffing, and finances; an extensive study, including on-site interviews, of 12 representative institutions; a survey of all 58 community colleges for information on mission, special constituencies, staffing, funding, developmental priorities, enrollment trends, and transfer agreements; a survey of student interest in and use of special services and facilities; interviews with selected state-level and institutional administrations; and focus group interviews with students and community members. Study findings included the  following: (1) staffing patterns varied considerably as a function of institutional size, student and staffing markets, and local variations in assignment of personnel allocations; (2) full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment was found to be the most generally appropriate basis for allocating operating funds to the institutions in terms of its capability to reflect the instructional staff workload; (3) the tradition of local control through the institutional boards appeared to be working well and in accordance with current statutes and regulations; (4) the state's community colleges were perceived by community members and prospective students as of higher educational status than the technical colleges or technical institutes; and (5) increases in college transfer tuition to the lowest of the  current four University System tuition rates would result in an increase in tuition of about 129% for the community college students involved. The study generated 29 recommendations regarding areas including budget allocation formulas, research needs, administrative structures, conversion of technical colleges to community colleges, and tuition increases.

        "description":"In 1985-86, Kalamazoo College participated in a project to promote student transfer from two-year colleges. Among the accomplishments of the project were the preparation of a general transfer student brochure addressing issues of admissions, financial aid, credit transfer, and academic advising; the distribution of a quick reference sheet stating transfer and credit policies to all admissions counselors at Kalamazoo Valley Community College; the development of a special application for transfer admission; the institution of a new policy whereby transfer applicants receive information on degree requirements and a written evaluation of their transcripts; and the establishment of closer contacts between Kalamazoo College's Transfer Coordinator and local community colleges. Other  projects, currently in progress, include research on the educational backgrounds of transfer students and the development of a special transfer student orientation program. Several characteristics of Kalamazoo College have limited its ability to enroll large numbers of two-year college transfer students, including its selective admissions policies, the high costs of attending the college, its unique school calendar, and the negative attitude held by some members of the faculty and administrative staff regarding transfer students. On the other hand, features such as the small size of the college, its fine academic reputation, its system of academic advising, and full presidential support have facilitated Kalamazoo's efforts to recruit two-year college transfer students.

        "description":"In light of the increasing enrollment of part-time students at public two-year colleges, the question arises whether the conventional ratio (3:1 or so) for converting part-time to full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment accurately represents the actual costs of providing services to part-time versus full-time students. A study was conducted to assess the relative effect of part-time versus full-time students on several types of expenditures in the two-year college. Using a translog model, costs were represented by reported expenditures; output by the number of full-time, part-time, and non-credit students; prices by average salaries for full-time faculty; and technological conditions by program emphasis, the percent of students earning a degree, and the system status of the  institution. The study found that: (1) the marginal costs for instruction at small colleges were estimated to be $1335 for a full-time student and $245 for a part-time student, while costs at large institutions were estimated to be $1941 for a full-time student and $194 for a part-time student; (2) regardless of institutional size, the ratio of full-time to part-time marginal costs was greater in the instructional area than in student services; and (3) at the majority of the two-year colleges in the sample it cost only about one-fifth to one-seventh as much to provide instructional services for a part-time student as a full-time student. A five-page list of references and cost data for the 779 colleges in the study sample are appended. (EJV)",

Keyser calls for a concern with \"holistic leadership,\" that is, a synthesis of doing and defining and creating and anticipating. Next, in \"Building and Maintaining Trust,\" Keyser encourages student development  professionals to take the lead in managing trust, and suggests five trust-building strategies. \"The Deployment of Self,\" by Richard D. Rowray, stresses the importance of self-leadership and self-management, concluding from interviews with exemplary admissions and guidance services officers that outstanding leadership is accompanied by high levels of positive self-regard.

        "description":"The increased use of part-time faculty in community colleges has left in its wake a large literature on the problems posed by heavy reliance on part-time faculty and on the need to address these problems through staff development programs. Four approaches have been used by community colleges to deal with the staff development needs of their part-time faculty. The first approach is based on a curriculum development model, which is characterized as a set of in-service workshops and courses designed to complement the part-timer's subject expertise with activities to strengthen pedagogical skills and provide information about the community college. The second approach involves the formation of peer support networks through which part-timers share experiences and help each other with  problems encountered on the job. The third is a personnel management approach, whereby the college's recruitment, hiring, and evaluation policies are developed with improved instruction in mind. The fourth approach draws upon theories of adult education to involve part-timers in identifying and solving the problems they face on the job. This approach stresses the development of part-timers' awareness of work problems as a means of fostering receptiveness to staff development interventions. All of the approaches seek to instruct part-timers in pedagogical techniques and thus to improve instruction, and aim to integrate part-time faculty into the college community. (RO)",

        "description":"A study was conducted of shifts in student demand for programs offered by the Illinois community colleges, focusing on enrollment and completion patterns from fiscal years 1981 through 1984 by program area. Four indicators were used in the study. First, enrollments were analyzed by examining changes that had taken place in the fall opening headcount in various program areas. Second, enrollment patterns were analyzed in terms of changes in the number of credit hours taken in broad programmatic funding categories. Third, the number of students completing programs was examined to determine if shifts had occurred in the type of programs being completed. Fourth, the ratio of program completers to program enrollments was analyzed. Study findings included the following: (1) during the  4-year period, the enrollment in community colleges decreased, while the number of students completing programs increased; (2) the decline in enrollments during the last 2 years studied occurred in the areas of remedial/adult basic/adult secondary education and general education; (3) in the baccalaureate/transfer programs, all four measures of change in student demand indicated a growth trend; (4) while the overall demand for occupational programs also appeared to increase, the credit hours generated decreased; and (5) the occupational program area with the largest demand was business, followed by health and trade and industrial education.

        "description":"This paper examines major transfer education issues and proposes a comprehensive strategy for examining and improving transfer education. The first section explores ten major issues: (1) access to higher education for minorities and low socioeconomic status (SES) whites continues to be a problem; (2) over 50% of all entering community college students have goals related to attaining a baccalaureate; (3) students who complete 2 years in a community college may be expected to perform reasonably well at a senior institution; (4) no one educational sector can solve the transfer problem alone; (5) occupational students, especially those in allied health, engineering technology, data processing, agriculture, and forestry programs, transfer in sizeable numbers; (6) faculty/student  contact is one of the most important determinants of student retention; (7) giving students the right to fail simply has not worked; (8) literacy demands placed on community college students have decreased; (9) concerted efforts to address transfer education involving collaboration between two- and four-year colleges have achieved promising results; and (10) when community colleges fail to collect information and data, they lose out on a valuable opportunity to make modifications to improve their curricular and student support services. The next section describes a comprehensive transfer strategy, stressing that every constituency and educational sector must be involved in improving transfer education, and detailing the tasks to be undertaken by high schools, community colleges, senior  institutions, and state agencies in a cooperative and collaborative effort to ensure that the nation's minority and low SES students enjoy full access to higher education.

Topics discussed include fear of the bomb, fear of loss of family members, level of cognitive development and understanding of nuclear processes, and helping younger children cope. Adult defences against nuclear threat are pointed out prior to a discussion of the responses of adolescents and youth to nuclear threat. Specific attention is given to youth's changing attitudes toward nuclear threat, defending against anxiety, living without a sense of future, inability to identify with helpless role models, cynicism and learned helplessness, and the preemption of developmental tasks. Concluding remarks deal with the role of  the family as a supportive buffer protecting children from psychological damage by outside threats and, briefly, the role of the school in providing instruction concerning issues related to nuclear war.

During the 1984-85 academic year, the program was offered to 1,936 children who were four years old prior to September 1, 1984 and scored seven or fewer items correct on the Preschool Screening Evaluation (PSE). Most classes had 22 four-year-olds, one teacher, and one aide. In differentiated staffing, classes had two aides with one teacher, or two aides per classroom with one teacher supervising two or more classrooms. The curriculum focused on the development of skills in four areas: auditory, visual, motor, and language processes. Academic instruction was limited to approximately one hour per day and the  rest of the school day was devoted to large group activities, outdoor activities, and creative activities in art and music. Instructional groups were small, consisting of no more than five or six children. Support services were provided by early childhood education specialists. Upon completion of the school year, children were given the PSE to test the 10 objectives of the program. The mean pretest score was four and the mean posttest score was nine, indicating students attained 90% of program objectives. (HOD)",

Sixty-four children recruited from two day care centers in a small midwestern city searched for a lost object on two occasions. On the first occasion, half of the children searched a three dimensional table-top model for a missing item after watching a sequence in which a puppet lost the item. The other children searched under naturalistic conditions, looking in a familiar environment for an object that had been lost while they put away some toys. Half the children were questioned about their search behaviors, after which all  children participated in the second search task--a table-top search. In the first task, more searches took place in locations bounded by the last place the object was seen and the first place in which it was discovered missing if children searched in the naturalistic rather than the table top condition. In the second task, children searched the &quot;critical area&quot; more often if they were queried about their search behavior in the first task or if they searched intially in the naturalistic task. The results are discussed in terms of factors affecting the development of problem-solving competence. Three pages of references and tables of data are included. (DR)",

Health regulations for day care have not been researched in the day care setting per se but have been imposed on day care by the medical community working from a hospital model. Day care research has presumed that having antecedent health regulations in place would control the outcome of a good health program. Taken altogether, research has failed to uncover the source of the day care health problem or to offer solutions because it has concentrated on the structural variables of health component regulations and has ignored the functional variables of daily interpersonal and environmental transactions in day care centers. This dilemma can be resolved by applying to the evaluation of the  health component of day care the qualitative and quantitative methodologies developed to study the functional variables of socioemotional and cognitive development. (Appended are charts depicting inadequate through excellent programmatic responses to several health component variables, as well as tables that elaborate a framework for studying several functional/transactional variables and that specify research methodologies particularly apt for studying health transactions from the separate perspectives of staff, parents, and children.

Early education has come to serve many purposes but, as it expands, there is danger that the particular needs of young children will be overlooked by both professionals and parents. This essay underlines the vulnerability of young children and calls attention to the lifelong consequences of preschool experiences. Examining issues concerning the long term effects of preschool experiences, the discussion suggests that the value of early education will vary as a function of a matrix of factors including program quality, the vulnerability of individual children, and family needs. Additionally, the achievements and limitations of evaluation research are described  within the context of possible deleterious effects of preschool education. Emphasis is given to the importance of developing ideographic methods of study to achieve more valid assessments of children's response to early education. It is suggested that more time be devoted to understanding the effects of substitute child care on parental attitudes and behavior and to delineating and documenting the damaging consequences of poorly run early childhood programs.

Experimental subjects participated in 30 game-like safety lessons over a 2-month period. The curriculum emphasized concrete educational experiences to help the children establish cause and effect connections between safe practices and fire, water, and hazardous materials that youngsters might ingest. The activities were presented within the context of the regular preschool program at times and locations of  the teachers' choice. Pretests and posttests were conducted according to the Solomon research design. Analysis of variance of posttest scores resulted in very significant differences among groups, later confirmed by a &quot;t&quot; test between gain scores of the 2 pretested groups. Results of the evaluation indicate that, by participating in SAFE-AT-HOME, children at the preschool level were more aware of safety measures than children who did not participate. (DR)",

Discussion centers around the value of positive physical interactions to communication, to the child's emotional and social maturation, and to the establishment of a healthy teacher/learner relationship.

At a minimum, the Livian Wars Task required the use of various formal operations to successfully answer questions about a fictitious war between two neighboring countries. The task emphasized the relativity of thought necessary to  adequately understand a complex social interaction (war) between two groups of people. The results indicated only weak evidence for changes in formal operations across ages and education, but social-cognition was affected by age and education. Social-cognition and formal operations were not related. (HOD)",

        "description":"Aided by a 21-member Elementary Education Study Group, the Secretary of Education has prepared the first comprehensive report on elementary education in the United States in more than three decades. The report finds America's elementary schools in pretty good shape, and states that they do their job especially well in the early grades, only beginning to falter around the fourth grade. The report provides a detailed discussion of the current condition of elementary education in the United States and makes specific recommendations about how the elementary school can be improved through state and local initiatives. The discussion identifies the characteristics, habits, curricula, and spirit that constitute better schools, regardless of geographic setting or socioeconomic conditions.  Asserting that the best way to improve elementary education is to improve parent-school relationships and to support parents' efforts to teach their children, Chapter I discusses characteristics of children in modern society, and the roles and responsibilities of parents, schools, and the community in strengthening elementary education. Chapter II makes specific recommendations for establishing a common elementary curriculum for all students. Particular attention is given to reading, writing, mathematics, science, social studies, the arts, foreign languages, health and physical education, computers, and libraries. Advocating the deregulation of the principalship and the need for teacher professionalism, Chapter III discusses the principal's role as instructional leader and the  empowerment, preparation, and certification of teachers. Chapter IV sets out school policy issues for school boards, superintendents, and state legislators to consider, including academic standards for all children to meet, financial support for elementary schools, student discipline, drugs, class size, the role of parents in educating preschool-age children, kindergarten, special education, gifted children, textbooks, and language-minority children. Chapter V provides several vignettes of innovative elementary school programs and reiterates the need for excellence in elementary schools. A Department of Education news release (dated September 2, 1986) and an address by Secretary Bennett to the National Press Club on the same day, both pertaining to &quot;First Lessons,&quot; have been appended to  the report.

        "description":"Written in the social context of the United States in the 1980s and based on information about Hispanic students, parents, teachers, and schools contained in the national High School and Beyond data set, this book addresses critical issues regarding the status of Hispanic education of interest to Hispanics, policymakers, and academicians. Part I offers a brief historical review and describes the data set. Part II considers the cultural deprivation perspective, focusing on high-achieving Hispanic language minority students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The two chapters in this part question whether it is necessary to strip Hispanic disadvantaged students of their language and cultural identity in order to promote academic achievement and examine the assertion that Hispanic  parents have low educational aspirations for their children and do not exhibit interest in and/or encouragement of their children's education. Part III probes issues relating to the structural perspective: characteristics of high density ethnic minority barrio schools and bias on the part of both Anglo and Hispanic teachers toward Hispanic students. Part IV examines issues emerging in the early 1980s: impact of language of instruction on educational achievement; whether language minority background or low socioeconomic status is more important in explaining Hispanic educational attainment; and consequences of cutbacks in financial aid programs on the college-going behavior of Hispanic students. Part V contains a concluding chapter drawing together the implications of the study.  (NEC)",

        "description":"At the request of the North Carolina School Boards Association, a nationally recognized expert on school and school district consolidation evaluated the 1986 North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (DPI) plan for school district consolidation from the perspective of economic, educational, and social/political considerations, including the issues of fiscal and racial equality. Findings indicated (1) that the DPI failed to demonstrate that mergers will advocate any compelling state interest; (2) there is no solid foundation for the belief that elimination of school districts will improve education, enhance cost-effectiveness, or promote greater equality; and , (3) except for extraordinary circumstances, district reorganization should remain a voluntary decision of local  voters and school boards. The report makes the following major points/suggestions: (1) complex, far-reaching merger decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis; (2) since good schools/school districts come in all shapes and sizes, educational policies relying on rigid size/organization criteria are likely to have counterproductive effects; (3) since mandatory mergers will not advance any compelling state interest, &quot;back door&quot; consolidation approaches should be discontinued; (4) alternatives to consolidation can expand educational opportunities and enhance cost-effectiveness; and (5) issues like mergers usually are a diversion from the greater tasks of finding new ways to positively influence children's lives and increase teacher effectiveness.

        "description":"Analysis of census data indicates major population, industrial, and occupational changes occurred in many of Texas' 254 counties from 1960 to 1980. While 103 counties experienced rapid population growth by both natural and migration, patterns of change were dissimilar. Population grew steadily in metropolitan counties over the two decades. Counties contiguous to metropolitan areas generally experienced consistent growth, while others grew primarily in the 1970's, or continued to lose population, thus supporting the &quot;population turn-around.&quot; Absolute numbers of employed workers increased for metropolitan and decreased for urban- and rural-nonmetropolitan counties from 1960-1970, but from 1970-1980, increases were observed for all three county types (53.5%, 51.0%, and 38.8%,  respectively.) Over the period, decreases in employment occurred for operative and farmer/farm worker occupations, while professional/technical/kindred, manager/administrator, and sales and clerical occupational employment increased. Farmer/farm workers decreased 54.1% in metropolitan counties, 64.2% in urban-nonmetropolitan counties, and 57% in rural-nonmetropolitan counties. The largest increase in occupational structure was for the sales category, up 35.1% in metropolitan counties, 61.2% in urban-nonmetropolitan counties, and 93.6% in rural-nonmetropolitan counties. These changes suggest the gradual evolution from agrarian dependent to multi-dimensional occupation structures associated with increased industrial diversification.

The report is limited to evaluating achievement gains in basic skills; this is, however, acknowledged as only one facet of a comprehensive migrant program evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches found in annual migrant evaluation reports for the 1981-82 and 1982-83 schools years are discussesd. Guidelines for developing a state plan include building a program profile of instructional services offered to migrant students, setting priorities for evaluation, and selecting or developing evaluation strategies in relation to the priorities. The report outlines elements of a program profile and  discusses four evaluation approaches--norm-referenced evaluation, pre-post-matched scores, post-test only, and state assessment programs. Purpose, design features, testing features, aggregation, strengths, limitations, conditions supporting use, and recent use are presented for each evaluation type and information is summarized in a table. An appendix provides instructions for using pretest scores to select Chapter 1 participants in a norm-referenced evaluation model. A sequence of eight steps for implementation is laid out in detail.

        "description":"Rural elementary school teachers were interviewed to determine their knowledge of student prejudices and how they encouraged acceptance of differences; students were interviewed to determine what prejudices were held. Eight rural teachers and 53 first, third, and fifth grade students in a small northern Rocky Mountain community with no racial, ethnic, or religious minority inhabitants were interviewed. Rural first graders were found to know many ethnic and racial stereotypes, perceived people different from themselves as foreigners, would prefer to play with Anglo American children, and teased about physical appearance and religion. Rural third and fifth graders could not define &quot;prejudice,&quot; learned their views from parents/relatives/friends and television, seemed uncomfortable  responding to questions about Blacks, and teased about skin color, families, and religious affiliation. Rural teachers took strong stands against classroom expressions of prejudice, but rarely confronted deeply held attitudes, stressed acceptance of differences, and would like to spend more time on citizenship but did not illustrate diversity in American society through teaching materials. Recommendations for addressing prejudice in the classroom included inservice/preservice exploration of personally held prejudices, teaching about discrimination, helping children examine treatment of people who are different, and introducing students to the spectrum of individual differences outside their local community.

However, with passage of the Rural Electrification Act in 1939, cheap electricity was brought to rural areas. After that, the use of wind machines dramatically declined. Recently, the rapid rise in fuel prices has led to a resurgence in the use of wind power, especially for producing electricity. This bulletin provides information on: (1) types of wind machines; (2) several applications of the mechanical and electrical power generated by wind machines; (3) storing of electricity produced by wind systems; (4) utility hook-ups; (5) sizing a system; and (6) economic considerations.

        "description":"The effectiveness of environmental simulations in developing students' awareness of environmental issues, whether perception of environmental relationships was affected by the simulations, and whether the use of microcomputers as the medium of instruction affected student attitudes towards computers were investigated in this study. Undergraduates (N=110) enrolled in an introductory natural resources course at the Ohio State University participated in the study. The treatment group used three microcomputer simulations that were incorporated into the course as individual learning modules while the control group worked with comparable workbook modules. Content presentation techniques were assessed through a knowledge subtest instrument and an Environmental Relationship Perception  Survey. A Computer Awareness Survey measured attitudes toward computer enjoyment, anxiety, and user efficiency. The knowledge subtest results were significantly higher for the treatment groups suggesting that computer simulations are more effective for factual recall. However, the lack of significant changes in responses to the Environmental Perception Survey indicated that use of microcomputer simulations may not produce marked results in terms of higher cognitive processes. There was little in the data from the Computer Awareness Survey which would support the idea that increased exposure to computers results in more favorable attitudes toward them.

The project, based on the belief that the teacher is the key to addressing the present crisis in science education, was funded by the National Science Foundation. The undertaking includes strands of computer application, teaching methodology, instructional materials developed, involvement of industrial scientists, and leadership development in science. The program primarily provided for the teachers: (1) a renewal and updating in the latest scientific breakthroughs; (2) involvement in an analysis of science education; and (3) leadership opportunities in conducting  in-service teacher workshops in science throughout the state. The workshops were devoted to the preparation of written materials for computer, demonstration, laboratory, and instructional use and were designed by the participants to aid other teachers in improving their science courses. The results were disseminated throughout the school districts of Illinois and beyond. (Author/ML)",

Information was gathered through questionnaires, interviews with students and with their mathematics teachers, classroom observations, and examination of academic files. Among the many variables examined, the only one that turned out to be correlated with both sex and academic choice was confidence in one's ability in mathematics: boys expressed more confidence than girls and students choosing a science program expressed more confidence than students making other choices. The results of this study are consistent with sex-related differences observed in  causal attributions of success in mathematics (by students as well as by teachers), and in classroom interactions (girls having fewer public interactions with their teacher). It was also observed that girls, but not boys, were facing a conflict between career and family plans. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The processes of photosynthesis and respiration are basic to the understanding of many other aspects and functions of biological systems. Because of their curricular significance, these processes served as the focal point in an investigation of student conceptions and instructional effectiveness. In this study, students in a college nonscience majors' biology course took tests designed to reveal their conceptions of respiration and photosynthesis before and after course instruction. Even though most students had taken at least one full year of biology, serious misconceptions persisted. Most students gave definitions of respiration, photosynthesis, and food which were markedly different from those generally accepted by biologists. These incorrect definitions were associated with  more fundamental misunderstandings about how plants and animals function. Most students could not explain how animal cells use either food or oxygen. They understood plants as vaguely analogous to animals, taking in food through their roots instead of mouths. Previous biology instruction seemed neither to improve student performance on the pretest nor to prepare them to master these conceptions during the course. Course instruction was more successful, but misconceptions persisted for many students. These results raise fundamental questions about the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction in current high school and college biology courses. (Author/ML)",

Researchers administered diagnostic tests about light, vision, and color before and after instruction to 227 fifth-grade students over a 2-year period. They also conducted 11 clinical interviews. The tests and interviews revealed that almost all students shared certain misconceptions about light and its role in vision. In particular, most students believed that their eyes perceived objects directly rather than detecting light reflected by those objects. Most students also viewed color as a property of objects, not of light reflected by those objects. When teachers used conventional textbook-based methods of instruction, only a few students were successful in changing these misconceptions. Most students, however,  successfully mastered the scientific conceptions when teachers used materials specifically designed to help students overcome their misconceptions. (Author/ML)",

The structure of interdependence is defined as the relationship of competition or cooperation between players and the criteria for successful attainment of game goals as defined by pre-established rules. Subjects for the study were 64 second and third grade students at two public elementary schools in Geneva, Switzerland. A two-way analysis of variance was used on grade crossed with game version as measured by percent of interactions, percent of mutual monitoring and control, adequacy of decomposition strategy, and percent of errors. For percent of interaction, all three effects--grade, game version and their  interaction--were significant. For monitoring and control, all were non-significant. For decomposition strategy, game was significant and for errors, game version was significant. Quantitative indicators of congruence of playing behavior with game rules, monitoring and control, and decomposition were examined by regression analysis. Quantitative and qualitative measures were used to identify player profiles for both versions of the game. These player profiles did not appear to have a systematic impact on game outcome. (JM)",
