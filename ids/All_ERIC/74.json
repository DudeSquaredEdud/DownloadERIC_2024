        "description":"The Adolescent Worker Study was designed to provide an in-depth analysis of the job experiences and related life histories of out-of-school working youth. To do this, a team of investigators first identified work sites across a range of industrial sectors that were currently engaged in hiring young workers between the ages of 17 and 21. Then, the team engaged the participation of the next young person to be hired in each work site. As a result, 25 case histories were compiled and analyzed. The case studies of youth in work settings provide an anthology of the meaning of work for adolescents employed in organizationally and technologically diverse work settings. The research has uncovered the nature of workplace processes affecting all young workers' job experience and future  mobility, namely, finding a job, combating negative attributions, fitting into a job, receiving training, negotiating authority, and quitting or losing a job. Although it is difficult to generalize, the research indicates that accounts of the transition to work by out-of-school, noncollege-educated youth must consider at least these six processes. All young people entering jobs can benefit by understanding that these six dimensions of job-related experiences are likely to become issues at some point in their work lives. (KC)",

        "author":["Crandall, Jo Ann"],
        "description":"The United States has a large and rapidly growing population of limited English-proficient (LEP) students and adults. This population presents a distinct challenge to vocational educators. Some insights learned during the past decade suggest beneficial approaches to this problem. Four trends in current second-language acquisition research and language teaching are particularly relevant to the delivery of vocational education to LEP persons. These trends are the development of competency-based, functional, and task-oriented language learning programs; the increasing specialization of language instruction and the concomitant combining of English and content-area instruction; the distinction between communicative and cognitive language skills; and the development of a theory of  language that maximizes meaningful input as its basis. A great deal has also been learned during the past few years about refugee and immigrant education programs, namely, that language needs, cultural orientation needs, other educational needs, support services needs, and vocational training needs must be met. In addition, insights have come from bilingual vocational training and instructor training programs, such as program models, bilingual program components, strategies for vocational instruction of LEP students, and coordinated vocational and English-language instruction. However, much more needs to be done in the future. Areas that need further investigation include individual assessment and program evaluation, development of vocational materials and vocational language materials in  English and the native language, revision of licensing and certification procedures, and creation of programs to meet the needs of the least and most educated LEP students.

Planners identified several formal and informal means used to collect information to evaluate economic, industrial, and occupational trends. Information collection was conducted in five categories: publications, advisory councils (private sector), personal contacts and experience in industry, other personal contacts, and local research. When asked how the information affects program planning, respondents most frequently cited as an example the impact of office automation, which caused them to integrate the use of microcomputers and word processing into the business and office cluster. Respondents offered concrete examples for improving information and  making it more useful to them. The three areas targeted for improvement were upgrading the collection, presentation, and dissemination of data; sharing curriculum information; and collaborating more closely with industry.

        "description":"Between-group designs constitute the experimental methods traditionally applied in the field of education. Another level of analysis, however, is commonly used in clinical psychology but seldom applied in educational settings: single-subject designs (actually applied to small groups). This design allows a researcher to evaluate the influence of an educational or clinical procedure on a subject's performance by replicating its effect with the same individual over time. One type of single-subject design, the multiple-baseline design, is becoming more popular in educational studies. In the multiple-baseline design, measures are made simultaneously on two or more behaviors, subjects, or settings in order to identify a pre-treatment (baseline) level. The baseline data describe the  current level of performance and predict future performance. If each baseline changes when the intervention is introducted, the effects can be attributed to the intervention. Advantages of multiple-baseline designs include the following: (1) the multiple-baseline designs are effective means of evaluating educational procedures since they allow continuous monitoring (2) intervention is applied to only one or two baselines at a time; (3) large numbers of subjects are not needed; (4) the gradual application of the intervention permits the researcher to test its effectiveness on a small scale and make needed modifications; and (5) establishing a causal relationship does not require the withdrawal of treatment. Multiple-baseline designs may be appropriate for researching a variety of  educational questions, such as evaluation of adult literacy programs. (KC)",

        "description":"In an effort to identify the kinds of vocational experiences that appear to be the most promising in reducing the dropout rate, two distinct research strategies were used. The first strategy involved analysis of data available from the High School and Beyond Project, a nationally representative sample of students and schools surveyed in 1980 (when the students were sophomores) and resurveyed in 1982. The second strategy involved contacting a sample of nine exemplary dropout prevention programs and securing descriptive data from them regarding their orientation, organization, and operations. In general, project results confirm that participation in vocational education is positively related to high school retention. Rather than participate in the mainstream of the vocational  program, however, dropouts tend to participate more in exploratory and consumer/homemaker or industrial arts courses than in job-skill training courses. Also, they tend to be involved in work-study experiences that do not appear to be directly related to their overall high school programs. Included among the project recommendations are the following: more systematic efforts to identify potential dropouts; programmatic activities to reduce absenteeism, theft, and drug abuse; activities to enhance parents' involvement; more extensive career exploration and career education experiences; and review of dropout-prone students' work-study experiences.

        "description":"This guidebook is designed to assist high schools and 2-year postsecondary institutions in planning, implementing, and operating occupational program articulation efforts. Chapter 1 presents a retrospective of program articulation and a look at program articulation today, including time-shortened programs, advanced skills programs, and other forms of articulation. Chapter 2 provides profiles of 18 articulation study sites (including contact information, purpose, type of articulation, overview, and distinctive features). Chapter 3 takes a close look at 10 articulation principles for practitioners. Examples from the study sites illustrate the principles. Action steps for articulation are listed to help educators apply these principles in their own settings. Chapter 4 examines the  basic factors in planning and implementing a successful program and suggests creative ways for avoiding or resolving problems.

The materials contained in this manual are designed to help direct the school psychologist to other support services in the school and community. The role of the school psychologist in confronting crises is explained, problems facing children and adolescents are examined, and suggestions for interventions by psychologists are given. Assessment issues in crisis interventions are discussed and physical, emotional, and behavioral signs of crisis are listed. Physical and behavioral indicators of various types of child abuse and neglect are also listed. Several structured assessment interview formats that may be useful in assessing a  child in a crisis situation are explained and instruments developed to assess family stress are discussed. School psychological services to children in crisis are reviewed with discussions centering on instances in which children were referred to psychologists for immediate action. Crisis situations are described in the areas of sexual abuse, suicide and suicide threats, psychosomatic complaints, and family problems. The technique of life space interviewing is described and steps in the interviewing process are given. Crisis management in rural areas is considered. The handbook concludes with an annotated list of additional resources for the school psychologist, an extensive reference list, and appendices which contain information on incest, sexual abuse, and the life space interview.

The analysis provides the following conclusions: (1) older women are more likely to be poor, widowed, and living alone than are older men; (3) labor force participation and median income decline with age; (4) only the oldest old (85 and older) live in old age homes in significant numbers; (5) with increasing age householders are increasingly likely to rent housing and to live alone; (6) older Americans spend a relatively high percentage of their income for housing; and (7) poverty rates for the elderly are lower than for the population as a whole. A statement by Senator John Heinz describes four implications of the  analysis to be important to policy makers: significant subgroups of elderly do not have equity in their homes; housing expenses can be a burden for some older Americans, costing up to half of their incomes; many older persons do not have telephones; and subgroups of elderly differ greatly in economic well-being. Heinz's statement also noted the need for housing policy appropriate for the graying of America. Tables and figures of census data are included.

Opening statements are presented from committee members Matthew J. Rinaldo, William J. Hughes, Christopher H. Smith, and Dan Mica. Four panels of witnesses testify: (1) two elderly victims of violent crime; (2) federal, state, and local law enforcement officials; (3) a detective specializing in crime prevention and a city police chief; and (4) elderly advocacy representatives. Witnesses provide testimony that elderly people have special difficulties recovering from the physical, economic, and psychological ills of crime because they have fewer resources upon which to fall back. The crime prevention officer reports fear of crime to be one of the greatest  burdens crime creates for the elderly. Law enforcement officials testify that crime rates are decreasing and elderly people have a lower victimization rate than do younger people. The impacts of tougher crime control legislation and victim compensation are discussed. Elderly advocates call for increases in police presence, citizen watch activity, punishment of criminals, numbers of police, and federal funding for older citizens' needs.

        "description":"Although some researchers have distinguished the concepts of pain and suffering and despite the recent rise of many centers for pain management in the United States, medical educators and practitioners have given little attention to the topic of suffering. In the studies which have been conducted, patients differed in styles of coping with and interpreting the pain experience. A review of the literature identified 11 attitudes and corresponding subscales which could be used to investigate attitudinal differences between men and women and between lay and religious people among retirees. A 99-item questionnaire was administered to 80 retirees (mean age=73.4): 20 lay men, 20 lay women, 20 religious men, and 20 religious women. The results indicated that lay people tended to have  stronger attitudes than religious people and men seemed to have stronger attitudes than women, Tukey's studentized range test revealed that the lay group had a stronger bad-luck attitude, a stronger defensive attitude, and a weaker redemptive attitude than did the religious group. It also showed that men had a stronger laws-of-nature attitude than did women. The results suggest that individuals draw upon a variety of attitudes when faced with an interpretation of pain. (TW)",

        "description":"Recent research has refuted the behaviorist approach by establishing a relationship between emotion and behavior. The data collection procedure, however, has often involved an inferred emotional state from a hypothetical situation. As partial fulfillment of a class requirement, 60 college students were asked to perform two problem solving tasks from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. Ten emotions were assessed by self-report on a 9-point scale. Subjects were asked before the tasks how well they though they would do and how much they would like it. Following the tasks the students were again asked in retrospect how well they thought they did and how much they liked the task. To assess the changes, pre-task scores were subtracted from the post-task scores. The results  revealed that changes in emotional state from before to after the task were related to the subject's motivation toward the task. Altering the emotions of the subjects while engaged in problem solving altered the relationship between emotion and motivation. It was also found that motivation toward one type of problem solving could predict motivation toward other similar types. The self-report scales of emotions greatly enhanced the ability to predict. This relationship between motivation and emotional state can have an impact of the teaching of problem solving to children. (TW)",

The goals of the program are to improve the students' college experiences and raise retention rates. Targeted students are low-income, educationally or culturally disadvantaged, or from five minority ethnic groups, who have had poorer academic performance and retention rates than traditional students in the past. Because of affirmative action programs at UCSD, greater numbers of these high-risk students are enrolling. Summer Bridge is a 4-week summer residential program designed to improve students' academic performance and to integrate them into university life.  The academic components of the program include writing, math, and science skills. Time management and communication skills sessions are also held. The peer network available to students is strongly emphasized and support services continue throughout the academic year. Retention rates for Bridge students through graduation have dramatically improved to equal the university-wide rate and Bridge students have become campus leaders. (ABL)",

Peer counselors are used at the University of California, San Diego in the Academic Success Program. The targeted students to be helped are from economically or socially disadvantaged backgrounds and/or minority groups. This program was designed to ensure high-risk students success and retention rates. Trained student paraprofessionals (peer counselors) facilitate other students' success. Training is provided to potential peer counselors in a course entitled \"The Psychology of Teaching\". The class includes skills development, formation of counseling skills, conflict management, establishing relationships, and sensitivity to issues of ethnic students. A practicum component involves role playing  and skill practice. Selection of counselors is based on maturity, communication skills, and understanding of the program's goals and commitment. Once selected, counselors receive further training in intervention skills, cardiopulmonary resusitation, team building, campus services, and program goals. Peer counselors help students with academic choices, financial aid, work-study opportunities, and housing clients. Academic progress is monitored and academic support is arranged when needed. Difficult problems are referred to the coordinator. Client students appreciate the help and peer counselors experience personal growth. (ABL)",

        "description":"This document contains testimony and prepared statements from a Congressional hearing called to examine the issue of elder abuse. Chairman Claude Pepper's opening statement discusses the horror of elder abuse and calls for federal legislation, similar to the child abuse legislation, for combating elder abuse. Elder abuse is defined as physical abuse, sexual assault, forceable restraint, isolation, exploitation of money or property, neglect, or failure to provide for physical or health needs of the elderly. Three panels of witnesses testify. The first panel includes three victims of elder abuse and Suzanne K. Steinmetz, an advocate for the elderly. Steinmetz testifies that the frail elderly are often being cared for by their aged children without social support, placing these  elderly at risk of abuse. The second panel includes a former finance officer from an old soldier's home who testifies about embezzling money from her elderly clients and an attorney who testifies about the financial exploitation of the elderly. The third panel consists of representatives from Florida, Ohio, Alabama, California, and Arizona giving their states' perspectives. The appendix includes a staff report from Pepper's office which draws the following conclusions: (1) elder abuse is increasing and is reported less than is child abuse; (2) three-quarters of the states have adult protective service laws for mandatory reporting of elder abuse; and (3) states need funding for this new social service area. A survey of the states' human service departments' elder abuse policies is  included. Specific federal policy recommendations are made. (ABL)",

Opening statements from the chairman and three members of the Select Committee on Aging focus on the financial burden of long-term care for America's elderly, the anticipated growth of an aging population, and the need for alternatives to high-cost institutional care. Testimony is given from witnesses including the chairman and members of the Close-Up Foundation in Arkansas, the chairman of the Arizona Governor's Advisory Council on Aging, a staff member of the Oregon Governor's Ombudsman's Program, Utah's state director of the American Association of Retired Persons, the chairman of the Rural Elderly Task  Force for the Select Committee on Aging, and several retirees. The needs of the elderly, especially for in-home medical and social services from the community are stressed. Suggestions are offered for federal support of long-term care, including: (1) federal incentives to insurance companies for long-term care; (2) extension of Medicare to cover long-term care; (3) incentives to keep people in their own homes and out of institutions through federally supported programs or extension of existing federal programs; (4) the use of tax credits to help relieve the financial burden on families of the elderly; and (5) the use of paramedicals to provide in-home care.

The effects of need for uniqueness and uniqueness relevant feedback on mood, recall, and perceptions of peers and the self were examined in 60 college students who participated in a two-part study. In part one of the study, subjects attempted to memorize 52 trait terms, completed a 30-item attitude survey, indicated how similar they felt their attitudes were to those of the average college student, and recalled as many of the 52 trait terms as possible. Subjects also indicated the extent to which each of the 52 traits applied to them personally and to the average college student, and completed the Need for Uniqueness Scale (NUS). At session two,  subjects attempted to memorize the 52 traits plus an additional 16 traits and considered the attitude survey completed in the first session. The survey now contained uniqueness relevant feedback on subjects' responses. Subjects then recalled and rated traits as in session one. NUS scores were used to classify subjects as high or low in need for uniqueness. The findings partially support the prediction that uniqueness-relevant feedback induces a negative affective state in recipients. The prediction that uniqueness-relevant feedback is more likely to cause modification in attributions of peers rather than in self-attributions also received some support. Further evidence that the NUS is valid was generated by the investigation. (NRB)",

To address these issues, a self-report inventory using a modified paired comparison format was developed to assess need potencies within individuals. The inventory, based on Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs, permits both multiple comparisons of items from each need level with each other and an assessment of the intensity levels of each item. College students (N=47) and faculty members (N=12) responded in percentages to choices between paired items in the area of physical, safety, belongingness and love, esteem, and self-actualization needs. The reliability  of the inventory was evaluated by examining the degree of consistency of items designed to measure the same need. Correlations ranged between .52 and .65. The mean potencies of each need level were determined and an analysis of variance revealed that the differences between need levels were significant. Need level, as measured by the intraclass correlation, were significant and indicated that ideas at each level were measuring the same construct. (NRB)",

Besides street rape there is no consensus on the definition of rape. This study attempts to gather people's perceptions of rape. Subjects (N=96) were approached randomly and accepted if they fit into desired gender and socioeconomic group blocks. A questionnaire using semantic differential was given to participants who defined rape relative to other constructs in their semantic spaces. Four concepts (rape, seduction, assault, and making love) were used and grouped in different orders to avoid association bias. Participants were told that the survey was about a variety of topics and the construct rape was not mentioned. The results showed  that males viewed seduction and making love as similar, while females viewed seduction and assault as similar. Socioeconomic group did not have any effect except in interaction between gender and socioeconomic group on the assault-making love semantic space. Race and family type had no effects. Thirty percent of the male and 35 percent of the female respondents reported that they or someone they knew had a prior rape incident. For those reporting this prior experience, the gender effect was negated and males viewed assault and seduction as more similar to rape than to making love. Further rape research might utilize this important variable. (ABL)",

        "description":"A newer discipline called environmental psychology has begun to study the effects of noise, particularly on task performance and reactional behavior. In the 1970's college dormitories liberalized their living conditions; this led to fewer quiet hours. College students may not move off campus to find a quiet environment for studying. Dormitory students deal with the noise by studying elsewhere or drowning out outside noise with their own stereo or television. It was hypothesized that college students attempting to study under various audio environments would evaluate material and author less favorably and make more errors as their ability to control the environment decreased. Female subjects (N=64) volunteered. A dormitory situation was simulated with recorded noises: (1)  dormitory noise; (2) rock and roll music; (3) television; (4) bird sounds; and (5) silence. Subjects were given a psychology chapter to read. The participants rated their evaluations of the informativeness of the chapter, the quality of the writing, their liking of the chapter, and their liking of the author. Quiz performance was scored. The results showed that the dorm noise group scored significantly lower in all comparisons. Rock and roll and television noise did not affect comparisons. This research might point out the need for dormitories to be quiet in order to ensure quality of study. A floor plan of the simulated dorm used for the experiment is included. (ABL)",

Analyses revealed long-term program effectiveness in sustaining, above pretest levels, participant improvements in lifestyle habits and health information achieved at posttest and 6 months. The data, however, clearly showed these program benefits to have declined from the 6-month follow-up. Positive posttest and 6-month follow-up program effects related to mental health, responsibility for health, and risk to heart attack and stroke were not shown to have been sustained at long term. Health service utilization behavior and health status at long term also were not found to be significantly changed from pretest. Decreased involvement in health promotion classes and premature long-term evaluation may partially explain these results. (NRB)",

A study was undertaken to examine PTSD problems of former prisoners of war from World War II and Korea. Five variables are measured: (1) length of time as a prisoner of war (POW); (2) where prisoners were captured, since prisoners of Japan endured longer captivity, worse conditions, and more severe treatment than European POWs; (3) age; (4) rank; and (5) branch of service. A sample of POWs (N=172) from an ex-POW organization completed a questionnaire designed to assess  current occurrence of PTSD. Four percent reported never being troubled by PTSD symptoms and 25 percent reported always being bothered by these symptoms. Most of the remaining 71 percent had intermittent problems with PTSD. A noteworthy percentage had stable marriages with 88 percent married and a mean duration of current marriages of 35 years. However, these marriages may not denote emotional intimacy. Only age and rank at time of capture were significantly related to PTSD with lower ranking and younger veterans demonstrating greater current problems. The relationship between type of trauma and PTSD should be examined. References and the POW questionnaire are appended. (ABL)",

The research used as subjects five highly rated tournament chess players who &quot;thought aloud&quot; during a chess game to provide tape recorded protocols of decisions made while playing. These protocols were then analyzed phenomenologically in three steps. Results are presented for nine specific issues in which the phenomenological approach differs from computer simulation programs: the look ahead function, purposiveness, goal seeking, memory, overall sense of the task, level of knowing, role of experience, expectations, and opponent's style. The most significant general divergence between the two methods is noted as the computer's ability to  thematize millions of possible subsequent combinations of moves while a person can thematize only a few dozen possibilities. The paper concludes that, given the divergence between the two models, a descriptive method can be useful for the psychology of thinking. Results are followed by a list of references. (ABB)",

The screening tool contains 16 indicators which include the following: (1) the elderly person's feelings of fear, unwantedness, or depression; (2) the caretaker's alcohol abuse, financial dependence on the elderly person, lying, stressed condition, or misunderstanding of the elderly person's condition; (3) the elderly person has been threatened, hurt or his personal needs not met; (4) marital stress in the family; and (5) financial  stress in the family. Content validity, criterion related validity, and construct validity are examined and a reliability study is planned. This tool has advantages over other tools because it examines psychological and behavioral indicators rather than just demographic indicators. A need for further validation by the research community is noted. (The Hwalek-Sengstock Elder Abuse Screening Protocol is included.) (ABL)",

If suspected abuse is reported, the relationship between caregiver and patient may change and the family's difficulties may increase. Indicators of abuse are not easy to differentiate from health problems, especially in the frail elderly. An Elder Assessment Team was established at Beth Israel Hospital to develop a protocol to use in assessing potential abuse. The elder assessment instrument was developed to assess the following areas on a Likert scale: (1) general physical presentation; (2) physical condition; (3) usual life style; (4) social interactions; and (5) medical conditions. Following this protocol, clinicians judge whether they see evidence of abuse and a care team  of nurse, physician, and social worker assess and dispose of the case, filing a report with authorities if necessary. Staff awareness of elder abuse has been increased since the implementation of this protocol and staff seem more willing to report their suspicions to an internal group than to file a state agency report.

Not only is performance of the military member affected, but so is the emotional stability of the spouse and children. Three phases of emotion and behavior can be delineated in the sequence-reaction to the loss or change of separation: (1) protest; (2) despair; and (3) detachment. This sequence can lead to generalized anxiety and significant depressive symptoms. Adequate preparation for the stages of separation (the notification of separation, the actual departure, and the resulting difficulty of coping alone) will help the spouse adjust to the new roles and life style. The waiting spouse must also adapt to the new emotions and behaviors of  reunion when the military spouse returns. This final stage of separation adjustment, integration and reorganization, is made difficult by individual growth and change in the waiting spouse and other family members. Crisis intervention, prior preparation, and sustained support enable the waiting spouse to cope more effectively with all stages of separation. Family counseling, financial and legal counseling, education, support groups, individual counseling, and crisis hot lines can all contribute to the family's successful adjustment to the military members' separation and return.

Among the changes to be expected will be a shift of emphasis from a client specialty focus to a focus on life decisions and planning; from a traditional case load approach to a demand for high output and performance; and from a professional services orientation to a market forces orientation. In addition, credentials and training will give way to demonstrated high performance as the chief criterion for hiring. Marketing concepts can aid counselors in identifying the public's needs and desires for counseling services. Counselors should recognize the life cycles of their products and services and adapt accordingly. A number of forces are competing with counseling services today: self-help books,  self-help networks, other helping services entering the field and technologically-based services. Human services professionals should follow these recommendations: (1) use marketing strategies to locate potential users and to promote and assess services; (2) make effective use of new technology; (3) make a commitment to research and development; and (4) phase out ineffective services.

Two juvenile arsonists and their mothers testified about their experiences. Dean Clark, a  mental health professional, testified that many juvenile arsonists need extended inpatient therapy and Clifford Karchmer, a professor in the School of Justice at American University, testified that diagnostic tools are needed to separate the more serious juvenile arsonists from the less serious arsonists.

The concept of self-disclosure, the process of making the self known to other persons, has been associated with varying levels of well-being. The content and comprehensiveness of self-disclosure by the elderly to an adult child vis-a-vis self-disclosure to a friend was examined and the relationship between self-disclosure and well-being in the elderly was analyzed. A volunteer sample of 107 elderly persons from six New York City senior citizen centers completed Lohman's Life Satisfactiion Scale and a modified version of Moriwaki's Self Disclosure Questionnaire. Results showed that differences in content areas disclosed to an adult child and those  disclosed to a friend were significant. There was also a significant relationship between the content revealed to an adult child and well-being. Disclosure may have been listed secondary to other basic material needs since the group studied had a lower than average socioeconomic status. But the finding that different aspects of the self were disclosed in greater amounts to different individuals suggests that the elderly have a need for continued interaction with different network systems.

A study was conducted to examine the hypothesis that enhanced adjustment would be associated with particular demographic characteristics, the availability of emotional and physical support, and specific coping processes.

A biological questionnaire, the General Well-Being Schedule, Ways of Coping Checklist, and Acceptance of Disability Scale were used as assessment tools. Women who  had had more recent mastectomies reported more emotional support. The coping process of wishful thinking predicted poorer well-being and less disability acceptance. Seeking social support predicted poorer well-being. Wishful thinking and seeking social support were used more by younger women. Length of time since the mastectomy was found to be important both in psychological and physical healing, while the availability of emotional support was the strongest predictor of well-being.

The third section  provides the rationale for a computer assisted reading component in the composition program, while the fourth presents a number of activities designed to help readers read reflectively as authors, relating them to the various roles previously delineated.

The resulting data were used in a frequency of effects analysis. The frequency of effects problem arises once it has been established that an experimental manipulation has produced an effect, and consists of trying to determine the frequency and size of the effect. Text was displayed on a CRT and refreshed every three milliseconds (msec). The subjects' eyes were monitored during reading, with sampling of eye position every msec. During selected fixations, the letters at certain locations were replaced by other letters, thus resulting in erroneous letters being present at specific  retinal locations on those fixations. The eye movement data were then analyzed to determine whether errors produced an effect, and if they did, to estimate the frequency with which this occurred. Subjects were 12 college students, each of whom read 16 short passages, which yielded over 1,000 fixations in the control and two experimental conditions. The results indicated that in one instance, a manipulation that produced a 21-msec increase in fixation duration was actually producing a 151-msec increase in only 21% of the instances and was having no effect in the remaining 79% of the cases. The findings suggest that studies of eye movements in reading should use the frequency of effects analysis procedure to determine more accurately the effects of a given manipulation. (HTH)",

Specifically, the study explored (1) whether the ability to prioritize or structure information in texts was consonant with proficient reading, (2) whether the ability to prioritize information from texts was dependent upon the memory capacity and/or decoding ability of the reader, and (3) whether the ability to prioritize information that is read follows a developmental sequence. Subjects--75 third-grade and 62 fifth-grade students from two elementary schools identified as high, middle, or low reading achievers--read orally and silently an expository passage from an unfamiliar elementary social studies textbook. They then rated units within the text as of high, middle, or low  importance. Analysis of student scoring indicated that in both third and fifth grades the more proficient readers appear to have a greater ability to identify priority information in expository texts. Results suggest a developmental trend, because at every achievement level the performance of fifth graders was greater than that of third graders within the same achievement levels. The major implication of this study points to the need for children to be given aid and instruction in the identification of important pieces of information from texts. (EL)",

A prototypic program was developed and pilot-tested with 12 kindergarten children over a three-week period, with each child participating in three individual sessions a week for two weeks. In the third week, the computer was moved into the classrooms to evaluate the benefits that a speech-enhanced system might have on the communicative environment. During the project, three areas were identified in which the microcomputer made distinct contributions to the language experience program: (1) more efficient use of teacher time and materials, (2) increased  individualized and independent learning, and (3) increased student motivation. The pilot study confirmed that microcomputers with speech synthesizers can enhance the language experience approach to beginning reading. (Author/FL)",

Subjects included a group of 38 students who demonstrated incorrect prior knowledge of motion theory in two pretests. Students were provided with two types of texts. The refutation text consisted of information regarding certain principles of motion, but it discussed those ideas as being in contrast with students' intuitive ideas. The nonrefutation version described Newtonian mechanics but did not discuss any of the ideas as being in  contrast with commonly held misconceptions about motion theory. Posttest results revealed that the refutation text was more effective at getting students to change their prior misconceptions about the principles of motion. It did not make any difference if students were asked to activate their prior knowledge or not. In lieu of refutation text, it was recommended that teachers use an anticipation-reaction guide or George Posner's and others' four-step model of conceptual change instruction to dispel students' counter-intuitive notions.

Of interest were the possible interactions between individual difference measures (verbal and spatial ability) and map generation on comprehension and the relationship between information produced on individual maps and comprehension. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the &quot;Map group&quot; (who constructed a map while reading) or the &quot;Nomap&quot; group (a read-only condition). All subjects read a 773-word passage describing a mythical tribe's pilgrimage. Comprehension was assessed using an 18-item multiple-choice test containing literal, inferential, and  reconstruction items. Results demonstrated the differential effects of map construction on comprehension. Low verbal ability subjects were negatively influenced by map construction, particularly at the detail level, whereas for the high verbal ability subjects, comprehension was enhanced. The reconstruction and inferential results suggested different emphases in comprehension. Map construction enhanced performance on reconstruction questions but failed to facilitate text integration types of comprehension. (HOD)",

Subjects were 35 seventh grade students representing seven different achievement levels on the reading comprehension and vocabulary subtests of a standardized achievement test. The repertory grid technique devised by G. A. Kelly was used to elicit subjects' constructs about nine different types of reading materials (including advertisements, maps, and storybooks) that represented different purposes and comprehension levels and offered chances for subjects to construe both surface and deep level  structures. Significant differences were found on the number of deep level constructs among the low, middle, and high ability groups. Although high achievers used more deep level constructs that were elaborated and refined, they did not reduce their number of surface or low level constructs. Cluster patterns representing the organization of materials according to similarity of reading purposes were found in a moderate degree at the middle achievement levels; however, complexity cluster organization, construction, and integration were evident only in the highest level. The 10 content categories that emerged from the constructs were highly similar for all achievement levels. The report includes a five-page list of references. (FL)",

Specifically, the focus was on the development of an appropriate scaffold for teaching fifth and sixth grade students to use text structures effectively in comprehending social studies texts and to produce expository texts on social studies topics. Instruction about compare-contrast text structure was introduced to the 22 sixth grade students in the treatment group using a process writing approach. (The 23 sixth grade students in the control group were involved only in the posttesting.) The instructional program focused on teaching students to select the relevant information, add necessary background information, and impose  an appropriate organizational pattern from a workbook containing social studies texts consisting of compare/contrast passages, related questions, and compare/contrast charts. The three assessment tests created for pre- and posttests were free recall, multiple-source summarization, and writing production tasks. The results indicated that the instruction enhanced students' ability to both identify and organize expository writing, improved their performance in the free recall test, and improved their selection and organizing of information in the free writing test.

To determine if a global level of processing (pertaining to the whole text or to large sections of it) would affect eye movement patterns differently, a study examined the pattern of movements of skilled adult readers as they encountered stories with surprise endings. The subjects, 22 college students, read three surprise-ending stories while their eye movements were monitored. As a control condition, some students read versions of the stories that had been rewritten to give away the surprise at the beginning. Results showed an increase in the number of fixations associated with rereading the  surprising lines of the stories when compared to the same lines in the control condition versions. There was also a small increase in the mean duration of fixations on the surprising lines, but there was no change in mean saccade length. The findings suggest that even the most global levels of processing must be considered as an influence on the eye movement control system.

The seven major observation categories were (1) to whom assigned, (2) when assigned, (3) materials, (4) material focus, (5) instructions for learning, (6) student behavior, and (7) teacher behavior. All of the observed teachers used a basal reader and accompanying workbook in their reading instruction. The results indicated that half the teachers frequently gave the assignments to the whole class, suggesting that seatwork is essentially a management device to keep students quiet. They also assigned seatwork before the reading lesson, which may be to reinforce skills from a  previous lesson. Few teachers used written directions and none used an assignment sheet. Only six teachers provided students with the purposes for completing an activity, and only one teacher provided practice examples on a frequent basis. All of the teachers required students to work at seats by themselves, and only four teachers circulated around the room to assist students who had questions. In contradicting previous literature on assignment and supervision of reading seatwork, these results suggest that teachers need to provide students with meaningful purposes for the learning tasks, illustrate and practice the assigned task with them and supervise more closely their success with these tasks in order to make them effective.

The first chapter (1) provides an overview of the report; (2) summarizes recent achievements documented by the surveys, including improvements in reading made by Black, Hispanic and disadvantaged students; (3) lists areas in which more improvement is needed; and (4) cites other trends revealed by the data. The findings include: (1) the reading proficiency of males has trailed that of females in all four reading assessments; (2) the gaps between the regions of the country have narrowed considerably due primarily to improvements in the Southeastern  region (except for that region's 9-year-olds); (3) the influence of home environment is apparent in that students from homes with an abundance of reading materials are substantially better readers than those with few materials available and students whose parents have post-high school education read substantially better than those whose parents have not graduated from high school; (4) six or more hours of TV viewing per day is consistently and strongly related to lower reading proficiency; and (5) students who receive homework and do it tend to read better than students who do not have homework or do not do it. The major portion of the second chapter offers brief descriptions of the five levels of proficiency defined by the reading tasks used in the surveys and gives data showing the  number of students in each age group who attained each level. The third chapter examines the data to discover exactly who has been improving, providing figures for Black, Hispanic, and White students, for males and females, and for students in different types of communities and in different regions. The fourth chapter looks at influences on reading proficiency, including parents' level of education, reading materials in the home, the effects of television, and homework.

The intent was to use respondents' preferred source for state news as opposed to national news sources used by the Roper polling organization in their surveys of media preferences. Since the literature indicated that responses favored television as the preferred news source for national news, it was questioned whether state news would be perceived as being like local news in which previous responses favored newspapers. A second intent was to determine whether any change favoring television  would be more likely to appear in communities where television stations were located. Results revealed that Indiana respondents overwhelmingly preferred television, when compared with newspapers and radio, as a source of state news and politics.

        "description":"Noting that attention, or increased mental effort, has long been recognized as an important variable in the processing of mass communication messages, this paper examines both methodological and theoretical issues associated with the measurement of attention, particularly to the news and public affairs content in the news media. After a brief review of a number of methods of assessing attention in media research, the paper explores in detail an array of survey measures used in a panel study of the media use and level of knowledge of political and current public affairs issues of adolescents and their parents. Methodological issues addressed in this exploration include the empirical utility of several different ways of asking survey questions about attention, while theoretical  issues concern comparisons between use of newspapers and television and researchers' neglect of attention that has led to an underestimation of the importance of television news as a contributor to the public's political knowledge. The paper concludes that the measures discussed are more notable for their utility and general validity than for their reliability or precision, and that attention to news media appears to be a consistent individual difference that accounts for substantial variation in learning beyond the act of simple exposure.

        "author":["Singley, Carol J.",

        "description":"One new approach to argumentative writing in an advanced composition course uses the creative juxtaposition of rhetorical and psychological theories and behavioristic research. All of the assignments for the course simulate the kinds of writing actually performed in the professional fields of advertising, politics, business, law, and religion. Instead of writing academic papers, students gain genuine preprofessional and interdisciplinary experience by writing the ads, speeches, reports, or legal arguments that would be expected of them were they employed in these respective fields. Persuasion and argumentation are viewed as a continuum of discourse, persuasion being more closely related to the control end of the continuum, argumentation more closely related to the discovery end.  The course begins with a focus on persuasion and the theoretical background of Aristotle. This is enhanced with a study of modern psychological theory. Following a study of political persuasion, the course shifts to the forms of persuasion and argumentation that are found in legal, religious, and philosophical writing. Finally, the course considers how religious/philosophical persuasion is almost ideally suited for merging discovery and control--because religious/philosophical questions are largely unanswerable, every time the persuader re-enters the persuasive process, he or she is engaged once more in discovery with the audience. (The appendix includes outlines of three assignments given in the course and a short list of references.) (HOD)",

The second assignment (by Mary Burman) combines new fiction for junior high students with topics for library investigation by assigning a novel to read along with an investigation of the social or personal problem dealt with in the novel. The third assignment (by John Bushman) suggests activities for prewriting before a writing unit and before specific assignments. The fourth assignment (by L. D.  Groski) offers students an opportunity to explore the effects of clothes in people's lives and literature through writing, classroom discussion, and reading short stories. The fifth assignment (by Kristen Leedom) involves having students from Edgar Lee Master's \"Spoon River Anthology,\" do research on ancestors and write a poem about them, write a poem about themselves, and publish a booklet. The sixth assignment (by James Upton) presents a list of writing guidelines and related activites. The seventh assignment (by Amy Levin) discusses teaching students how to write vivid descriptions of ordinary objects. The eighth and ninth assignments, (by Duane Pitts and Joseph Foley, respectively) based on Maurice Sagoff's \"Shrinklits,\" require that students use their own words and imagination to  paraphrase a poem, story, chapter, or novel in several short rhymed verses.

The guide then lists three principles that govern the organization of instructional and performance objectives at each grade level; i.e., objectives should be organized: (1) across grade levels in developmental sequences, reflecting and promoting language and cognitive development; (2) according to the speaker's or writer's intent; and (3) in instructional  sequence for direct use by teachers. Each grade level section contains two categories--composition and conventions--under which objectives are listed. The subcategories listed under composition are developing language fluency, expressing thoughts and feelings, writing and telling stories and poems, informing an audience, and persuading an audience. The subcategories under conventions are usage and grammar, punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and handwriting.

The report concludes with the  committee's recommendations for action: (1) develop a model teacher-training program to help schools and teachers realize the promise of excellence in teaching English through intelligent use of computers; (2) develop a computer-based communication network to serve as a new medium for teacher and student writing, and as a communication channel for council business; (3) initiate and support a &quot;Schools Recognition Program for Exemplary Use of Instructional Technology in the Teaching of English&quot;; (4) begin a new era of open cooperation and collaboration with business; and (5) become a force advocating greater computer access by English teachers and students.

The paper first presents a rationale for this teaching technique and the original goals of the project, and then provides examples of students' inability to write an effective definition of a reference angle (although they were able to compute correctly a reference angle problem), indicating a lack of verbal strategies. The paper points out that one of the most useful techniques in the process of working with the students was showing the class writing efforts on slides. It then provides another example of poor verbal  strategies, noting how writing can improve requisite understanding of mathematical concepts. The paper concludes with some observations drawn from one year's efforts at using writing assignments in mathematics classes: the assignments (1) improve class participation, (2) broaden opportunities for conceptual growth even for better students in the course, (3) stimulate meaningful discussions of mathematics as a language and of strategies for learning it, (4) emphasize the kinds of writing given less attention in orthodox content area writing programs, and (5) force one to consider curriculum concerns.

        "description":"A study investigated the feasibility of presenting to primary-grade children a holistic, functional language arts program instead of a subskill one. Over 1,000 children from 16 inner city elementary schools were divided into three groups: (1) Group A, taught by teachers trained in holistic and language oriented approaches to reading and writing, who helped write the curriculum manuals; (2) Group B, taught by teachers who implemented the manuals; (3) and Group C, a control group. The children were tested three times a year on their ability to write a composition and read passages at increasing readability levels. In writing, results indicated that Group A kindergarten and first grade students performed significantly better than the other groups, but not at the second and third  grade levels. In reading, Group A students achieved more in the ability to comprehend silent reading material at increasing levels of difficulty than Group B or Group C at the first and second grade levels and did as well as the other students at the third grade level. The findings indicate that a holistic curriculum appears to be most effective for kindergarten and first and second graders and that a rapid gain in the ability to write a meaningful composition occurred in the Group A kindergarten and first grade children.

This project concerns a national development education network, which is to be supported for a new period, 1986 to 1991. EPOS is comprised of national organizations, research centers, and teacher colleges whose purposes are to assist in the establishment of a permanent position in the curriculum for development education in the first and second stages of secondary education (12-16 year olds) and to improve the quality of education in primary schools. The specific goals of development education are to teach about the lives of people in developing nations in relation to persons living in more affluent  regions of the world. Comparisons concerning poverty levels, development possibilities, cooperation, and current theories are stressed. The EPOS Project's network activities include the implementation, evaluation, modification, and development of supplementary materials and tests. The activities are directed by a national coordinating committee comprised of members representing specifically selected and involved organizations. Activities may be funded on the basis of project/activity plans submitted by the network to the national government. (JHP)",

The SLO Humanities department, which includes the subjects of geography, history, and economics, has been engaged in curriculum development in lower vocational and general secondary education programs. This group produces both theoretical publications and practical curriculum guides on such subjects as the family, mass-media, and vandalism. A primary goal of the SLO has been to improve the social and political relevance of education through the introduction of a compulsory course in the last two years of secondary education called Maatschappijleer. A primary basis of this course is that while human  thoughts and actions are influenced by society, we can learn to think autonomously and have an impact on the circumstances of our lives through choices. As a result, Maatschappijleer is defined as social and political education designed to train students to learn to live together harmoniously in a democratic and humane manner. The SLO recommends a thematic teaching approach based on introductions to social and political issues. (JHP)",

The new government's beginnings are examined in unit 1, through the pitfalls and triumphs of the First Continental Congress. The role of John Marshall, the First Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who defined the nature of America's judicial branch of government, is outlined. The next unit follows Dorothea Dix in her struggle to reform America's prison system. Unit 4 discusses Dred Scott, whose landmark case helped define some of the issues underlying the Civil War. Unit 5 investigates famous lawmen and outlaws in the old West. Discussion of the Pinkertons and the James Gang, the Earps, and the Clantons reveals insights about  law enforcement that spans both the 19th and 20th centuries. Unit 6 explores contrasting styles of executive leadership including Comanche Chief Quanah Parker, President Theodore Roosevelt, and Governor John Altgeld. Unit 7 describes the role of legal advocates through the lives of defense lawyer Clarence Darrow and prosecutor Thomas Dewey. Finally, unit 8 examines the civil rights movement. Each unit includes photos, discussion questions and follow-up activities. (RSL)",

Since they are among the most important legacies U.S. citizens have, they deserve a prominent place in the curricula of schools and the general education of citizens. But most people do not adequately understand the Constitution and lack both awareness and knowledge of the Northwest Ordinance. Most secondary school U.S. history textbooks include less than one page on the Northwest Ordinance and it is not a part of the standard secondary school courses in civics and government. There also is a need for improvement in the quality and quantity of course content on the Constitution. Recent studies recommend using the concurrent anniversaries of the two documents as an opportunity to promote and  emphasize both documents in the core curricula of secondary schools. The following concepts should be emphasized in history, government, and civics classes: (1) U.S. innovations in constitutional definition, constitution-making, and state-making; (2) historical and contemporary comparisons of constitutional change in the United States and variations in types of constitutions and governments around the world; and (3) international connections of U.S. constitutional government, both in their origins and subsequent global influences.

This leads to a development of cross-cultural communication among various subcultures within a multi-ethnic environment. The Social Actions Office at each Air Force base offers required orientation sessions on discrimination and standards. This office was established in 1973, under Regulation 30-2, as a result of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, racial disturbances at military bases, and statistics which indicated that blacks received harsher military punishments than whites. Regulation 30-2 and others outline specific discriminatory behavior and state proper standards of military  conduct. Orientation sessions emphasize the reasons discrimination exists, the need for communication, and how individual perceptions influence interracial, interpersonal, and intercultural communications. The U.S. Air Force stresses that arbitrary discrimination negatively affects its mission and image. It also teaches understanding and appreciation of individual characteristics and cultural differences. (JHP)",

Research suggests that elementary students do not like or value social studies when these traditional methods are used to organize and teach its content. The goals of the social studies curriculum in grades K-6 are to transmit citizenship skills to children and to develop the skill areas of information processing, critical thinking, problem solving, communication, spatial awareness, social interaction, and time concepts. Through the use of picture and story books, teachers can utilize characters, plots, settings, themes, and relationships to introduce activities that assist in developing these skills. Fictional books contain information about people and relationships, emerging  values, the effect of institutions on personal behavior, and lessons about people from various time periods and diverse cultural backgrounds. Children's fiction is also a source of useful information about historical events, current issues, global themes, and lifestyles. The most efficient form of delivery for this teaching method is for the teacher to read the books to the class and to plan which skills will be taught. (JHP)",

Teachers must create classroom conditions which elicit civic writing and suggest civic or political purposes for it. Examples of advocacy writing which can be used to propose a public policy issue law, to support or oppose a proposed law, to propose a law designating a state symbol or special day, to identify a problem and propose a  solution, and to influence attitudes about identified social or political issues are presented. Methods of teaching and examples of civic writing which are motivated by a spirit of collaborative concern for others, especially in regard to local government, are presented. These include providing information, evaluating public programs, expressing support, and obtaining information. Civic writing can have a positive effect on the students' perceptions of themselves as writers and as citizens. (JHP)",

Although included in nearly every secondary school curriculum, education on the U.S. Constitution has suffered from neglect and routine treatment. The educational agenda is cluttered, and priorities are often unclear. Instructional goals about the Constitution may be viewed as no more important than other goals in the vast array of competing purposes of education in social studies. Studies of standard secondary school textbooks have revealed restricted coverage and shallow treatment of basic principles, values, and issues of constitutional government.  Studies have found that the U.S. public appears to be deficient in both knowledge and appreciation of fundamental values, principles, and issues of their constitutional government. Some of the suggestions for improving education on the Constitution are: (1) assigning a high priority to educational goals of the Constitution; (2) blending social history with political history; (3) emphasizing the applicability of the Constitution to the common concern of citizens; and (4) obtaining high quality learning materials on the Constitution to complement the standard textbook. A list of resources and references are included in the digest. (SM)",

State-by-state surveys of the status of females in education are used to measure this progress. The 1986 PEER report attempted to measure states' commitment to excellence and equity in education. Each state's commitment to education was measured by: (1) expenditures for education as a percentage of per capita income; (2) the ratio of students to teachers in classrooms; (3) teacher salaries; and (4) the high school graduation rate. To measure states according to how well young women were being prepared for higher education, the survey ranked them on: (1) the gap between high school women's and men's Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)  scores; (2) women's expressed goals for higher education; and (3) their interest in &quot;non-traditional&quot; science careers. An assessment of women's college enrollments and the undergraduate and graduate degrees they received was also reported. The report evaluated women's participation in vocational training programs. PEER focused attention on the impact of combined sex, race, and disability bias and discrimination. Included in the report were state-by-state charts showing SAT mathematics and verbal scores, male and female differences on SAT tests, young women's graduate degree goals, young women's career aspirations in the physical sciences, public university and college enrollment, degrees awarded, and enrollment in vocational training programs.

State folk cultural programs that function in an official capacity for their respective areas are listed in chapter two, which points out that folk arts coordinators can provide valuable information on publications, programs, and resources in their states. Societies with specific cultural interests, such as the Southern Appalachian  Dulcimer Association, provide an invaluable source for information on folk culture and are identified in chapter three. Organizations and institutions included in chapter four have an on-going programmatic interest in folklife study, conservation, and presentation demonstrated either through their own activities or grant support. Chapter five identifies serial publications available for the study of folklife. Chapter six describes archives which are oriented primarily to folklore, folklife, and ethnomusicology. These archives have special collections of significance, or have been included on the recommendation of state folk cultural programs. Higher education programs in folklore and folklife will be found in chapter seven of the directory. Chapter eight identifies recording companies in  North America specializing in folk music.

        "description":"A recent study by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) directly links writing effectiveness to development of skills in critical thinking. This ERIC Digest discusses: (1) recent research on the linkage between writing and learning; (2) successful approaches to teaching writing; and (3) suggestions for including an effective writing component in the social studies curriculum. Research indicates that writing enhances learning in several ways: (1) writing requires knowledge and focuses thought; (2) writing enhances critical thinking; and (3) writing shifts responsibility for learning to the student. Of the two most frequently used approaches to teaching writing, one emphasizing the product and the other emphasizing the process, the product approach is the most  accepted but the process approach is rapidly gaining adherents. The process approach indicates an awareness of the linkage between writing, thinking, and learning. The NAEP study found that students who used elements of process writing (planning, revising, and editing) are more likely to be better writers. For social studies teachers, the best approach appears to be a blend of the process and product approach. The most effective method of using writing to enhance learning and encourage creative and critical thinking appears to be the development and use of writing assignments that stimulate and challenge students. The NAEP study also found that students who write more, write better. This finding coupled with evidence that critical thinking and higher order intellectual skills are nurtured  by appropriate writing assignments makes a powerful case for increasing the amount of student writing in social studies. A list of resources for teaching writing in social studies is included. (SM)",

These forms of uncertainty undermine teachers' authority, creating situations where they must weigh the uncertainty of teaching against the responsibility for guidanace built into the relationship between teacher and student. Attempts of teacher education programs to &quot;prepare&quot; teachers to face uncertainty should result in teachers' increased ability to carry out the primary functions of teaching, promotion of teachers' psychological health, and intellectual honesty within the program. Preservice teachers could be  taught to expect, recognize, and understand uncertainty as well as make appropriate responses to it. Teacher education programs can promote this knowledge through such activities as: providing knowledge about uncertainty; finding out what students know about uncertainty; predicting the effects of teaching; thinking about the content of instruction; analyzing the bases of classroom authority; reflecting on learning to teach; and practicing and coaching reaction to uncertainty in real settings.

This system was organized so that one master teacher could instruct from 200 to 1,000 pupils at one time. The pupils would be divided into groups of ten taught by a monitor who was responsible for issuing books and slates to pupils. As they learned the lessons appropriate for their group, students were promoted to the next group. The system taught four curricular areas--reading, writing, spelling, and arithmetic. Memorization of learning was the teaching method emphasized. The system, which spread rapidly in the United States, helped to  foster the normal school approach later adopted in the United States.

        "description":"This paper examines teacher assessment in light of contemporary cognitive science and anthropological research on teaching. Attention is given to why some teacher tests are inappropriate for assessing competence and the need for development of an effective, comprehensive assessment system that acknowledges the inadequacy of current test structures. The potential of using the case method for overcoming these difficulties is rooted in the premises drawn from cognitive science and anthropology. A case method assessment system is proposed, in which teachers respond to cases that reflect the complexity of teaching. The potential of three frameworks--intended instruction, problem situations, and dilemmas--are examined as possible vehicles for assessing the knowledge teachers employ to  simplify their work and accomplish their intentions over time. Ways of judging teacher responses to these cases are also discussed. (CB)",

This report provides estimates of the beginning and average teacher salary levels that should be reached in order to ensure that the public schools are able to attract and retain talented and capable individuals as teachers. Sections of the report cover: the Comparability Principle used to estimate teacher salaries and compare them with salaries of other college-educated workers; method of analysis; results of analysis; an Earnings Comparability Mutiple Regression Model; and conclusions and  recommendations. It was concluded that, although beginning teacher salaries in the Southeast have risen steadily over the past four years, the average teacher salary in the Southeast is still below the average starting salary of other college-educated workers. Furthermore, there has been little progress in closing the gap between the average teacher salary and the average salary of other college-educated workers. (CB)",

The concepts of instruction, classroom management, student socialization, and disciplinary intervention as functions commonly performed by teachers are defined. It is argued that a sustained focus is needed on a single integrated approach, taught as an action system that includes attention not only to propositional knowledge (concerning principles of effective management) but also to procedural knowledge (of how to implement these principles) and conditional knowledge (of when and why to implement them). Other recommended elements include conceptual change teaching designed to confront and correct inappropriate attitudes or  beliefs that students may bring with them; emphasizing the basics by concentrating on the most commonly occurring classroom teaching situations; and developing skills as much as possible through the apprenticeship approach (modeling, coaching, scaffolding/fading) but supplementing this as needed with didactic instruction in basic concepts and skills, structured classroom observation and student teaching experiences, and use of case materials and simulation exercises as substitutes for field experiences that cannot be included in the program.

Teachers were observed three separate times by three different trained observers for the following competencies: academic learning time; accountability; clarity of structure; individual differences; evaluation; affective climate; learner self-concept; meaningfulness; planning; questioning skill; reinforcement; and close supervision. It was found that teachers who had teacher training scored significantly higher on the competencies of affective climate and  individual differences than teachers who had no teacher training. However, teachers with no teacher training scored higher on the competencies of accountability and questioning skill. It is suggested that preservice training of potential teachers be modified to ensure that teachers get training in each of the competency areas. (CB)",

Supervisors in this study included a novice with 11 years of elementary classroom teaching experience and a master's degree, while another had 5 years experience as a supervisor with 10 years of classroom teaching experience and training in supervision and teacher  preparation/staff development, and the third had 3 years of supervisory experience with 20 years classroom teaching experience and a doctorate in reading/language arts. Results indicated that degree of satisfaction with the position, desire to continue in the position, and degree of comfort varied with experience, education, and personal attributes. All three supervisors were able to identify and weigh the evaluative criteria they used in supervising student teachers, but the actual criteria varied widely among the supervisors.

Structured interviews were conducted with 32 supervising teachers working with student teachers, some of whom were also interviewed. Synthesis of data collected from these interviews resulted in a broad profile of the supervising teachers and their behaviors. &quot;Excellent&quot; supervising teachers tended to prepare in advance for the student teacher; emphasize a positive beginning to student teaching; seek appropriate information from student teachers; convey expectations to student teachers; arrange and conduct effective pre-lesson and post-lesson discussion; provide opportunities for purposeful observation of student teachers;  cooperate with training institution faculty; afford some autonomy to student teachers; and establish rapport with student teachers.

Analysis of 1,600 hours of paperwork revealed that teacher paperwork includes a great variety of activities, with over 200 different activities reported under 16 categories of paperwork. A total of 100 teachers from four participation school districts (two from New Castle County, Delaware, one from Kent County, Delaware and one from Sussex  County, Delaware) were selected for the sample. Time spent on paperwork varied from teacher to teacher. Seven major types of paperwork--classwork, evaluation/grading, homework, report cards, special projects, test development, and school correspondence--accounted for 81 percent of time spent on paperwork. Teacher spent about eight hours each week both during and after the school day doing paperwork. Most difficult types of paperwork were those relating to special education or parents.

Treatment group subjects were instructed in skills relating to the those measured by the OSU-SIGMA by preservice physical education majors in eight weekly 40-minute sessions. Post-training data indicated that treatment group subjects improved on running, throwing, catching, jumping, and ladder climbing, while control group subjects showed no improvement between pre- and post-training measures.

Furthermore, the problem has been complicated by grade inflation since the 1960s. As a result of this vagueness in the meaning of college grades, states have become more involved in college student assessment, especially through the use of standardized tests. It is recommended that: (1) colleges and universities continue to monitor grade inflation; (2) colleges consider changing from a five-point to a 13-point grading scale; (3) colleges consider the  use of criterion-referenced grading rather than norm-referenced grading; (4) state agencies involve university and college faculty in studying and adopting changes; (5) standardized tests be developed at the state or local level, since the United States does not have a national curriculum; and (6) an instructional model be used to assess students before college entry, during the undergraduate program, and at graduation.

Thirty-three percent achieved state-mandated proficiency on the verbal subtests of the CBSPT, 51% on mathematics computation, and 26% on elementary algebra. In each category, proficiency was positively correlated with class rank. The average Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) score, among those who took  the SAT, was 488 in mathematics and 436 in verbal. Fifty-three percent of the students were attending two-year colleges, and 47% were at four-year colleges.

        "description":"Using a qualitative approach, documents were reviewed and teachers, peer evaluators, instructional supervisors, and administrators were interviewed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of peer evaluation programs in three school districts. Specifically, this study examines peer involvement in the summative evaluation of teachers in three school districts: Sunnyside School District (California); Oceanview School District (New York); and Midtown Public Schools, an urban system in a large, midwestern city. The districts differed in size, socioeconomic status and length of involvement with a peer evaluation program, but all three gave high ratings to their own peer evaluation program. While one district used peer evaluation only at the secondary level, another focused on teacher  remediation. The third district had a mandatory Teacher Development Program including a model career ladder, and peer evaluation for all new teachers. Three themes emerged as critically important in all three districts: professional involvement; collegial relationships; and blending of bureaucratic and professional authority. It was concluded that: (1) teacher involvement was beneficial in securing teacher commitment and in maximizing both teacher observation time and sources of expertise within a district; (2) decisions about the extent and form of peer evaluation should be made at the school district level; (3) teachers can be very effective peer evaluators, despite feelings of role conflict; and (4) combining teachers' and administrators' authority can provide checks and balances to  the evaluation procedure and improve the validity of the results.

        "description":"The Federal Government will spend an estimated $1.5 billion in fiscal year 1986 for the production and publication of statistical data. This estimate represents the expected obligations for statistical activities of over 70 agencies or departmental units reporting outlays of at least $500,000 for such activities in their budgets for any of fiscal years 1984-1986. For some agencies, their sole mission is to compile and publish statistics, but for most, statistical work is part of or supports other programmatic missions. The first section contains tables showing obligations for statistics (1984, 1985, 1986) for agencies under the 13 cabinet departments and for 10 independent agencies. A short paragraph describes the statistical activities of each agency and any changes in program  direction. The second section describes major developments and shows expenditures in three subject groupings: (1) natural resources and environment (28% share); (2) economy (35%); and (3) demographic and social (32%). The third section reports on funding of Federal statistical activities, charting the flow of funds between agencies, between the Federal Government and states and localities, and between Federal Government agencies and the private sector. Appendices show current-dollar statistical budgets by agency and a constant-dollar index by department for 1977-86. (LPG)",

        "description":"A method for obtaining curriculum-based estimates of student achievement is described. These estimates can be obtained through the use of a set of curriculum weights designed to reflect student opportunity to learn. If the match between the presented curriculum and test content is low, then the curriculum weights can be used to minimize potential curriculum bias which may occur when the students have not had an opportunity to learn the objectives measured by the test items. A small example and application of the curriculum-based estimates using a 40-item arithmetic test from the Second International Mathematics Study was used to illustrate the method. Posttest data from 2,606 eighth and twelfth grade students in 165 U.S. classrooms were included in the final sample. It is  concluded that curriculum-based estimates offer a practicable approach for individualized scoring based on content considerations. (Author/GDC)",

According to the model, needs represents personality and press represents the environment. This research was designed to replicate a previous study by Steinhoff (1965) which isolated six first-order factors and two higher-order factors on the OCI. Twelve first-order factors and four second-order factors were also available for the AI. The respondents included 331 public school teachers and administrators from an urban school system; 171 were administered the AI and 160 were administered the OCI. AI reliability was .62 to .91, and OCI reliability was .61 to  .89. Results of the various one-way analyses of variance indicated that the AI discriminated between groups; the OCI did not. Factor analysis performed on the OCI data and the combined AI and OCI data did not confirm the factors reported in Steinhoff's study. Refinement of the OCI was suggested along with further research involving interaction of the needs and press components. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"This paper argues that just as imagination has been important for the inception and promotion of invitational education, it is also necessary for the development of inviting research strategies. Applying the educative process to the study of inviting, recommendations are made for relating the constituent parts of the inviting stance (optimism, respect, trust, and intentionality) and factors (people, places, policies, and programs) to construct an imaginative research structure. Next, a heuristic analysis of the inviting process is presented in a series of imaginative monologues as they might be delivered by the theorists Edward de Bono, Donald Schon, and Abraham Edel. The analysis from de Bono's perspective generates questions based on his &quot;six hat thinking&quot; model, finally  emphasizing the role of optimism, emotion, and intuition in invitational education and the need to promote creative and reflective thinking. A critique in the manner of Schon shows vacillation in invitational education between technical rationality and an epistemology of practice, and an ambiguity between a salesmanship stance and true mutuality. Edel's work is used to connect invitational education with several larger social issues: global perspective, equality, democratization, responsible technology, competition, community, and humanism. The final section of the paper suggests a metaphor, model and method for integrating theory, research, and practice. (Author/LPG)",

        "author":["Ackerman, Terry A."],
        "description":"Concern has been expressed over the item response theory (IRT) assumption that a person's ability can be estimated in a unidimensional latent space. To examine whether or not the response to an item requires only a single latent ability, unidimensional ability estimates were compared for data generated from the multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) compensatory and noncompensatory models. It was hypothesized that as the correlation between the two dimensional abilities increased, the response data would essentially become unidimensional and thus the confounding of difficulty and dimensionality would have little effect in either model. This study examined the unidimensional estimates of matched compensatory and noncompensatory data in which difficulty was confounded with  dimensionality for different levels of correlation between two dimensional abilities. Eight data sets, four compensatory, and four noncompensatory, were generated. Each set was calibrated using the IRT calibration programs LOGIST and BILOG. BILOG calibration of response vectors generated to the matched MIRT item parameters appeared to be more affected than LOGIST by the confounding of difficulty and dimensionality. As the correlation between the generated two dimensional abilities increased, the response data appeared to become more unidimensional. Six figures are included. (Author/MDE)",

        "description":"The concurrent validity of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was examined by comparing K-ABC scores and Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised (WISC-R) scores for 58 school children in primary and intermediate grades. Thirty-seven of these children had either educable mental retardation, learning disabilities, or emotional disturbances; six were gifted. To determine if these scores were related or significantly different, t-tests, Pearson r correlations, a canonical correlation, and regression equations were computed. Results indicated that mean scores of the scales of both the WISC-R and the K-ABC did not differ significantly. Also, significant correlations were obtained since all scales were highly interrelated. Separate K-ABC achievement subscale  scores were also correlated with the K-ABC's mental processing composite subscale score. These outcomes suggested that the K-ABC possesses high concurrent validity when compared with the WISC-R. However, it may be premature to assume that the K-ABC is an adequate substitute.

        "description":"Some special problems associated with evaluating intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) programs are addressed. This paper intends to describe alternative approaches to the assessment and improvement of such applications and to provide examples of efforts undertaken and shortfalls. Issues discussed stem chiefly from the technical demands of the artificial intelligence field, which have tended to limit most evaluation efforts to first-party evaluation by project staff. ICAI evaluation should make use of a range of formative (e.g., componential analysis) and summative (e.g., cost analysis) evaluation methods with multiple criterion measures. Standardized tests have not proved sensitive enough in this area; domain-referenced tests are especially well suited to ICAI,  because their success depends on experts' care in constructing detailed specifications of the knowledge domain. Individual differences in students' intelligence, cognitive styles, and state anxiety should also be considered. As evaluators sharpen their goals, they will be able to select the most relevant data to collect, and present useful instructional options. Special recommendations for ICAI evaluation include: (1) developing an expectation of evaluation; (2) rewarding evaluation participation; (3) increasing credibility of the evaluating team by encouraging expert participation; (4) adapting evaluation to specific features of ICAI development; (5) performing componential analysis of software under development; and (6) maintaining both a responsible and responsive approach.

The core database included variables addressing: (1) background information about students; (2) information  on student outcomes, both academic and affective; (3) classroom processes; and (4) school content including parent involvement. The types of reports desired by district superintendents, school principals, and teachers were compared. District leaders and principals favored analysis of trends over time, whereas teachers wanted a detailed breakdown of student characteristics and current achievement. All groups preferred that a one-page synthesis of data be designed to meet their particular needs. Steps for insuring quality control in data collection and for providing support in data interpretation and use were recommended. (LPG)",

Participating parents agree to support seven family goals to enhance reading and to keep a log of activities and progress. In six experimental and six comparison schools, reading achievement gains were assessed using the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the family log, a reading inventory, and a parent survey. Achievement gains were above national averages in all schools, with experimental schools slightly favored. Parents in both groups reported similar patterns of helping their  children and similar perceptions of improved attitudes on the childrens' part. Over half the students said they liked to read; a fifth felt stories they read in school were too long or difficult. Strong positive correlations were found between improved reading, setting aside a specific time for study, and parental help with homework. Most of the parents (76%) considered the program to be a happy one; only about half felt it was easy. (MGD)",

The first phase was one of explicit concern for equity, challenging the works of Coleman and Jencks which suggested that achievement differences were more associated with family background than school variables. This research focused on low socioeconomic status urban schools. Phase two was characterized by implicit concerns for efficiency. While controlling for financial expenditures, those variables associated with achievement outcomes were investigated. The third developmental phase of ESR may draw on research done outside of the rubric of ESR to understand forces present in individual classrooms, larger organizational settings, and communities. Using a heuristic of political economy  permits researchers to examine the effect of multiple variables on both equity and efficiency of resource utilization and learning.

The 27-item rating scale was completed by 126 individuals, a 72% return rate. Analyses revealed a number of issues where respondent groups' opinions differed. Former students differed with faculty on the degree to which they were encouraged to participate in ongoing research and on the opportunities afforded them to co-author papers. In some cases, the faculty did not have an active research agenda. Currently enrolled students, especially those without an assistantship, tended to be neutral regarding research climate  issues. Many of these students lived off-campus and commuted to campus only once or twice per week, or enrolled in summer school and independent study. The survey also indicated that current graduate students were unclear about the role of the doctoral candidate's advisory committee with regard to open proposal meetings and seeking counsel. Other issues yielding discrepant opinions were quotas on student admission, availability of financial support, and faculty teaching load. (The survey and a data table are appended). (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"Studies of causal attributions among elementary school children and their mothers in Japan and in the United States indicate that the Japanese are more likely to cite effort as the primary cause of school achievement. In the United States, ability is more frequently selected as a key factor. The characteristics of Japanese mother-child interaction and of social relations within the elementary classroom illustrate that the cooperative social contexts of home and school shape causal attribution by mothers and children. Research from the United States on attribution within both cooperative and competitive reward structures illustrates how the cooperative nature of Japanese achievement settings is likely to foster attribution to effort rather than ability. Analysis indicates that  attributional patterns must be evaluated in conjunction with the social context of achievement. Japanese achievement settings are described as being strongly supported by parents and peers, with both home and school settings reflecting the cooperative and interdependent nature of Japanese society. It is recommended that extrapolation to the United States should consider the context in which Japanese achievement occurs as well as the differences in societal context between the United States and Japan. A five-page reference list is included. (Author/MDE)",

To determine the passing score as it would be set by a representative peer group, a survey was mailed to a random sample of 200 recently certified nurses. Three questions were asked: (1) what percentage of examinees should pass; (2) what percentage of questions should be answered correctly for certification; and (3) what score should be achieved for certification, given a hypothetical distribution of scores on a 75-item test. There were 98 responses. Respondents indicated that a mean of 70.36% should pass. The currently used Angoff technique resulted in a passing rate of 87.96%. The mean percentage of questions that should be answered correctly was  calculated to be 71.28% according to the survey, 56% as set by committee. The mean score that should be achieved for certification was calculated to be 53.81%. In comparison to the current standards set by committee, the peer group set higher standards. They also showed an unexpected correspondence between percentage correct required for passing and the percentage actually passing. Comparison models suggested by Hofstee and Beuk, when applied to the survey data, indicated that 61-63% of the examinees should pass, with scores of 64-67% required to pass. (MGD)",

The samples adequately represented geographic regions and genders. In addition, data were gathered on racial and ethnic groups: Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, Caucasian, American Indian, native Alaskan, and other. The purpose of the testing program was to analyze achievement test data and to report findings that might be used by ROTC to develop diagnostic and screening standards. The results indicated that females scored higher than males in English; males scored higher in  mathematics; and there were no substantial differences in reading. On all tests, the ethnic minority groups scored lower than Caucasians, with substantial differences for Blacks and Hispanics. The mean scores of MSI cadets were consistently lower than those of MSIV cadets. Although further research was recommended in order to establish cutting score standards for potential officers, it was noted that about 20% of MSI cadets might profit from remedial instruction in English and reading.

Two versions of the interval Academic Learning Time in Physical Education (ALT-PE) instrument and an equivalent time sampling method were compared with actual time students spent in motor performance. Subjects were 36 college students enrolled in six different physical education classes: aerobic dance, badminton, basketball, fencing, karate, and volleyball. All instruction was videotaped so that each student could be coded throughout the class. The actual student engaged time and engaged time as estimated by the time sampling instrument were significantly  lower than the time as estimated with the two ALT-PE instruments. In addition, a class type by coding instrument interaction occurred indicating that the difference was present for all classes except aerobic dance, where activity is continuous. This result suggests that the popularity of the ALT-PE instruments should be reexamined. (Author/GDC)",

Questions were divided into three general categories: background information on the student; plans for college or work after graduation; and opinions of courses, activities, and quality of instruction. Findings showed that, on the whole, pupils liked high school and a good number were pleased with the quality of teachers and instruction. They felt school spirit and school appearance needed  improvement. They were dissatisfied with course offerings, counseling services, and school rules. Many were also dissatisfied with the quality of teachers and/or instruction. The report consists of charts and statistics of survey findings.

A total of 32,387 students in kindergarten through grade 9 participated. Across all districts, 66 percent of the program students met the suggested criterion of 24 or more absences in 1983-84; and an additional 6.4 percent of the students were long-term absentees (LTA). Almost half were overage for their grade. The numbers of students targeted in districts and the characteristics of district populations varied considerably. AIDP funds enabled school districts to provide a combination of incentives and services to students, including counseling, family outreach, referrals to outside agencies, and attendance monitoring. Some apparently successful  program features were: a clearly defined procedure for selecting students; a multidisciplinary team approach; active involvement by program administrators and district staff; competent and energetic staff; regularly scheduled staff development activities; immediate follow-up on student absence; and individualized attention to students on a regular basis. The greatest weakness was that the extraordinary effort required to get LTA students to return to school detracted from the more productive efforts with other students. The average daily attendance of program students improved in all but one district. Program areas in need of improvement include the program policy, staffing, and student selection. Statistical data on student attendance are presented in 15 tables. (KH)",

It presents the characteristics of the schools and students in the program; describes program implementation; analyzes attendance, courses passed, and promotion rates for the student participants; and  presents conclusions and recommendation. Three appendices provide additional information on data collection procedures and school-by-school program implementations.

        "description":"The Biliteracy Skills Development Project at George Washington High School (New York, New York) completed its final year of a three-year funding cycle in June 1986. Using a mini-school structure, the program sought to enable students to develop oral proficiency in English and literacy skills in both English and Spanish through intensive language instruction. The program served 221 students, most of whom were semi-literate (in Spanish) recent arrivals from the Dominican Republic. Students received intensive English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction, native language skills instruction, and bilingual instruction in content areas. Efforts were made to keep curricula and materials in the program courses parallel with those of mainstream courses, and the program included staff  support (e.g., computer training) and parent education. In 1985-86, the project underwent several personnel and curriculum changes. A Literacy Assistance Project (LAP) was launched to plan further improvements in George Washington's bilingual education program. An evaluation of this year found that students were making good progress as a result of their involvement in the intensive language component of the program, and all program instructional goals were met. Bilingual students were considered better motivated and had better school attendance records than mainstream students, and the bilingual program received recognition within and outside the school for its student achievement. This evaluation report includes recommendations for improving the program's effectiveness and four  appendices providing data on staff and course characteristics. (KH)",

The project's goal was to help limited English proficient (LEP) students acquire proficiency in English while they developed reading and writing skills in their native languages. This goal was pursued through instruction in English as a second language (ESL) and native language arts, and bilingual instruction in mathematics, science, and social studies. The project served a total of 293 Hispanic, Chinese and Haitian LEP students at three Queens high schools. In addition to basic instructional goals, Project CAREERS aimed to teach basic skills in health-, law-, and business-related subjects, and to foster a positive career orientation. Title VII funds supported administrative and  support staff positions, including a resource teacher and paraprofessional located at each site. Two of the schools were provided with a resource room for the project's career-oriented component. In 1985-86, the adaptation of curricular materials designed to parallel the mainstream program was in progress, and a series of training sessions for staff members was held. Each school established the proposed ESL/Americanization classes for parents, and parent advisory councils were established at each site. Instructional objectives were reached in English language achievement, but below the stated criterion for the program. This evaluation report includes recommendations for future programs serving similar populations. (KH)",

        "description":"Rapid employment growth in a 10-county nonmetro area in southern Georgia provided jobs, but not for most longer term resident households whose head lived in the area during the years from 1976 through 1981. Despite the area's impressive job growth during these years only 20% of the long term resident households had more workers in 1981 than in 1976, and only 27% had a stable economic history. Their average income levels fell. The 1976-81 income gap was stable between households headed by the elderly and nonelderly, between blacks and whites, and between males and females. Employment did not assure escape from poverty and did not reduce the area's overall poverty rate. Age or disability kept many of the poor from working. Most working poor households were headed by blacks whose  weekly wages were far below those of whites. A few poor households benefitted from the area's expanding job opportunities, but as many households entered poverty as escaped poverty. Factors, other than employment, which increased income were: (1) household size; (2) number of household members working; (3) hours worked; (4) real weekly wages; (5) education; (6) health status; and (7) other sources of income. This case study report includes a 57-item list of references and an appendix which describes the analysis procedures used in the study. (Author/VM)",

Kennedy High School, 150 Haitians at Prospect Heights High School, and 88 Italians at Christopher Columbus High School. The project was centrally administered, but the project's style of functioning at each site was influenced by the attitudes of the staff, the characteristics and needs of students, and other factors. This year's major change occurred at Prospect Heights, where a new assistant principal for foreign languages was given responsibility for administering the project. Prospect Heights was adversely affected by the shortage of  both Haitian Creole-speaking teachers and texts, but nonetheless the program there has undergone promising improvements. At Kennedy, the project was integral to the bilingual education department, but at Christopher Columbus non-project-related staff voiced skepticism about the project, and it was the only school which did not offer native language instruction. The different sites varied in meeting program student achievement goals, and the dropout rate of program students was virtually zero. The following recommendations might improve future multi-site programs: (1) selected schools might be closer to one another and/or might serve students from the same language group; and (2) funds for continuing COPE-like services should be raised to meet the needs of the continuing influx of  Spanish-speaking students at Kennedy and Prospect Heights.

They are providing mainly low cost services minority of the recipients. They are providing low cost services such as job search assistance to those people who need the least help in entering the work force. The programs do not solve the employability problems of those with little education or work experience. The current multiplicity of program authorizations within Title IV of the Social Security Act results in division of responsibilities, duplication of effort, complex and conflicting regulations, and unintentional incentives created by disparate funding levels. This testimony recommends that Congress consider  legislation that: (1) encourages states to target AFDC recipients who are most at risk for long welfare stays; (2) encourages states to provide more intensive support services such as remedial education; (3) encourages the provision of more support services during and after participation in a work program; (4) provides for performance standards that reflect gains in employability; (5) consolidates the multiplicity of AFDC work programs into one comprehensive program; and (6) requires the collection of standardized information about participants, activities, and outcomes.

Black communities are in a state of deterioration for which the treatment must be self-help. In this paper the example of an unhealthy organism is used as a metaphor for prescribing a cure for the ills of the black community. The suggested remedies are educational improvements and economic development generated from inside the community. Curing the educational crisis will require: (1) courses on black history; (2) the use of church activities as a base to teach, develop skills, and engender self-confidence; and (3) the fusing of education with social activities which include African-American history as part of their agenda  and which use creative approaches for presenting the material, including multi-media presentations and awards. Poor personal spending habits have caused the erosion of the economic base in the black community. To insure the stabilization and growth of the community, persons who receive their income from the community must be residents of it and those who profit from the community must reinvest 10 percent of their profits back into it. The integration of business and professional persons into the community will result in better police protection, a lower crime rate, and more quality housing, as well as providing role models and work opportunities for youth.

The aides provided direct instruction to pupils under the supervision of the teachers. Emphasis was placed on oral language, written language, and reading skills. These three targeted areas were the focus of inservice training sessions for the aides. Pretest and posttest scores were analyzed for pupils who attended at least 118 days (80%) of the program. The results showed that the objective of raising each child's score one point for every month of instruction was met in the kindergarten component  where the average gain per month was 2.1 points. The first grade component did not meet the growth objective since the average gain per month was 0.2 points. However, teacher ratings showed that the skills of targeted pupils were substantially enhanced by the instructional aides. Thirteen tables present graphic displays of the data in this report.

        "description":"If U.S. birthrates remain below the replacement level and are relatively constant, and if immigration is constant both in total numbers and age-sex composition, population size will eventually become stationary, according to this policy discussion paper. Moverover, varying the constant annual number of immigrants produces an equal proportionate change in the size of the resulting stationary population. A third, often overlooked factor that can affect stationary population size is changes in immigrants' ages. Projections of the 1980 population that assume the admission of 560,000 U.S. immigrants each year show that the ultimate stationary population contains 14.4 million people if immigrants are admitted only at ages 50 to 54. But when all immigrants are admitted at ages 10-14,  the resulting stationary population is 328.3 million. Thus, age at admission makes a large demographic difference--in this case, a size difference of almost 23 to 1. The intuitive reason for the large difference is that 50-year-old migrants are too old to contribute descendants born in their new country. Teenage migrants, on the other hand, contribute not only themselves but also descendants, and their descendants will in turn further reproduce. To the degree that national policy wants to use immigration to build up population size or allow it to decrease, policy could take more account of immigrants' ages. Data are presented in the text and on tables and graphs. List of references and related titles are appended. (Author/KH)",

The data were reported by the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to the Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service. Section 1 of the report describes the study background and objectives; section 2 presents statistics and analysis. Major findings, based on data available as of February 23, 1987, include the following: (1) the number of households applying for food stamps, nationwide, declined from about 16.8 million in fiscal year 1983 to about  6 million in fiscal 1985--a decline of about 25 percent. The percentage of applications approved and denied remained relatively constant at about 80 and 20 percent, respectively. (2) The total estimated number of households participating in the program nationwide declined from about 13.7 million in 1983 to about 12.8 million in 1985--a 7 percent decline. Participation increased in 11 states, while 42 states experienced declines. (3) The percentage of cases in which households' benefits were reported by the states as improperly denied or terminated declined from 1980 through 1985. State-by-state, improper denials or termination over this period ranged from zero in Delaware to over 11 percent in Washington State (1984 and 1985) and the District of Columbia (1981).

Next the report discusses approaches to explaining achievement trends. The longest section of the report discusses possible causes of those trends, among which are the following: (1) the changing ethnic composition of the school-age population; (2) increasing family size; (3) a  watering down of course content in secondary schools; (4) changes in the amount of homework done by high school students; (5) Title I/Chapter 1 programs; (6) desegregation; and (7) changes in students' use of alcohol and other drugs. Also discussed are factors which probably did not contribute to the trend, such as state graduation standards. The report then evaluates educational policies and recommends ways of improving educational achievement.

        "description":"The morbidity and mortality rates for cancer are higher for blacks than for whites. The following three contending theories offer possible explanations for these rates: (1) the histology types among cancers of the same site are distributed differently for blacks and whites; (2) there is increased susceptibility in lower social classes, of which many blacks are members; and (3) early detection of cancer is less frequent among minority populations. The latter explanation shows the necessity for developing educational interventions to increase cancer awareness. To design these interventions and to assess the community understanding of cancer, a survey on cancer awareness was conducted. The findings were the following: (1) knowledge of cancer warning signs was high; (2) myths about  cancer and its treatment were believed slightly more by women than men; (3) there was optimism that a cure would be found; and (4) cancer-related medical care behavior was fair to good. These findings imply that interventions are needed to demystify cancer, to increase the involvement of medical personnel in early detection, and to develop continuing education programs especially for older people. This paper includes a list of 23 references and 9 tables of statistics. (VM)",

        "description":"This paper evaluates the effect of Federal resettlement policy on Southeast Asian refugee women's employment training programs and describes the extent to which this training contributed to the refugees' economic mobility and acculturation. The report is divided into three major sections. Part 1 introduces the study by discussing its background, purpose and conceptual framework, and data collection methods. Data were derived from a survey of key refugee leaders and resettlement personnel, a pilot study conducted in St. Paul and Minneapolis (Minnesota) (cities with large refugee populations and extensive employment training programs), and a concentrated study of nine additional sites concerning Federal resettlement policy on educational assistance to refugees. Part 2 presents an  historical overview of public policy and refugee training from 1975 to 1985. Part 3 describes existing programs providing preemployment training and training for a number of different industries. The study's principal finding is that Federal employment training policy resulted in the training of large numbers of refugees for the secondary labor market. Once entering that market, however, frequent layoffs and low pay caused refugees to move back and forth between jobs and welfare. Most women's training focused on preparation for jobs in industrial sewing, electronics assembly, or the cleaning industry--all jobs involving the lowest skills and the lowest pay. Nevertheless, training programs appear to have helped refugee women acquire confidence and adapt to their new environment by  providing a supportive atmosphere. (KH)",

        "description":"This report analyzes recent Census data on poverty and income for 1986. While the poverty rate declined slightly in 1986, it remained at an unusually high level for the fourth year of an economic recovery, and minority poverty rates remain far higher than those of the general population. The poor grew poorer in 1986, and the gap between rich and poor families--and between rich and middle class families as well--reached its widest point in at least 40 years. The data show that 13.6 percent of Americans were poor in 1986, a modest improvement over the 14 percent poverty rate for 1985. However, the 1986 poverty rate was higher than that for 1977 and 1980, although unemployment was at nearly identical levels in all three years. Some 41.5 percent of all poor people aged 15 and over  worked in 1986, equal to the highest percentage since 1968. While poverty among children edged down from 1985 to 1986, it remains far above the levels of the 1970s. Poverty rates remain particularly high for minority children. The poverty rate for the elderly was 12.4 percent in 1986, the same level as in 1984 and marginally below the 12.6 percent of 1985. The 1986 Black poverty rate was slightly lower than that in 1985, but the number of Blacks living in poverty increased. The Hispanic poverty rate showed a more significant decline from 1985, but this masks the longer trend in which Hispanic poverty rates have been rising. Poverty measures that include the value of non-cash benefits demonstrate that poverty has risen much faster in recent years than the official measure of poverty  indicate. Eight graphs and tables are included. (KH)",

        "description":"Determining how many students drop out of school and why they leave is not easy. The definition of a &quot;dropout&quot; varies from school district to school district, and the mobility of students makes counting them accurately nearly impossible. In an effort to define dropouts in a way that can be applied uniformly across the country, a checklist has been devised which specifies eight common categories of students who can be described as dropouts. Equally important, specifications are given for students who should not be considered dropouts, such as truants, transferees, and returnees. Large margins of error occur in the national dropout rate because of widely varying ways of calculating dropout data. It is necessary to accept and apply uniform methods of defining dropouts and  determining the dropout rate. Another area of concern is the identification and monitoring of students who are most at risk of dropping out of school. Offering these students special programs early in their school careers has proven helpful. Monitoring in terms of attendance, testing, and educational history will help to ensure positive progress for students as they proceed through school. Effective systems for identifying dropouts and at risk students are necessary for the accurate measurement of national educational progress. (VM)",

        "description":"Schools have been accused of being insensitive to students' cultural backgrounds, and thus of failing to serve some populations because instruction and curricula are designed for middle class children. But teachers should be cautious about applying the findings of ethnographic studies which address this problem. Although ethnographic studies sometimes reveal ways in which cultural incongruity contributes to inequity, the existing research does not imply that teachers should always promote cultural congruity. For example, Au and Jordan's well-known study demonstrates how cultural differences hindered the learning of Hawaiian students, and how the improvement of classroom communication fit better with student background increased learning. But it is difficult to extract  implications for preservice teachers from this study, and there is apparently no straightforward link between research studies and teachers' classroom practice. Furthermore, there are substantial costs in making curricula continuous with students' everyday lives. The examination of analytic studies of everyday experience, learning theory, and empirical studies in science education reveals that attempts to connect curricula to everyday life can impede students' understanding of disciplinary concepts and may restrict their range of vision. Ethnographic studies can have value in helping future teachers to reflect on how their actions are culturally influenced and how individual differences do not imply deficiencies, but prospective teachers need intellectual tools and adequate practice to  profit from ethnographic research.

Chapter 2 presents the conceptual framework and the methodology used to collect information. Chapter 3 examines the composition of chapter 1 budgets and the impact of changes in Chapter 1 allocations on the portion of the budget devoted to instruction and administration. Chapter 4 describes the mechanisms that school districts use to determine the breadth and intensity of Chapter 1  instructional services. Chapter 5 shows how districts distribute resources across Chapter 1 schools and relates the distribution of Chapter 1 resources to the economic and educational characteristics of participating schools. Chapter 6 describes how districts allocate Chapter 1 resources to private schools and the impact of the Felton decision, prohibiting delivery of chapter 1 services on the premises of religiously-affiliated nonpublic schools, on these policies. Chapter 7 examines the interaction of Chapter 1 and other special needs programs. Chapter 8 contains the major conclusions of the study and implications of the study's findings for federal policy.

Chapter 5 examines the effects of state administration on compliance and program improvement and the contributions of Chapter 1 administration to program operation. Chapter 6  discusses trends in state Chapter 1 administration and possible options for Federal action. The major conclusion is that, since the law went into effect, state administrative structures have not been transformed, but considerable differences between states are seen, and emphases and activities are changing. By and large, states have not shifted from regulatory compliance to quality programming. Chapter 1 school and student selection requirements are reportedly well-implemented in school districts. The connection between administrative requirements and the quality of Chapter 1 programs has not been established and the contributions of evaluation and parent involvement requirements to Chapter 1 programming depend in large part on district influences.

Specific areas of interest included using a videocassette recorder (VCR) as a supplemental delivery system, using home video equipment to develop instructional units through the formative evaluation stage, and producing instructional materials and strategies that were based on an analysis of the limited English proficient (LEP) students' needs, interests, and adulthood. Generally, the project team found that (1) the use of the low-cost VCR technology is feasible; (2) incremental success rates and motivational response rates were much higher than expected and teacher response was extremely  favorable; (3) the demand by students and teachers generated by this pilot project for more tapes clearly indicates that it would be possible to implement this instructional strategy; and (4) in the opinion of the team, tape losses were minimal and would be far less in the more structured custody system of established course offerings and classes. Despite the success of the curriculum content and instructional strategy as measured by student and teacher response, analysis of the project product suggests that in the areas of linguistics and student orientation this project is only the gateway to quality, motivating, individualized, language instruction.

The program served 175 adult men and women from Alachua and Bradford counties who wanted to develop a career, re-enter the work force, or change careers. Services offered to single parents and homemakers by the program included vocational and career assessment, employability skills classes, counseling and support groups, job search and job retention activities, and information on available community resources. Evaluations of the program completed by those who used the services indicated that the program met or exceeded their expectations. Many of the graduates have implemented the goals they set for themselves in class and  are quite satisfied with the outlook for their future. The program found an unmet need in the counties of Alachua and Bradford and continued to work hard to alert those eligible persons to the availability of the services. Staff attempted to meet participants' needs by designing classes around their schedules and by developing information to assist them in making sound career decisions. Recommendations for future programs include more staff time in follow-up activities as the graduate pool grows larger, employability skills classes offered at different times of the day, and more outreach activities into the rural areas. These recommendations will require a larger budget to implement. (Eighteen appendices comprise three-quarters of the document and contain the forms used in the program.)  (Author/KC)",

        "description":"The Single Teen Parent Program conducted by the Orange County, Florida, Public Schools, was designed to help single teen parents acquire marketable skills and jobs in order to head independent family units. The parents served were between the ages of 16 and 20 and either had a high school diploma or had passed the General Educational Development (GED) test. The Single Teen Parent Program made 100 contacts with students, has 12 students pre-enrolled, and provided transportation, day care, and tuition assistance to students who otherwise would have been unable to attend school. Students received training in competency-based vocational programs of the Orange County Public Schools, job placement assistance, and supportive services. To provide these services, the coordinators had to  research and identify existing supplemental programs and their eligibility requirements. The coordinators also had to design a system of recordkeeping, forms for referral, and vouchers for identifying qualified students. Special documents were developed to implement the project objectives and serve the single teen parents. Formal counseling sessions were used to help students identify appropriate training programs, assist students with problems of daily living, and encourage self-management and decision-making skills. Recommendations were made for more vocational evaluation and for bolstering students' self-esteem before placing them in training programs, especially in nontraditional areas. (Thirteen appendixes comprise three-quarters of the document and contain the forms developed for  and used in the program.) (Author/KC)",

        "description":"The purpose of a project was to work toward the reduction of sex bias and sex-role stereotyping in vocational education programs in the technical and skill centers in Dade County, Florida. To accomplish this goal, vocational teachers, counselors, and students attended inservice workshops focusing on equity issues. The project provided resources and newsletters that vocational staff might use to encourage students to pursue courses and careers in nontraditional occupations. Further, assessment instruments were developed and used to assess the technical and skill centers' activities for promoting equity. As a result, vocational students expressed a high degree of receptivity to pursuing nontraditional programs and careers. It was also found that although the targeted populations  (vocational centers) had not made a concerted effort to focus on equity, attention had been given to reducing sex bias and sex stereotyping in their schools. After receiving technical assistance from the Dade County Office of Vocational, Adult, and Community Education, each center developed an action plan to recruit and retain students into nontraditional programs. (The brief project report is followed by appendices, including sex equity workshop materials, a newsletter update, forms for developing a sex equity improvement plan, two brochures on nontraditional careers, a teacher inservice education component, and a project status report and management plan.)

The first objective was to recruit 60 displaced homemakers and high school women and to inform them about the advantages of technological careers. Thirty-two displaced homemakers and 187 high school women attended seminars on nontraditional careers. To encourage 60 displaced homemakers and high school women to train for nontraditional and technological careers was the second objective. It was achieved through field trips by displaced homemakers to the Orlando Vocational Technical Center, where the women toured technical departments and role models made presentations to a total of  100 displaced homemaker classes and high school women. The third objective was to encourage employers to hire women in nontraditional fields. Presentations explaining the advantages of hiring women in nontraditional fields were made to three women's networks: Women in Management, Black Women in Management, and Women Business Owners. The project reached a total of 319 displaced homemakers and high school women. Participant response was positive. The exposure to a vocational technical center was very popular, and the chance to observe and talk to women engaged in training was significant to the displaced homemakers. (KC)",

One contribution educational institutions can make to independent learners is to teach them the processes by which to gain access to and make judgments about the information that is created and stored in the various subject matter disciplines. People who are classified as independent learners complain that information packaged into courses may be inappropriate--more or less than is needed or in more or less detail than is needed. Courses are an inefficient use of the independent learner's time, so he/she seeks alternative means of access to the needed information. To meet the  independent learner half-way, the subject matter specialist can have at least three different functions: organize information in ways appropriate for each of the alternative means for its dissemination; teach how the subject matter is organized, how to gain access to it, and how to make judgments about its value; and perform a translator function to assist learners in their efforts to apply the information in their particular contexts.

Research has confirmed that aggressive prevention and screening programs can be, and indeed are, effective in limiting the number and severity of cancer cases. Primary prevention and early detection programs are two important ways of combatting cancer. Primary prevention programs can be aimed at reducing smoking, improving diet, and reducing exposure to occupational hazards. Early detection programs could concentrate on screening for breast, colorectal, uterine, and/or lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute has encouraged industry to offer health promotion  programs and screening programs to employees, collaborate with employee groups to promote worksite health promotion programs, monitor employee use of measures to prevent exposure to carcinogens in the workplace, offer on-site food options congruent with cancer prevention, and develop insurance policies that reward risk-avoidance behaviors.

        "description":"Alcohol and drug abuse have serious physical, psychological, and social consequences, and employees who abuse alcohol and/or drugs ultimately reduce their companies' profits. Employee substance abuse leads to reduced productivity as well as to increased absenteeism, health care and health insurance costs, and liability claims against employers of persons who abuse substances. Programs to prevent substance abuse can take one of three forms. Primary prevention programs focus on changes in the environment or anticipatory education to obviate problems that are as yet undiscernible (for example, programs on the hazards of drinking and driving or policies requiring warning labels on liquor bottles). Secondary prevention involves efforts to identify and change established health risks  before these risks have done irreversible harm (for example, mandatory educational programs for drivers arrested while intoxicated). Tertiary prevention programs occur at a late stage and are palliative in orientation (that is, they are a form of treatment that is geared toward preventing further harm). Possible types of primary and secondary prevention efforts can include educational and awareness activities, company policies to prevent alcohol and drug abuse (such as drug screening and drug searches), and early problem identification and referral. (Eight examples of companies that have developed successful drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs are included in this document.) (MN)",

Employee leaders can become involved in worksite wellness programs in a number of ways,  including committees, employee associations, and support and other special groups. They can also work with programs' teachers and assistants and those individuals responsible for planning and building worksite wellness program facilities, and they can take an active part in the coordination and communication processes entailed in developing and implementing a worksite wellness program. Organizational development research has revealed a number of societal, leadership, and management trends that have confirmed the feasibility of using employee leaders to plan and conduct worksite wellness programs.

The \"healthy corporation\" is both a goal and a comprehensive attitude about organizational life and about the factors the affect organizational health and, ultimately, organizational profitability. The work environment, employee health, and the larger environment all have an effect on employee health and organizational profits. Many factors can have a negative impact on organizational health, including a negative physical environment, work overload (too much work with inadequate resources), repetitious or monotonous work, shift work, inadequate ventilation, the necessity of spending long periods of time at  video display terminals, and job-related stress. Possible approaches to alleviating the negative impact of these factors include job redesign, redesign of physical settings, improvement of hygiene and safety programs, and consideration of stress management techniques when defining work tasks. When employees feel a lack of control over their jobs and conditions or an inability to participate in managerial decisions, they are more likely to feel undue stress and be subject to its adverse effects. Other sources of job-related stress include tense work relationships, lack of career progression, unclear work roles, poorly managed change, and conflicts between work and family or work and leisure. By reexamining existing personnel policies and attempting to expand employees' work options,  companies can do much to alleviate these sources of stress and thus enhance organizational health and profitability.

        "description":"The use of incentives by businesses is a well-accepted pattern of management-employee collaboration. Increasingly, U.S. businesses are using incentives to encourage employees to stay healthy. Research in the field of behavior modification indicates that positive reinforcement, negative consequences and restrictions, and feedback have great potential as strategies for encouraging employees to stay healthy. Although many program planners feel that cash is the strongest motivator, other companies have achieved success in motivating employees by offering noncash positive incentives, negative incentives, and social support. Location, convenience, and cost have also been found to be important in encouraging employees to make long-term health changes. Some possible types of incentives  to encourage healthy life-styles in businesses are corporate policies and practices, facilities and equipment, personal recognition, tangible rewards, teams and competitions, and health care benefits. Whatever the incentive used, incentive programs have had the greatest impact when they include rewards for employees who are already healthy as well as those employees who wish to make changes in their health practice patterns. Incentives are not effective if they are viewed as coercive or manipulative. Small, visible, quickly earned rewards seem to encourage people to take the first steps in health promotion and can be effective when starting a program or when attempting to increase participation rates.

The workplace offers several advantages as a site for nutrition education.

Depending on the individual company and its needs, company nutrition programs can focus on any one  or a combination of several or all of the following: cafeteria or point-of-purchase nutrition education, weight control, cholesterol reduction, programs for pregnant or lactating women, and nutrition education activities.

        "description":"Company-sponsored wellness programs are particularly important for older employees inasmuch as they are at greater risk of disease and disability than are their younger counterparts and their health care and health insurance costs are generally higher. As the cost of retirement benefits rises, wellness programs for retirees are becoming increasingly important. Wellness programs intended for older workers and retirees may focus on one or more of the following: medical screenings, health information, health classes and seminars, and exercise and fitness programs. Physician involvement and support, spouse eligibility, focus on risk factors, emphasis on managing chronic illness, knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff, recognition of individual achievement, focus on retirement planning  or on a retiree club, and caution in using an age focus are all factors that have been found to be associated with program success. Although worksite wellness programs have not traditionally focused on older workers or retirees, companies that have instituted such programs have found them worthwhile for their cost-effectiveness and their inherent social value. Wellness programs for older and retired employees can be especially effective when companies recognize the varied abilities and interests of retirees of different ages and when programs are designed with consideration for such barriers as access to programming, legal liability, difficulty in effecting behavioral change, and lack of consensus about effective interventions.

The cost-effectiveness of such programs and the resulting reduction in employees' absenteeism rates and medical and health care costs have been well documented. In addition, many states either already have or are in the process of passing legislation offering incentives for employer-sponsored physical fitness programs. Companies desiring to develop their own worksite physical fitness programs need to recognize the need for screening procedures to determine employees' coronary risk factors and exercise tolerance levels. Staff selection, adequate liability protection, and the need for program  evaluation are other important issues to consider. Company-sponsored worksite physical fitness programs vary widely from the standpoint of available facilities, activities offered, target audience, participation rates, cost to employees, and incentives for participation. In the past, most worksite physical fitness programs concentrated almost exclusively on programs for top executives and on exercise and physical fitness; as the cost-effectiveness of keeping employees physically fit become better known, however, more companies are making their programs available to more of their employees and are combining exercise and with other self-help programs.

Workplace programs to encourage employees to wear safety belts can thus help employers reduce traffic accident-related losses of work time and can substantially reduce the medical costs incurred when employees are involved in traffic accidents. Four methods have been effective in increasing safety belt use: laws, policies requiring usage, incentives, and education/information. A number of companies have been quite successful in combining education and incentives to increase safety belt use among their employees. The following factors have been especially important to program success: a strong and active  commitment to increasing safety belt use on the part of management, a clearly defined and well-enforced policy of required safety belt use on the job, positive incentives for employee safety belt use, and an ongoing personalized safety education and training program for all employees that emphasizes the need for and benefits of using safety belts. Systematic recordkeeping of motor vehicle accidents in which safety belts were and were not in use, ongoing program promotions, and outreach efforts to encourage safety belt use among employees' families and friends have also been effective.

Small businesses can encourage wellness among their employees in the following ways: formulation of policies and implementation of practices aimed at supporting wellness, provision of a supportive physical environment, development of programs to educate  employees and their families about the benefits of wellness, provision of small classes, development of incentives (monetary or tangible) for staying healthy, and provision of screening examinations and counseling services.

Limiting or banning smoking helps create a safe and healthy workplace and may reduce direct health care costs, health and life insurance costs, employee absenteeism, costs associated with maintaining facilities and equipment, and the risk of fires. There is an increasing body of court cases and legal opinions indicating that employees have a common law right to a smoke-free work environment, that employers must accept some responsibility for discomfort and illness caused to employees by smoke in the workplace, and that employers are within their legal rights in banning smoking in the workplace and hiring only nonsmokers. Smoking  policies can vary widely from company to company. Generally speaking, however, smoking policies generally have one or more of the following purposes: to protect equipment or property, to comply with laws or regulations, to ban smoking in specific areas, to ban smoking except in designated areas, to ban smoking entirely throughout an organization, or to preclude the hiring of smokers.

A brief overview of the relationship of stress to health and personal style follows. The subsequent discussion of the relationship between stress and work focuses on these topics: work contributes to stress; stress affects work performance; stress raises legal and medical issues; stress affects the business, itself; business pays many costs associated with stress; and family stress and work stress interact. Design of worksite stress management programs (WSMPs) is considered in terms of three basic elements: techniques for managing stress, delivery formats, and basic skills taught. In addition to highlighting reasons why the programs are implemented, the section on  implementation describes four categories of WSMPs: awareness building, skills building classes, counseling, and organizational change. Summaries of several studies on the impact of WSMPs are provided. The paper concludes with examples of 10 WSMPs implemented by companies. Company name and address, contact person, and telephone number are given. (YLB)",

An overview of unions' historical concern for worker health serves as an introduction to consideration of the labor movement's current involvement in employee health. A look at labor's views of health promotion follows. Both labor's concerns and labor's hope for health promotion are addressed. Recommendations are made for involving unions in health promotion, and results of studies of the extent of union involvement in health promotion programs are provided. A prognosis is made regarding the future of union-based health promotion programs. The paper concludes with 11 examples of international, national, and  local union health promotion programs.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine how job clubs help two-year college students with learning disabilities improve their job-seeking skills and knowledge of the world of work in preparation for making a successful transition from school to work. The approach was based on a previous demonstration project in which job clubs showed promising results for students with a spectrum of disabilities. The job clubs were conducted at six two-year colleges throughout the country. Researchers worked with the projects to facilitate the clubs and to report on activities and outcomes. In all, 81 students participated in the 6 clubs, and 62 students completed the job club experience. Job clubs made use of a syllabus of activities, handouts, evaluation instruments, and other resources provided or  suggested by the researchers. Results showed that the job club participants increased their job-seeking skills and knowledge, although job club participation had less effect on students' employment. An important finding was that students with learning disabilities cannot be hurried through job club activities if they are expected to retain the information and develop the skills appropriately. Many of the students have unrealistic career goals that must be addressed, and many also need extra help and support to overcome self-esteem and social skills problems. Some students require continual encouragement by the coordinators to participate in the group process. Despite these limitations, job clubs were recommended by the researchers to help students with learning disabilities, provided they  address the special needs of these students. Five appendices include: (1) a pilot job club syllabus for students with learning disabilities, 1987; (2) resource and referral materials; (3) 1987 job club instruments; (4) a list of job club organization workshop participants; and (5) case study reports from each site. Four figures and 13 tables are also included. (KC)",

This study focused on the methods used by people to obtain jobs. It examined the hypothesis that informal job-seeking methods are more likely to lead to employment and that most jobs are obtained without prior knowledge of the vacancy. The data for the study were derived from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' monthly labour force survey of households (published and unpublished data). In the 12 months from July 1985 to June 1986, some 1.6 million individuals had started a new job. At least 29 percent of the jobs resulted from approaches made without prior knowledge that the job was available. Friends and relatives accounted  for some 17 percent of placements, and in 20 percent of cases, the employer approached the job seeker, bringing the proportion of informal methods to at least 66 percent. There were statistically significant differences between employed and unemployed job seekers in approaches to or from employers. Occupational, age, and seasonal differences also were evident.

These movements result in unnecessary duplication and use of educational resources and can cause students to lose valuable time, effort, and motivation. To interrelate secondary and postsecondary vocational education programs, a model has been constructed that is comprehensive in nature and designed to serve four specific student groups. The groups are students with secondary training, students with secondary training and work experience, students with only work experience, and students with informal training or undocumented training--in regard to their proposed postsecondary field of study. Subsequent to classification, a three-stage process  enables students to receive appropriate placement commensurate with previous experiences. These stages sequentially include screening, testing, and awarding of credit. The articulation process concludes with awarding of credit. Students then have the option to continue with the next course or complete the program. To ensure program quality, all postsecondary students are required to pass an Occupational Competency Test as a certification examination prior to graduation. (YLB)",

Thirty-three articles relating to self-evaluation of vocational interests were located through manual and computer searches of the psychological literature. The median values of 24 rank correlations derived from 11 idiographic studies ranged from 0.12 to 0.77. There was considerable variation in the individual's ability to estimate his/her own interests. Nomothetic studies using univariate statistics other than the product-moment correlation were considered as a discrete group. A meta-analysis procedure was used with 13 separate nomothetic studies (N= 3336) reporting 309 product-moment correlations. Correlations ranged from -0.05 to 0.89  with a mean of 0.48, and around 99 percent were positive. Based on the Schmidt-Hunter formulas, 13.1 of the observed variance was accounted for by reference to the expected variance. It was concluded that there were true differences in effect sizes across studies. Results indicated significant differences in the correlations depending on which inventory was used, but they did not support any proposed influence of vocational interest areas. (Author)",

However, evaluations can be conducted by an auditing approach. The auditing approach to evaluating T & D offers three advantages. Auditing is quicker and less expensive than traditional methods, and it uses a format that is easily understood by managers. Auditing can be used to pinpoint areas where further examination is warranted. Repeated auditing also serves as an incentive for producing high quality T & D efforts. One form of T & D auditing is a third-party evaluation based on critical questions and samples of information that fall into five categories: compliance, process, operations/financial, trainees, and business results. The audit  process requires six steps: (1) establish objectives for each category of the audit; (2) describe what the auditor expects to find; (3) determine data collection procedures; (4) collect data samples; (5) report what was found in relation to expectations; and (6) write and report conclusions. Auditing's greatest value to the organization is in providing an unbiased third-party view of how, when, and where T & D contributes to the organization.

        "description":"Adult learners require teaching strategies that reflect their sociological and psychological characteristics. Adults can be defined, according to Babcock, as either traditional or nontraditional learners, with nontraditional students being those attending college after age 22. The needs of these learners vary depending upon their age, with older students being less available, more independent, more motivated, less flexible, more responsible, more learning focused, more experienced, and exhibiting less socialization expectation and more mutuality with the instructor. Intellectually, nontraditional students demonstrate lower abstract reasoning, higher knowledge, lower complex data organization, lower short-term memory, higher long-term memory, and equivalent ability to learn when  compared to traditional students. The adult learner's needs and characteristics mandate a unique science of teaching--andragogy. Since the adult learner is independent and self-directed, educational situations involving the student in a role of dependency, captivity, and/or unquestioning compliance result in resentment and resistance. Learning strategies that use student input, such as laboratory experiments, discussions, problem-solving cases, and field experiences, are recommended. Since the adult learner is ready to learn when the content meets perceived needs, learning programs should be organized around life-application categories. Finally, as the adult learner is oriented to learning here and now, immediate application of new skills is necessary. (Two learning reinforcement  strategies are included in this document.) (KC)",

In the first section of the paper, learning and memory are discussed and factors needed for adults to learn the hows and whys of adult motivation are then discussed. The paper next covers the setting of adult learning and the differences between short-term and long-term memory. Activities by which teachers of adults can facilitate the retention and transfer of learning are listed and explained, and techniques suggested by some researchers are offered. Finally, the paper presents lists of teaching strategies and explores the differences between adult and younger learners as advanced in the literature. (KC)",

        "description":"This paper presents an overview of the need for adult education, surveys the theory behind adult education, discusses the reasons why adults do not participate in adult education, and outlines marketing strategies that may induce adults to participate in greater numbers. The first part of the paper cites the need for educational reform, noting that many workers are untrained for the jobs that society has to offer and that millions of illiterate students are graduating from high school. It is suggested that adult education is more important than ever for these students as well as for those bright students who obtain college degrees but find little opportunity for jobs. In the next section of the paper, adult education theory is reviewed, particularly the ideas of Malcolm Knowles,  and eight principles of adult learning are listed. Following this review is an examination of the reasons why adults participate in adult education and the factors (situational, institutional, and dispositional) that prevent them from participating. Finally, it is suggested that adult education providers should do market research in order to determine the needs of their potential clients and set up programs that serve those needs. Various types of recruitment strategies are examined and listed both in order of effectiveness and in order of use. The paper concludes with some questions about adult education in West Virginia and reasons why adult education is very much needed to help people improve their lives. (KC)",

        "description":"The Summer Youth Employment and Training Programs funded by the Job Training Partnership Act were reviewed to determine how the various service delivery areas (SDAs) planned to assess and improve the reading and mathematics skills of participants. Telephone interviews with program officials at 200 randomly selected SDAs found that local school districts were the primary sources of advice in developing 1987 remediation plans for 41 percent of the SDAs and provided some assistance to 72 percent of them. SDAs cited a wide range of factors as their biggest problem in developing remediating plans, such as uncertainty about funding and difficulty in obtaining school records. The SDAs planned to use school records as well as tests that they administered to assess youths' reading and  mathematics skills. However, almost one-third of the SDAs planned to provide remediation only to students rather than to dropouts or high school graduates. The survey results indicated that more youths will receive remediation in 1987, and more Title II-B funds will be spent to provide it. SDAs expect to provide remediation in about the same way in 1987 as in 1986, usually through local school districts. Youths will have about 12 hours of remediation and 20 hours of work per week. Lecture/discussion and individual instruction are popular approaches. Most SDA officers felt that the remedial instruction requirement was appropriate, although it would cause reduction in other areas of the program. Four appendices include: (1) Service Delivery Areas Surveyed by GAO; (2) GAO's Survey, Sampling,  and Data Verification Methodology; (3) Summary of Responses in GAO Telephone Interviews; and (4) Comments from the Department of Labor.

        "description":"This is the final report in a series issued to assist Congress in assessing the problems of worker dislocation and employer practices related to advance notice and assistance provided to workers. A national survey of 2,600 business establishments was conducted to determine: (1) the extent of business closures and permanent layoffs between January 1983 and December 1984; (2) the length of advance notice provided to affected workers; and (3) the assistance offered to dislocated workers by their employers. The study found that in 1983 and 1984, closures and permanent layoffs at about 16,200 establishments having 50 or more employees resulted in the dislocation of 1.3 million workers. Sixty percent of the closures and layoffs occurred in the manufacturing sector, and one-third of the  closures and layoffs occurred in industries adversely affected by foreign competition. However, a quarter million workers were also dislocated from the fast-growing service sector. Few employers provided advance notice adequate to establish reemployment assistance programs; the median length of notice provided to workers was seven days. About one-third of establishments provided no notice before employment was terminated. About one in seven employers offered workers a comprehensive assistance package composed of the most frequently cited worker assistance measures--income maintenance, continued health insurance coverage, counseling, and job search assistance, but only 5 percent combined such assistance with more than 30 days' advance notice. The proposals pending before the Congress would  expand assistance to dislocated workers. Seven appendices include: (1) Methodology and Sampling; (2) Analysis of Dun and Bradstreet Database Comparison; (3) Comparison of GAO and BLS Dislocated Worker Estimates; (4) List of Specific Industries within the Manufacturing, Trade, Service, and Other Industrial Sectors; (5) Definition of High Technology Industries; (6)) List of States in Nine Regions; and (7) Tables Supporting Bar Graphs in Report Text and Supplementary Tables.

The first section reviews the sources of increased demands for accountability in TAFE (societal, economic, government, and legislative sources) and examines various management systems that could be used to meet increased demands for accountability (program budgeting, program evaluation, management information systems, management procedures, and corporate planning). The first section concludes with an examination of the Swedish model for self-evaluation. The second part of the report describes the following aspects of the attempt in New South Wales, Australia, to increase accountability by using a  corporate planning-based approach in which evaluation is a major component in providing accountability and maintaining quality of educational provision. The following topics are covered: the diversity and scope of TAFE in New South Wales, corporate planning as a management tool, strategic planning (departmental, college/school, and servicing unit strategic plans), staff participation in strategic planning, action or operational planning, evaluation and monitoring, performance indicators and their interpretation, evaluation procedures for program monitoring, comprehensive audits and program evaluation activities, establishment of a directorate of audit and review, program performance evaluation plans, planning and evaluation support to managers, and future directions.

        "description":"A study examined the difficulties encountered by first-year, part-time Technical and Further Education (TAFE) students that cause them to consider withdrawing from, and in many cases, dropping out of their TAFE programs. Questionnaires were administered to 4,150 early withdrawers (persons who dropped out between January 1 and May 16, 1986), 2,940 later withdrawers (those who dropped out between May 17 and October 30, 1986), and 1,405 program persisters (persons still in the program as of October 31, 1986). Of those variables that affected 17 percent or more of the respondents, six could be classified as academic, four as environmental, one as a background variable, and one as a defining variable. The variables that were most likely to result in a decision to drop out were as  follows: inability to resolve the pressures from mixing the demands of home, work, and study; difficulties in establishing a study routine; difficulties in organizing study time; teaching methods that did not stimulate interest; too much difficulty in meeting family commitments; an expansion of career options by virtue of only taking part of a course (thus obviating the need to complete a course); impossibility of home study because of home jobs; inadequate study skills; inability to cope with both work and study; failure to find a course interesting; and excessive demands imposed by after-work travel to college. (Appendixes include the questionnaires for early and later withdrawers and for program completers, a list of the liaison researchers who participated in the study, and the  original and followup letters that were sent to early withdrawers.)

        "description":"A study examined ways in which Technical and Further Education (TAFE) services might be delivered to persons living in outlying areas of Australia. The study concentrated on the tristate area served by the Broken Hill, Riverland, and Sunraysia colleges. The following means of providing TAFE services were studied: self-study centers, residential facilities at TAFE colleges, branch campuses at centers away from a principal college campus, mobile teaching units, distance education, telecommunication links, and radio and television (including satellite transmission). The study resulted in series of recommendations pertaining to 14 aspects of improving services to residents of remote areas. It was concluded that (1) for purposes of providing TAFE services, the three colleges studied  should be treated as a single unit; (2) an area council be established to oversee a rolling triennial plan for TAFE services in the tristate area; and (3) tertiary counseling and credit transfer information services should be established. It was also recommended that cooperation regarding the use of college facilities be expanded, study centers be established, distance education services be expanded, and telematics be given greater emphasis. (Appendixes contain data on course provision and enrollments, additional statistical information, lists of some possibilities for tele-education with equipment required for networking and courses available through external studies, a statement of the duties of a radio education officer, and the budget of the Northern Territory External Studies Centre.

        "description":"A study examined the overall structure of Australia's engineering technical work force, the relationships between occupations in each branch and level of the engineering work force, and the job functions of each occupational cluster. The primary purpose of the study was to gather data to assist Technical and Further Education (TAFE) curriculum planners and planners working with other education and training bodies. The analysis was based on two national surveys. The first survey, which was intended to collect general information on the number of workers in each occupational level and branch of engineering, involved a net sample of 1,089 government and industry organizations and 1,090 TAFE and college of advanced education students. The second survey (of a net sample of 1,230  engineering technical workers from all of Australia's states and territories) examined workers' background characteristics and detailed each respondent's job functions. Cluster analysis sorts were carried out by using a statistical rather than a judgmental process, and a cluster diagram was developed after each sorting procedure. Ninety-nine primary clusters were identified. These primary clusters were merged into four major clusters given the following designations: engineering systems and administration (438 respondents), civil engineering and surveying (318 respondents), drafting and design (123 respondents), and electrical and electronic engineering (188 respondents). Job function profiles and background characteristics (including average age, salary, highest education, and proportion  of females) were compiled for each cluster. (MN)",

        "description":"A pilot study assessed the effectiveness of two selection profiles that were designed to evaluate candidates for admission into prevocational hairdressing and automotive mechanics programs. The selection profile, which was developed by the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) National Centre for Research and Development, consisted of the following measures: tests of basic mathematics and reading comprehension, a trainability test (a practical test specific to the relevant trade and designed to measure aptitude for training), a school statement on achievement and attitudes, biographical data and a personal statement from the applicant, and an interview. Thus, the profile measured both aptitude and motivation. The profile was found to be satisfactory from the standpoint of its  validity, reliability, and utility. It was decided, however, that a longitudinal study of the profile approach should be negotiated with one or more TAFE authorities so as to gain a clearer understanding of the profile's long-term validity and that a cost-benefit study comparing the existing student selection system and the profile approach be conducted. It was also recommended that any measures developed for off- and on-the-job performance be based on objectives derived from a thorough occupational analysis of the job in question and should take account of the occasion and circumstances in which the performance is expected to be demonstrated. Copies of the mathematics, reading comprehension, and trainability tests; the school and personal biographical statement forms; interview schedules  and rating sheets; a note on the correlation study; and a description of the criteria for assessing hairdressing students are appended.

        "description":"A study examined ways in which experienced, full-time Technical and Further Education (TAFE) lecturers can regularly update their technical knowledge and skills, especially in reference to the rapid technological changes occurring in industry and commerce. The research was conducted at four levels; three surveys were conducted. In the first, registrars of 19 universities and 15 colleges of advanced education were surveyed about any courses offered by their institutions that could be suitable for full-time TAFE college lecturers. The second survey requested information about continuing education available through Australia's TAFE professional development units, and in the third survey, executive officers of national industry training committees were asked to give their opinions on  ways in which TAFE lecturers could regularly update their technical knowledge and skills. The survey responses indicated that there is an urgent need for continuing education programs that would enable lecturers to keep abreast of technological changes and that would bring lecturers into close contact with industry and business. At the time of the study, higher education was doing little to meet the continuing education needs of TAFE lecturers, and in-house, inservice courses were the most common method of providing continuing education to TAFE lecturers. Two ways of meeting professional development needs mentioned were (1) providing small research and development grants to TAFE colleges for those industrial and commercial subject areas represented in the colleges and (2) releasing  lecturers so that they can spend regular periods in industry or business settings. The three questionnaires and a project brief are appended. (MN)",

The aims of the project were as follows: to establish an information network of practitioners working within Australia's Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system who have an interest in using computer-assisted learning in basic adult education; to collate a human resources directory and a register of computer hardware and software materials presently in use at TAFE institutions throughout Australia; to prepare and disseminate an information bulletin/newsletter that would assist practitioners in using computer-assisted learning in basic adult education; and to select and evaluate computer software packages presently in use in basic adult education throughout Australia. After  having accomplished the first two project objectives, the project team developed the following recommendations for staff and students involved in basic adult education programs into which computer-assisted learning is being introduced: teachers and learners should spend time becoming familiar with the particular hardware being used; program managers should be sure that stand-alone packages are purchased along with hardware; authoring packages should only be considered if extensive teacher inservice and student workshops are provided; and managers should be prepared to make additional resources available to system operators once they have become well advanced.

        "description":"The Alberta Vocational Centre (AVC) Transitional Vocational (T-V) Program, in Edmonton, began in 1982. The program currently employs six instructors to provide a postsecondary employment-oriented program for mildly mentally disabled adults. The yearlong program is offered in two sessions and has an approximate enrollment of 30 incoming students and 12-18 outgoing students in each session. Students are assessed at the Goodwill Rehabilitation Society and then assigned either to a regular class or a differentiated class incorporating more experiential learning and group instruction. An evaluation of the program was conducted in January-April 1987 by a telephone survey of 1982-1985 graduates of the program. Additional information was obtained and comparisons made from an earlier  study. Some of the conclusions drawn were the following: (1) the T-V gender ratios are approximately equal; (2) T-V graduates are younger than the AVC's regular students; (3) T-V graduates of both genders averaged 71 on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R); (4) T-V graduates were about as likely to be employed as regular AVC graduates (56 to 63 percent); (5) changing jobs is three times more common among T-V graduates than among graduates of other AVC programs; (6) T-V graduates earn less than AVC graduates, and females earn less than males; (7) WAIS-R scores are not related to employability, although age may be related and gender probably is related; (8) T-V graduates work at some time after graduation, males more so than females; (9) most T-V graduates like their jobs  (men less than women) and are satisfied with their income (women less than men); (10) most T-V graduates want to work now and/or expect to be working in the future; and (11) male T-V graduates are initially, and remain, more dependent on family for residence and employment than females.

Data were gathered through the fourth wave topical module to the 1984 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, conducted from September through December of 1984. The prevalence of pension coverage among different segments of the population, the reliance on employee-directed retirement plans, and differences in the level of economic well-being of today's retirees are some of the topics discussed in this report. Some highlights of the report are the following: (1) two-thirds of the nation's wage and salary workers, aged 25 and over, were covered by employer-sponsored public and private pensions; (2) about 90 percent of  workers in firms with 1,000 or more employees were covered by pension plans, compared with one-quarter of those in firms with fewer than 25 employees; (3) pension coverage ranged from only 38 percent of workers with monthly earnings under $500 to 84 percent of those earning $2,000 or more; (4) about one-fifth of wage and salary workers aged 25 or over had individual retirement accounts (IRAs), whereas only 12 percent of workers earning under $1,000 monthly participated in an IRA; (5) the average monthly pension for the 11.5 million retirees receiving a pension was $570, and combined Social Security and pension income brought the average to $930; and (6) the 6.7 million retirees who had pensions with cost-of-living adjustment provisions had average pensions nearly 80 percent higher than  retirees with no cost-of-living provisions.

The LMIPR found that there are 79 literacy-related programs administered by 14 federal agencies and that $347.6 million was spent for adult literacy activities in fiscal year (FY) 1985. The committee staff telephoned the program directors of the 79 programs that the LMIPR listed as having literacy-related activities for adults and contacted 20 randomly selected state directors to verify program content and dollar figures reported by the LMIPR. Approximately 90 percent of the officials contacted said that they had not been asked for their input when the LMIPR was  being prepared. Some of the major findings of the staff study were as follows: (1) of the 79 programs in 14 federal agencies that were identified in the LMIPR as conducting literacy-related activities for adults, only 10 (13 percent of the program), in 5 federal agencies, were definitely conducting literacy activities, and 38 (48 percent) of the programs were not conducting adult literacy activities; (2) several programs receive no funding for literacy activities; (3) 25 (32 percent) of the programs do not have literacy as their major function; (4) in FY 1985, only $126.5 million or 36 percent of the $347.6 million was spent on literacy activities for adults; (5) the 10 programs that have literacy as their major function accounted for $99.9 million or 79 percent of the $126.5 million; and  (6) the Adult Education State Administered Program accounted for $81 million or 81 percent of the $99.4 million and 64 percent of the $126.5 million. (The report presents a short analysis of the 79 programs.) (KC)",

As increases in credit usage continue to outpace increases in real income and as savings rates decline, consumers are increasingly likely to suffer financial problems and are increasingly in need of money management skills. Data from a 1977 study of the characteristics of individuals who file for bankruptcy and from a 1984 study of nonbusiness bankruptcy in Texas offer valuable insight into the types of individuals likely to experience serious financial problems and the areas that need to be addressed in high school courses dealing with money management and credit usage skills. Such courses should stress the following: the fact that it is the  average-income, white male between the ages of 30 and 40 who is most likely to file for bankruptcy; the importance of developing a personal budget and keeping personal financial records; the need to view families as minibusinesses; the importance of savings accounts and health insurance; the necessity of evaluating the cost of items in relation to their value; the effects of inflation on money management; and the necessity of adjusting consumption to offset job- and inflation-related changes in income. Students should be exposed to information about debt-load capacity, alternative sources of credit, and the importance of communicating with creditors when debts cannot be paid on time. (MN)",

        "description":"The role and function of the school counselor in the school instructional process has been infrequently examined in the recent \"school reform\" movement. Many of a counselor's duties may center around recordkeeping and evaluation activities. Changes in the instructional and curriculum functions of the school guidance counselor are needed. Planners of the school instructional program must involve the counselor in assessment, diagnosis, and recommendation tasks that assist teachers in working with parents on learning activity plans to ensure students' engagement in the learning process in both school and non-school settings. An effective school reform program must establish policies that encourage use of the guidance counselor as an instructional resource for teachers, parents, and  students. This can be done in at least three ways: (1) counselors must become more involved in intervention-based guidance and counseling activities from the earliest school stages; (2) school districts must take steps to establish a major and broad role for the guidance counselors which makes them monitors of student progress and coordinators of a comprehensive and systematic guidance plan for students; and (3) districts must invest money in training and preparing guidance counselors and other resource people to take a more central role in the school instuctional program.

        "description":"To examine alternatives to nursing home care, states have been testing home and community-based services under the Medicaid program. Information on the operations of the state projects will be vital to designing cost-effective alternative services in the future. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed state reports to see if accurate, complete, and useful information was being collected. The results revealed that data from most states were inaccurate and not useful. Revisions by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) of its reporting requirements and instructions were implemented in 1986 and should improve the accuracy and usefulness of states' reports. The findings also showed that the HCFA does not know how effectively states' home and community-based services  substitute for nursing home care and cannot evaluate whether these programs increase or decrease Medicaid costs. Many people who have participated in community care demonstration projects would not have entered a nursing home had the community-based care been unavailable. To assume that all alternative care recipients use these services to prevent or postpone admission to nursing homes is unrealistic and could lead to false conclusions about program cost-effectiveness. GAO recommends that the administrator of HCFA develop measures of home and community-based services programs' ability to prevent or postpone nursing home care and use these measures to evaluate waiver program cost-effectiveness.

        "description":"Planned Parenthood conducted a national public opinion poll, asking 1,000 12- through 17-year-olds about their knowledge and beliefs on the problem of teenage pregnancy. The results showed that over 50% of the adolescents had sexual intercourse before their 18th birthday. Those teenagers most likely to be sexually active fell into certain at-risk groups with the common denominator being limited life opportunities for further education and career development. Reasons respondents gave for being sexually active included social pressure, followed by curiosity and sexual gratification. However, the most common reason given was that the respondent was \"swept away.\" The majority reported not using contraceptives because they did not know enough about them or even where to get them.  Forty percent of the adolescents had no sexuality education in school; only 35 percent had comprehensive sexuality education. Parents have been cited as the primary source of information, yet many respondents reported never having discussed sexuality with their parents. Respondents reported believing that television gave realistic views of sexually trasmitted diseases, pregnancy, the consequences of sex, and family planning. This opinion appeared to change, however, as sexuality education became more comprehensive. Adolescents needing the most education included those doing poorly in school, those in vocational tracks in schools, boys, those from low and middle income families, younger teenagers, and teenagers living in the south.

Purposes of a support group are discussed; differences between support and therapy groups are explained; and structural aspects of support groups are described, including the format of the group, group membership, open or closed membership groups, time-limiting, and group size. The role of leading a support group is discussed. Three developmental stages of groups are identified: orientation, evaluation, and action. Outreach, internal communications, sponsorship, leadership training, and evaluation are discussed as they relate to  group maintenance. Seven topics are addressed in the final section on pitfalls and special issues: (1) member burnout; (2) leader burnout; (3) resources; (4) new members; (5) social functions; (6) controlling members; and (7) social action. The guide concludes by stating that support groups can assist their members to achieve personal and group goals related to increased feelings of competence and effectiveness in the caregiving role.

        "description":"This paper examines, in terms of family role expectations, problems and difficulties experienced by families with aging members. These difficulties are presented as a manifestation of dysfunctional societal attitudes and beliefs that make it inevitable that an aging family will experience conflict with regard to family roles. Dysfunctional beliefs identified include beliefs that: (1) older adults are necessarily dependent on other family members for their physical and emotional well-being; (2) older adults need tangible assistance more than social and emotional support; and (3) support for older adults is inherently discrepant with the well-being of other family members. Inappropriate or inherently conflictual role expectations which can undermine the supportive quality of late  life family relationships and foster feelings of guilt and resentment for adult children as well as for their elderly parents are described. Some of the incorrect assumptions on which these dysfunctional beliefs are based are identified. A treatment model designed to assist family members in relieving the strain associated with such beliefs is introduced. The treatment model presented involves components of clarification of role expectations, promotion of personal autonomy, and enhancement of relationship quality. A case example is included which illustrates use of the model. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Opinion polls in the United States have shown gender differences in attitudes toward military issues, with women reporting less support for aggressive military options than do men. The cross cultural stability of gender differences in attitudes toward military issues was examined using data from 2,145 West Germans who reported opinions about the arms race, the German peace movement, and decisions made by President Reagan. The German data replicated the gender differences found in the United States, with German women expressing more peaceful opinions than did German men. A field experiment was conducted using 63 men and 38 women to examine whether this gender difference could be due to a lower interest by women in political issues and a tendency by men to comment on political  issues despite an inadequate knowledge base. The results revealed that women with a high degree of knowledge about military issues were more likely to report attitudes in favor of disarmament than were men with a comparable level of knowledge. Women with low or moderate levels of knowledge, however, did not differ from men in their views. These data provide little support for the gender gap hypothesis. What appeared to be a pronounced difference in political attitudes now seems due to a high degree of &quot;no opinion&quot; responses from women. Only a minority of well-informed women were found to consistently show more peaceful attitudes than their male counterparts. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"While much of the research on sex roles has treated gender self-perceptions and stereotypes in terms of chronic traits, sex role stereotypes may apply to specific situations and activities as they do to more global traits. Perceptions of masculinity and femininity, therefore, may vary across situations. This study used a situational approach to examine issues of sex role identity and to look more closely at the similarity and accuracy of people's perceptions of the opposite sex. Male (N=52) and female (N=64) college students rated how masculine or feminine they felt in each of 30 situations that varied in their apparent relevance to sex roles. One-half of the subjects also completed the ratings as they thought a typical member of the opposite sex would feel in those same  situations. In a second study, 30 males and 30 females provided self-descriptions using the same situations and rating scale mentioned above and also completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory. The results suggest that the salience of own-gender identity varies considerably across situations and is particularly heightened when interacting with the opposite sex in what might be regarded as a romantic way. These findings complement the trait approach to sex roles in showing that gender identity is not necessarily a constant, but can be accentuated, neutralized, or reversed depending on one's activities. The findings also demonstrate that some situations and activities, like some traits, remain sex stereotyped. (NB)",

Results from younger adults, aged 20-29 (N=118) and older adults, aged 50 and over (N=107) were used to examine age and sex differences in adult humor. The results revealed that, as recipients, younger people enjoyed humor in the media and with acquaintances for the other person's \"outlook on life\" while the reason given for personal use of humor was \"tension release.\" Women more than men  reported parents as having no sense of humor, with older women citing no humor more often than younger women.

This study investigated the psychometric characteristics of the Quality of Teacher Work Life Survey (QTWL) and examined which factors can be addressed by the school counselor in working to improve teacher well-being. The QTWL Survey was completed by 251 teachers who rated their present degree of satisfaction and the degree of stress experienced in each of 36 job-related areas, such as salaries, time for preparation, relationships with parents, and student interest. The results suggest that job satisfaction and job stress for teachers are multidimensional rather than unidimensional in nature. Job satisfaction and job stress, as measured by the  QTWL, appeared to be strongly related. Overall job satisfaction and job stress for the teachers surveyed did not appear to be significantly related to most demographic variables. A slight but significant relationship may exist between satisfaction and educational level and between age and stress. Although further validation is needed, the QTWL holds promise as a measure of job satisfaction and job stress in teachers and as a diagnostic tool to help school counselors to focus staff development efforts to meet the specific needs of their teachers.

        "description":"No particular psychotherapy technique or professional training has been found to be superior to others. Rather it is where theory and technique meet and come alive, in the personality of the therapist, that a definitive factor in effective psychotherapy appears. One of the personality variables in the therapist, not explored in the psychotherapy research, is that of self-awareness. Self-awareness in the therapist is a construct considered important in many theoretical orientations. Since psychotherapists spend most of their time attempting to promote self-awareness in their patients, it is surprising that so little formal promotion of self-awareness in therapists takes place. No formal model has been advanced to develop this portion of clinical training. The metacognitive or  dialectical model (discussed in detail in the document) is a beginning to this development. By adopting a dialectical attitude, the various techniques to facilitate self-awareness of therapists and patients can be used. This attitude can be used by therapists to guide one another in their own discoveries. The potential of the dialectic for exploring more fully the inner experiences in therapy will greatly enhance psychotherapists' abilities as enablers of patients, and will make them more effective as psychotherapists.

        "description":"Recent studies have evaluated career strategies and their relationship to career success. Previous research has evaluated career success as perceived by persons evaluating others' careers, generally with such criteria as job title, salary, and promotions. This study examined career success through a combination of objective and subjective measures. Managers (N=194) from 14 businesses, each with 1,000 or more employees, participated by completing a questionnaire assessing their views on career development. The questionnaire contained four segments: social background variables; organizational and situational variables; career strategies and tactics; and success. It was found that the measures formed three factors: (1) level and income, (2) satisfaction, and (3) hierarchical career  development. Success on two of the factors, hierarchical career development and level and income appeared best predicted by social background characteristics such as age, years in career, and education. In contrast, organizational and situational variables and strategy factors added little to the prediction of any success factor. Results imply that the efficient allocation of human resources demands that decision makers become increasingly aware of the prevailing perceptions of career success in their employees. The ultimate goal of management should be the best &quot;fit&quot; possible between individual and company needs, to maximize benefits for all involved. (Author/ABL)",

Research indicates that there is a need for a theory of technological innovation and strategic human resource management considering several factors, such as an employee's beliefs about the effect of technological innovations on the quality of work life and work content. Furthermore, application skills held by the individual should allow, the employee to use technology innovatively. Employees' beliefs about technological innovation need to be positive to assure a high quality of work life as well as the effective use of new technology. Relationships are proposed among several variables: quality of work life, acceptance of technology, job and task characteristics, anticipated technology-induced change, job content  of skills, organized labor, and the public's acceptance of technological innovation. Relationships are also posed for these variables: range and depth of application skills, mechanical and application skills, variety and complexity of application, innovative application, discrete tasks, and developing job-related applications. Research testing of these relationships is suggested. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"As an approach to mental health skills training, Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR) emphasizes a learning by discovery method. There are seven basic units in the IPR training package: (1) presentation, on the skills of facilitating communication; (2) affect simulation; (3) counselor recall; (4) inquirer training; (5) client recall; (6) mutual recall; and (7) transfer of learning. The IPR model could be adapted for use in the training of trauma counselors. In addition to the review of types of helping behaviors in IPR's first unit, trauma counselors need to receive a conceptual understanding of the process of trauma. The theoretical literature related to trauma and to posttraumatic responses could be combined with the IPR method of influencing interpersonal responding. The second  unit, affect simulation, can be altered to present simulation vignettes that would elicit feelings likely to be directly tied to incest, rape, accident trauma, or war-related stress. Parts of the IPR training package that involve actual recall sessions could also be adapted for use in training trauma counselors. Evaluation of the IPR method is essential and should involve studies comparing client outcomes of IRP-trained trauma counselors against a randomly assigned group of trauma counselors prepared by other methods. Outcome measures could include client self-monitoring and psychophysiological, self-report, and behavioral measurements. (NB)",

        "description":"The Lancaster Visiting Cottage Program, located at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Lancaster, was implemented to allow children to visit overnight with their incarcerated mothers. It was hoped that the program would reunite mothers with their children, help them to maintain or re-establish close ties, and prepare mothers for their eventual release. A process evaluation was conducted of the program's first year in operation. The evaluation found that, during the first year, there were 111 extended visits between 30 inmate mothers and 51 of their children. Most of the visits occurred on weekends and usually lasted two nights. The majority of visits involved a mother and a single child. The mothers participating in the program averaged an extended program visit every  42 days. Although the program was implemented smoothly as planned, the level of participation expected by program planners was higher than the actual level of participation achieved in the first year. This evaluation report highlights some of the staff and inmate theories regarding the low participation rate and presents a statistical analysis of frequent participants, infrequent participants, and nonparticipants. The evaluation also presents information on inmate mothers who participated in the program, citing significant differences in the backgrounds and needs of long-term versus short-term inmates. This information should be useful in future program and policy planning. (Author/NB)",

The AMPS program introduced students to the concept of social pressure (especially peer pressure) to misuse alcohol and to strategies to effectively counter such pressure. The program was evaluated in 213 classrooms in six school districts with 4,911 students completing the first posttest, and 4,185 completing the second. Schools were randomly assigned to the condition pretest or no pretest; and to control, program, or program plus booster groups. Information was collected on students' knowledge about alcohol, health locus of control, self-esteem, and susceptibility to peer pressure. At the second posttest, 14 months after the  program's implementation, a statistically significant effect was found on students' alcohol attitudes and knowledge. There were no significant differences between conditions on alcohol use and misuse, due to low prevalence in both groups. As students become seventh and eighth graders, significant effects are expected to appear in the third posttest when alcohol use and misuse are expected to rise. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Curriculum placement or tracking is a form of ability grouping most common in secondary schools. This study focused on the role of school characteristics and policies in shaping the tracking system, from the perspective that educational attainment is a consequence of the interaction between individual abilities and efforts and the learning opportunities provided by the school. Data were analyzed from the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; study, which sampled students from 1,100 schools. Track placement was measured by students' description of their high school programs as academic, general, or vocational and their comments as to whether they chose this program or were assigned to it. Socioeconomic status (SES) of the family and school, ability of the individual students, and academic  inclusiveness data were generated. Ability was the most important predictor of track placement. Social class background was strongly related to track placement. Track placement was not based solely on characteristics of individual students. School-level variables modified the relationship of ability and student-SES to track placement. Two-thirds of the sample chose their track and were more often located in the academic or vocational track while those assigned were more likely to be in the general track. Analyses revealed systematic differences among types of schools, suggesting that track placement is more complex than previously indicated and that school-level variables should be included in research on track placement.

The planned evaluation of the TEACH project is discussed as a two-phase process: a service evaluation will assess service cost-effectiveness, impacts on the care receiver and caregiver, and impacts on health service utilization by the targeted Medicaid population over age 65; an interagency coordination evaluation will describe the coordination efforts in terms of domain consensus, goal congruence, and communication.

In many institutions the peer culture is estranged from the academic life of the campus. If student affairs professionals want to have a significant impact on the values of college students they must be able to influence the peer culture. In order to influence the peer culture it is necessary to understand the culture by conducting research on the students and by systematically using data from such research. Student culture must be clearly established as a domain for student development intervention by making formal connections among the curriculum,  teaching, and student life. Finally, student affairs professionals must identify and confront those value issues in the peer culture which conflict with educational objectives and have the greatest impact on students' moral development. Important areas to consider include: (1) alcohol and drug education; (2) sexuality; (3) academic integrity; (4) racism and sexism; and (5) volunteerism. Student affairs staff need to be more active in promoting opportunities for students to serve others, combat harmful elements in their environment, and work for noble ideas and causes. (NB)",

Health care providers must view their health care delivery organizations as businesses and must use the tools of business, including marketing. Most research on health care marketing has focused on the practices of large, urban facilities. Little work has been accomplished on the marketing attitudes, perceptions, or abilities of rural health care practitioners. To examine these issues, questionnaires were mailed to health care practitioners in North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. Responses from 1,049 physicians, health organization board members, directors of nursing, health administrators, public health officials, and other health care providers revealed that: (1) marketing was considered an  important activity in the profession and respondents desired more marketing education services; (2) health care personnel held a narrow view that marketing was salesmanship; (3) marketing resulted in a more positive response to patients and increased patient satisfaction; (4) rural patients were shortchanged when urban organizations took over local health facilities; and (5) females held a more positive image of marketing than did males. These findings suggest the need to make marketing and marketing education available to health care personnel. (The questionnaire and respondent comments are appended.) (Author/NB)",

The problem of child abuse is presented in the first section of the report. The next section identifies barriers which may be significant factors in the implementation of a comprehensive child abuse prevention program. Lack of coordination by service providers, lack of training in the area of child abuse and neglect among professionals who work with children, family life education in the schools, teacher preparation for teaching family life education, availability of affordable day care, inadequate public/private collaboration, public awareness of child abuse, and  attitudes toward discipline are considered. The major part of the report concentrates on five priority areas for North Carolina in the prevention of child abuse identified by the State Board of Education. Separate sections are included on each of the five priorities: (1) prevention programs; (2) training and education; (3) interagency cooperation and public-private collaboration; (4) evaluation and research; and (5) public awareness. Recommendations for legislative and administrative action are included and a list of references and resources is provided. (NB)",

This scientist-practitioner or Boulder Model, named for the 1950 conference on clinical psychology held in Boulder, Colorado, has been the subject of much scholarly debate. A study was undertaken to examine the career goals and scholarly productivity of 176 clinical psychology graduate students from 16 doctoral programs approved by the American Psychological Association. Students were surveyed via telephone (N=140) or via mail (N=36). The survey questionnaire focused on clinical interest, research interest, teaching interest, scholarly productivity, and miscellaneous student and advisor characteristics. The results revealed that programs differed widely  with respect to level of student scholarly productivity (e.g. publications), interest in research, and interest in clinical work. Across programs, substantial support was obtained for the hypothesis that individual students generally choose to specialize in either clinical work or research only and rarely choose to work extensively in both areas. Students, however, did not select research and clinical orientations with equal frequency; a predominantly clinical orientation emerged. A small number of programs seemed to produce students with equal interest in research and clinical practice. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the Boulder Model. (NB)",

The San Mateo County, California Server Information Program (SIP) is a community-based prevention strategy designed to decrease alcohol problems, especially the problem of drinking and driving. The program began with a free awareness training offered to all on-sale alcohol beverage licensees in the county in 1984. Recruitment procedures were implemented the following year and operators who agreed to be trained were offered a 6-hour training module which focused on legal and administrative concerns, alcohol problem statistics, alcohol physiology, motivation  to drink, assertiveness training, signs of intoxication, pacing food and drink, prevention policy and management backup, and cutting off service. The SIP also provides funds to local police jurisdictions to mount decoy operations. Program evaluation is currently underway . Collaborative efforts such as the SIP provide an important tool to reduce the societal level of alcohol problems. (NB)",

San Mateo County, however, served as a demonstration county for the effort and has continued to explore third-party reimbursements for nonhospital alcoholism and drug addiction treatment programs through the San Mateo County Third-Party Project. The San Mateo County Alcohol and Drug Program became actively involved in the solicitation of employee assistance program referrals and hoped to market services through the San Mateo Consortium which would include social model alcohol and drug detoxification, outpatient alcohol and drug treatment, and residential  alcohol and drug treatment. Program development and implemetation involved a three-phase process of information gathering and identification of obstacles to implementation, pre-marketing preparations, and actual implementation. Initial efforts were focused on businesses and unions with a minimum of 100 employees living or working in the county and that possessed appropriate insurance coverage. The Third-Party Project is currently receiving the first wave of client referrals. Several contracts between providers and union trust funds are in negotiation.

This study explored the interactive effects of these factors under the hypothesis that dispositional characteristics should be more strongly related to perceptions of leadership when performance information is unavailable than when it is available (i.e., a hypothesized diminution of individual difference effects with salient contextual information). College students (N=80) were randomly assigned to one of eight cells in a 2x2x2 design manipulating the level of exhibited leader behavior, the availability of post-observational performance information, and the type of ratings  desired. Subjects viewed one of two 15-minute videotapes demonstrating two varieties of leader behavior, and provided information on their own gender, age, locus of control, task/person orientation, leniency response bias, and confidence in rating the leader's behavior. In addition, bogus performance information was given to half the subjects within each behavior condition. Analyses of reported perceptions of observed leader behavior offered partial support for the diminution effect, as well as some evidence of individuals discounting contextual information. (NB)",

While studies often compare the improvements made over a treatment and a comparable waiting list, studies seldom consider the relative efficacies of immediate and delayed treatment. In this study, 40 mildly depressed clients received individual cognitive-behavioral therapy either immediately or following a 6-week waiting period. Cognitive-behavioral therapy of depression was provided in a 6-week format by graduate student therapists. Subjects were assessed at the beginning of either the 6-week treatment or waiting period and again following treatment using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the D30 Depression Scale, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and  the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (both the A-State and A-Trait forms). A multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted and revealed a significant time by treatment condition interaction. Subjects who received immediate therapy improved significantly more than did subjects who received delayed treatment as measured by scores on the BDI, BSI, and A-State, and nearly significantly more on the A-Trait. Implications for the effectiveness of brief therapy following a waiting list period are discussed. (Author/NB)",

This study involved the development of a measure of client role preferences which attempted to survey a wider range of therapist traits and behaviors than has been typical in previous work and which was specifically designed for use in outpatient treatment settings. The Role Preference Inventory, a 74-item checklist of client role preferences in the areas of therapist characteristics, therapist activities, and client activities, was administered to clients seeking treatment at a university psychology clinic, a community mental health center in a small  community, and a community mental health center in a larger urban area. Data were collected for one year at the mental health centers and for over 2 years at the psychology clinic. Results from 170 subjects suggest that it is possible to identify and measure distinct dimensions of client role preferences. Concern, support, expertise, problem resolution, and separateness or distance between the client and therapist all appeared to be general dimensions central to the clients' perceptions of therapists. A five cluster solution from the K-Means analysis data was selected as offering the best combination of statistical discrimination among groups and potential clinical meaningfulness of the groups.

        "description":"A review of the research on the effects of parental influence and parental involvement on children's reading achievement indicates that when parents take an active and positive part in their child's education the results often turn out well for the student. Parental influence is defined as any opinion, attitude, or action (other than direct tutoring) that somehow shapes or molds the child's reading attitudes. Involvement is defined as any direct tutorial help the child receives with his or her reading. Studies show that parental role modeling will improve a child's reading, because the child sees reinforcement of the value of education outside of school. Parents who read books and magazines as leisure activities are more likely to have children with a high degree of interest in  literature and reading. Other studies indicate that a child must want to read before he or she can acquire any substantial reading skills. Parents' attitudes other than toward reading can also influence reading achievement. Conflict or overprotection can interfere with reading skills, sometimes requiring parent counseling. Direct parental involvement in the form of tutoring can significantly increase a child's reading skills, although the parents must also know how to tutor in order to get the best possible results. Successful readers tutored in the home receive fewer critical and punishing statements from their parents than do problem readers. Overall, the research shows that the more help a child receives from his or her parents, and the more prepared they are to help their child, the  better the child's reading achievement. (HTH)",

        "description":"In school districts throughout the United States, at-risk students are receiving remedial instruction in learning centers outside the classroom. Because this separation increases the likelihood that students will receive a fragmented education, learning center staff should provide remedial students with \"curricular congruence,\" or content and strategies needed for success in subject matter classrooms. This approach has been implemented at a Long Island (New York) high school, where students in the learning center read the same books as do those in the content area classroom, and staff help the students develop strategies that lead to independence in the English classroom. This is achieved through cooperation between learning center staff and content area teachers, and the process  benefits both the students and the teachers in instructional matters as well as morale. The cooperation also reduces illiteracy and number of dropouts by making the students feel more successful in school. Implementing curricular congruence is not expensive, although the Long Island system used a seven-period day which required hiring additional instructors. A short inservice workshop that stresses the main goals of curricular congruence suffices to introduce teachers to the plan, and the workshop should focus on sameness of instructional materials, reading skills, and strategies stressed; direct instruction, use of remedial classes as supplements, rather than substitutes for regular instruction; and good communication among teachers and administration. This successful formula contrasts  with unsuccessful programs in which teachers feel remedial students are the sole responsibility of learning center instructors.

        "description":"A study compared reading instruction in two South Carolina public elementary schools, Sumner and Danville, that receive federal funding for remedial reading instruction under Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. The two schools vary in many ways--Danville is a &quot;traditional&quot; school in a predominantly black urban environment, while Sumner enrolls students from a relatively well-to-do suburb and a rural poor trailer park community. Data for analysis were culled from diverse sources: questionnaires; interviews with school district Chapter 1 coordinators, principals, teachers, instructional aides, and students; and field notes on the instructional days of Chapter 1 students. Data revealed that Danville used the &quot;pullout&quot; model for remedial instruction, sending  students to a reading lab to receive instruction from a teacher and an aide, while Sumner used &quot;floating&quot; aides who worked within the classrooms. Results also indicated that Sumner students received 110 minutes of reading instruction daily, of which 21 minutes was Chapter 1 service. Danville students received 145 minutes of daily reading instruction, and the average Chapter 1 class was 50 minutes long. At Sumner, instruction was mostly in the lecture/recitation format, but at Danville the format was more varied. Findings showed that both schools emphasized the basal reader series, with more time spent on lower order comprehension than on &quot;higher order&quot; thinking.

Two experiments investigated children's awareness of phonemes and of two intrasyllabic units, onset (the initial consonant or consonant cluster) and rime (the vowel and any following consonants) in spoken words. Fifty-six kindergarten students participated in the first experiment, and results indicated that while they were aware of both syllables and intrasyllabic units in a word comparison task, they were not aware of phonemes in the same  task. Results of the second experiment, in which 20 first grade students compared words differing only in onset complexity, yielded similar results, which again indicates that children find it easier to divide syllables into onsets and rimes than into phonemes. The findings suggest that word segmentation instruction should be sequenced with syllable segmentation instruction and precede instruction in onset and rime segmentation, leaving phoneme segmentation instruction last. Findings also suggest that the ideal approach to reading instruction is a compromise between the whole word approach, which ignores children's ability to segment words, and the phonics approach, which over-emphasizes phonemic segmentation.

        "description":"This study investigated the development of students' abilities to integrate information in stories as an aspect of reading comprehension. Students aged 8, 11, 14, and 18 judged the importance of key statements, which varied in their causal relations within an episode, between episodes, and in a higher-order structure, yielding three levels of possible integration. Results showed that within an episode, all age groups judged to the same degree statements that causally integrated many other statements as more important than statements that integrated few other statements. However, only students 11 years old and older recognized the importance of statements that related pairs of episodes. Further, not until students were 14 could they identify statements that allowed higher-order  structuring of episodes as important. The findings attest to the central role that causal inferences play in the integration of information in stories. While students of all age groups were sensitive to the causal role of statements within episodes, the ability to infer causal relations at higher levels of integration appears to be strongly related to age and grade level.

Subjects, 91 students from five school districts, were behind at least one grade in reading word recognition skills but were of average intellectual ability. They were trained on the Autoskill Program according to procedures specifically developed for three reading disability subtypes: oral reading, intermodal-associative, and sequential. Two control groups consisted of reading disabled students who did not receive any specific intervention except that which they were already obtaining in their schools, and students receiving alternate computer programs  for remedial assistance. Results indicated that the Autoskill-trained students made significant gains in reading word recognition, phonetic skills, and paragraph reading. Findings also showed teacher and student evaluations of the program to be quite positive. These results replicated those of a previous field study, and additionally, represented more extensive benefits of the training procedures in that the transfer of training effects included paragraph reading and comprehension.

The reading level of the series varied from sixth to eighth-grade level. Data were gathered using an evaluation questionnaire sent to parents as they completed the booklet series. Of the more than 51,000 parents estimated to have received the series during the study year, 2,263 returned their questionnaires. Results indicated that while respondent characteristics varied from state to state, most were 25 years old or older, white, married with some post high school education. Fifty percent lived in urban  areas, and 60% were first time parents. Results also indicated that all booklet series were well read, with 84% of the respondents reporting having read all articles in all issues, and 74% reporting that someone other than themselves--usually the spouse and/or the baby's grandparents--also read the booklets. Eighty-five percent rated the writing style of the booklets as &quot;just right,&quot; and most reported that all the major subjects included were &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;very&quot; helpful. Results suggest that the booklets achieved their intended purpose, and that &quot;age-paced&quot; home learning programs serve a useful purpose. (HTH)",

        "description":"Sixty-six college students read two chapters from a contemporary novel while their eye movements were monitored. The eye movement data were analyzed to identify factors that influence the location of a reader's initial eye fixation on a word. When the data were partitioned according to the location of the prior fixation (i.e., launch site), the distribution of fixation locations on the word (i.e., landing site distribution) was highly constrained, normal in shape and not influenced by word length. The locations of initial fixations on words can be accounted for on the basis of five principles of oculomotor control: (1) a word-object has a specific functional target location; (2) a saccadic range error occurs that produces a systematic deviation of landing sites from the  functional target location; (3) the saccadic range error is reduced somewhat for saccades that follow longer eye fixations; (4) there exists oculomotor variability that is a second, non-systematic source of error in landing sites; and (5) the oculomotor variability increases with distance of the launch site from the target.

Rosse. Rosse's theory hypothesized four layers of newspaper competition--large metropolitan dailies, satellite daily papers, suburban dailies, and weekly newspapers and shoppers' papers. The current study hypothesized that as the intensity of umbrella competition increases, the following occurs: (1) amount of space devoted to news and editorial matter increases; (2) amount of space devoted to local news, editorial space and to staff copy increases; and (3) staff size and number of wire services carried increases. It was also hypothesized that suburban daily newspapers will carry more local  news and editorial material than satellite city daily papers, which in turn will carry more than daily metropolitan papers. A randomly stratified sample of 114 newspapers was analyzed and coded. Results indicated that the first two hypotheses were partially supported, but the third hypothesis was not. Findings also showed that suburban daily newspapers had a significantly larger percentage of news section available for news, a smaller percentage of news space given to foreign news, a larger percentage of space given to county news, and smaller circulation than did metropolitan dailies. Satellite dailies had a larger percentage of space for county news than did metropolitan dailies, as well as less space for editorials addressing city issues.

Nine hundred suburban communities were sampled--300 randomly selected from each of the three different central market structures (monopoly markets, competitive markets, or joint operating agreement). Results indicated that the newspaper market structure of the central cities did not bar nor extensively influence either the existence of suburban newspapers or their circulation.  Competitive central markets were positively related to suburban weekly paid circulation. In every instance population of the suburb, as an indicator of demand, was important to both the existence and circulation of suburban newspapers.

        "description":"Satellite news gathering (SNG) has been widely adopted in broadcast journalism in recent years, and appears likely to grow in importance as local television news operations increase their reliance on it. However, because the technology for SNG is so new, information transmitted through SNG systems is not adequately protected under current laws. Congress attempted to protect the interest of SNG originators in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, which designated SNG transmissions as &quot;private,&quot; but the Act provides only some protection in some situations. Moreover, it cannot be determined with precision which situations will trigger SNG protection under the Act and which will not. The best outlines for protection of SNG transmission appear to be in protection of  intellectual property, though the law provides little guidance on the issue of detection and damages when an SNG feed is stolen. The 1986 Act is valuable in that it recognizes the interests of originators of SNG feeds, but is inadequate because it says nothing about the nature of satellite transmissions. Clearly, further congressional measures are warranted for the protection of such new technology. (JC)",

        "description":"To examine the most important changes in marketing and advertising of the decade from 1976 to 1986, more than 100 people were interviewed, and their responses were fashioned into an oral history modeled on the technique used in Studs Terkel's popular books. Among those interviewed were advertising and marketing professionals, as well as casual observers. Although the decade in question was perceived as a dynamic period for advertisers, marketers, and consumers, one pioneer in advertising education felt that there had been no significant creative changes in his 40 years of teaching, but rather that the effect of the electronic revolution on marketing and advertising in general has been profound. One pattern in the interviews identified the importance of the progress induced as a  by-product of the new technologies, i.e., segmentation, target marketing and direct marketing made possible by computer sophistication. One person interviewed considered the most distinctive characteristic of the decade not change itself but the ability of both businesses and people to adapt to change. Many interviews focused on the ways advertising and marketing adapted to shifts in consumer attitudes and demographics--increased use of humor in advertising, ways to break through to the jaded viewer/reader, and the maturing of the baby boomers as well as the U.S. population in general. Displaying a consensus of tone, most interviews stressed optimism and accommodation by advertisers, marketers, and consumers. (NKA)",

        "description":"Forty-eight Michigan newspapers were surveyed by telephone to determine their criteria in selecting online database services, type of personnel using them, training procedures, budgets, and perceptions of the impact of these services on the speed of writing stories and quality of reporting. Data collection involved two phases: (1) researchers surveyed Michigan daily newspapers about their use of electronic databases and microcomputers; and (2) examining U.S. and Canadian dailies that are online contributors to VU/TEXT, DATATIMES or NEXIS. Results show that 96% do not subscribe to any online services, with a majority indicating that the services were too expensive, 50% saying they had no need for them, and 15% reporting lack of the expertise to use the services. More than half  viewed online search skills as not very important. The two papers that did subscribe were the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and the &quot;Detroit News.&quot; The &quot;Free Press&quot; also maintains its own computerized &quot;morgue,&quot; or archive, which is integrated with ongoing stories and is provided to the VU/TEXT database. Only three other Michigan newspapers operate micro-computer based &quot;morgues.&quot; The survey also revealed that while 25% of Michigan newspapers have no personal computers of any kind, the rest have most or all of the equipment needed to access online databases should they choose to. Michigan newspapers' apparent lack of interest in online databases contrasts starkly with the growing national interest, reflected in the range of national newspapers contributing to online databases. (Appended tables  compare penetration of IBM PC's, MacIntoshes and laptop computers, correlate computer use with newspaper characteristics, and analyze database contributors by city size and circulation.)

        "description":"A study examined the types of writing courses currently offered by English departments at major universities, how they have changed over the last 10 years, and whether enrollments have increased or decreased during that period. The English departments at 198 institutions with graduate programs were surveyed; 105 usable responses were received (a 53% response rate). Results indicated that courses in creative writing, composition theory and rhetoric, and writing instruction were the most pervasive courses at the graduate level, with business and technical writing not likely to be available at that level. The required \"service\" writing courses along with the creative writing and advanced composition courses are the most pervasive courses at the undergraduate level. Freshman  composition is almost universal. Even without freshman composition, writing courses are generally more available at the undergraduate level than at the graduate level, with the size of the institution determining the number of offerings. On average, 1.7 of the 2.3 graduate courses are new since 1975, and 3.9 of the 11 undergraduate courses are new. On average also, enrollments in writing courses have increased dramatically in the last 10 years while enrollments in literature courses have remained stable. Results suggest that within the past 10 years, writing instruction has expanded in both variety and size in colleges and universities. (References are attached.) (HTH)",

        "author":["Osburg, Barbara"],
        "description":"Secondary school teachers of English often avoid teaching T.S. Eliot's poetry because they consider his work too difficult for young readers and too full of esoteric allusions. However, at the heart of his work is a variety of rich, concrete images which can be used to reveal his meaning and which can be offered to students in the form of drawings or images on an overhead projector. Teachers can readily adapt Eliot's &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; to this method by drawing &quot;death's dream kingdom,&quot; consisting of three scarecrows slumped together, followed by a rat walking over shards of glass, cacti, and a fading star. Teachers, following the poem, can then draw &quot;death's other kingdom,&quot; represented by a rose, sunlight on a broken column, a tree, and people singing. Teachers can further  distinguish the two halves of the picture by explaining the history of Guy Fawkes, the failed English revolutionary and Joseph Conrad's character Kurtz from &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; who together form the keynote of the poem, and placing their names in the appropriate portions of the picture. The vivid images offered in a visual, rather than written, context can help students comprehend Eliot's nightmare vision of the world, and his preference for evil, violent figures who see the world as it is rather than the nondescript, silent majority who populate the twentieth century wasteland. Such a concrete, accessible method also works with Eliot's other poems for example &quot;Prufrock,&quot; the &quot;Quartets,&quot; and &quot;The Wasteland.&quot; (A copy of &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; and sample drawings are included.)

        "author":["Swales, John"],
        "description":"Since a discourse community may have its membership assigned both on the basis of speech or of writing, it follows that the concept of discourse community needs to be both medium-neutral and unconstrained by space and time. The defining characteristics of a discourse community might be (1) communality of interest, (2) mechanisms for intercommunication between members, (3) survival by providing information and feedback, (4) development of genre-specific discoursal expectations, (5) possession of an embedded dynamic towards an increasingly shared and specialized terminology, and (6) a critical mass of members with a suitable degree of relevant discoursal and content expertise. Characterizing discourse communities in this way leads to several consequences--the most salient being  that the fact that groups have things in common in no way implies that such groups form discourse communities. In addition, sketching the boundaries of discourse communities implies that individuals may belong to several communities and will vary in the number of communities they belong to and thus in the number of genres they command. Other points are that the criteria presented do not impose preconditions as to a prior expectation of a high level of personal involvement among members; a community may or may not be connected to what members perceive as the central activities and concerns of their lives; and discourse communities will vary in the extent to which they are norm developed or set in their ways.

        "description":"A tutor charged with the task of helping a third-grade child with good reading skills improve his writing skills developed a plan to move the student gradually from dictating stories to writing independently. The student had difficulty initiating and maintaining on-task behavior and disliked writing independently, although he had &quot;written&quot; a number of stories, dictating them to another tutor. The tutor's first step in reversing the problem was to copy down the student's stories as he made them up. In their second session, the tutor read the child's stories to him and asked him to write them down. When spelling was a problem, the student was encouraged to use approximated spelling and continue. In a later session, the tactic of cutting the boy's stories into separate words helped  him focus on details of the print and revise misspelled words. As he re-read his stories, words he found difficult were looked up in the dictionary and revised, and he discovered that looking up core words, such as &quot;cobra&quot; gave him the spelling for peripheral words such as &quot;snake&quot; and &quot;dangerous.&quot; The student came away with a structured way to write and revise his work, making him more confident about his command of writing skills. However, tutors of children who do not have good initial reading skills and vocabulary may have to adapt the program. (Six references and three writing samples are included.) (JC)",

        "description":"A study explored literacy myths of the academic culture as expressed by college writing students, examining shared literacy myths about the acquisition and uses of literacy, how beliefs influence literacy acquisition, and how cultural roles determine literacy experiences. Students were asked to write autobiographical accounts of their literacy acquisition, which were interpreted using methodology grounded in Kenneth Burke's language philosophy. Examination of the 200-plus personal narratives collected revealed that these autobiographies offered key insights into culturally shared assumptions about the nature of literacy. Because they were self-reflexive, these narratives transformed contextual elements of beginning literacy into textual elements. The narratives shared a common  macrotext, which could be divided into (1) acquisition of literacy skills, (2) practice of literacy, (3) awareness of one's literacy, and (4) awareness of the uses of literacy. Theoretically this recursive activity is never-ending, since the last stage leads again to the first--further acquisition of literacy skills. A writer progresses through each of these stages within the context of a particular culture's literacy practices, which are determined by the culture's shared values and established power relations. Boys and girls interpret the literacy experience differently, and recognizing such differences is essential to understanding the literacy practices of any group. More often than not, the male myth represents literacy as a means of achieving autonomy, while in the female myth it is  a means of participation.

Additionally, the guide emphasizes the writing process, increases the prominence of personal response to literature, and aligns terminology and grammar with the reading and writing processes. The first chapter describes the rationale, philosophy, goals, and general objectives of the language arts program grades 1 through 12, and then describes required and elective contents of the junior high program. Chapter 2  discusses the rationale behind the integration of the five language strands and outlines the process of each. Chapter 3 presents the methodology of teaching, including a discussion of the teacher's role, planning strategies, developmental patterns in adolescent students, class activities and assignments, motivational techniques, and grading. Chapter 4 discusses purposes, types and methods of student evaluation, providing methods for effectively evaluating each of the language strands as well as the program itself.

        "description":"Designed to help teachers in writing programs collaborate to reach a consensus on grading standards for freshman essays, the &quot;Buddy System&quot; was instituted on a voluntary basis at a Pennsylvania college with an English department with a traditional literature orientation. To participate, the instructors were required: (1) to choose at least one buddy; (2) to design a writing assignment together; (3) to give this assignment to the classes of all the instructors involved; (4) to determine primary traits together; (5) to choose papers at random; (6) to rank papers by letter grade; (7) to discuss and record distinguishing features as secondary traits; (8) to divide total papers so that each paper would be read by two raters; (9) to discuss papers on which the raters disagreed; and  (10) to fill out a form about the process. Eighty-five percent of the faculty participated, including teaching assistants and adjunct and senior faculty. Participants at all levels of experience reported that they all learned about their grading idiosyncracies, and even senior faculty continued to use their &quot;buddies&quot; as consultants in grading questionable papers. Using the &quot;Buddy System&quot; helped to even out grade distribution in the department and reduced the number of students dropping courses taught by &quot;hard&quot; graders. Other benefits are that the program encourages instructors to view writing as a social act and become aware of the legitimacy of different writing styles, and that it encourages faculty at different levels to work together in a non-threatening environment.

        "author":["Baxter, Barbara"],
        "description":"When students have difficulty writing, it is often because they are apathetic or afraid of failing, rather than because of a serious lack of skill. Basic writing teachers must break through student apathy and fear before the students can begin to progress. One way is to ask basic writers to unscramble sentences or analyze ambiguous sentences to discover that they already have a strong command of grammar and structure. Basic writers also often have poor self esteem which can interfere with their ability to produce work comparable with their capabilities. A student-centered environment in the classroom, and use of concrete materials and problems can help students build a sense of self-worth. Small group work and the use of tapes, films, and records can help maintain student  interest, while occasional &quot;frivolous&quot; freewriting or analyzing can break class monotony. Because basic writers usually have numerous problems with their writing, setting one or two tangible goals for each paper can reduce student anxiety about producing a &quot;perfect&quot; paper, and numerous drafts can let them achieve one goal at a time. This strategy reduces the amount of time teachers must spend grading as well. Such methods may help students come to regard writing as a conquerable skill, and provide them with the impetus for further self-directed learning. (JC)",

The third chapter of the book provides a detailed introduction to the observations of teachers and their students, with some general findings about ways in which they used writing in the teaching of academic subjects. The fourth chapter describes the types of writing activities that worked in aa variety of content-area classrooms. Chapter 5 shifts focus away  from the activities provided and toward the redefinition of teaching and learning that occurred in the classrooms where writing worked best to foster learning. Chapters 6 through 8 examine the kinds of thinking promoted by different types of writing in the classroom. The final chapter brings together concerns about the roles of teacher and learner in the instructional interaction, providing a theoretical framework, practical suggestions for an alternative model of instruction, and a discussion of the constraints that must be addressed if wide-scale use of writing to support learning is to become a reality.

The paper argues that to help make graduates more employable in the face of the rise of service industries, the university abandoned literature study for a more skills-oriented approach to English and writing instruction. Following a review of the literature for and against the skills-oriented classroom, the paper argues for the imparting of new skills such as critical thinking, in addition to the basic skills now being taught in composition classes. The paper then  presents the following suggestions for improving the composition classroom: (1) bring literature back into the composition classroom; (2) use a reader that offers complex ideas in composition classes; (3) emphasize the argument paper; (4) help students feel the &quot;slow pace&quot; of critical thought; and (5) look critically at how economies are structuring society.

This assignment required students to define terms and clarify the ideas they had argued for during a class discussion. They were encouraged to deepen and expand their thinking by reading further and discussing their ideas with friends, leading to an exploratory essay that would not merely argue one-sidedly for ideas but lead toward illumination for the writer. The instructor and the students found the assignment very helpful, and discovered that some students changed their  minds about their original ideas in the course of writing the paper. Students were then asked to write a paper about their own writing, which forced them to examine how their thinking evolved. The course, focusing on expanding on the ideas in essays rather than on close reading, created better, more analytical thinkers who began to see ideas as connected rather than discrete. (JC)",

A peer review board, which consisted of four composition instructors, was established by the center director, in cooperation with a composition teacher consultant, to ensure the quality of user documentation written by engineering faculty. However, program and systems analysts, managers, and other center personnel generally refused to participate in peer review. Time constraints placed on routine writing tasks, writers' attitudes, and other sociopolitical elements of the environment did not allow the proper atmosphere for an autonomous, writer-supported peer group. The writers considered themselves to be good  writers and resented the fact that the director questioned their ability. In addition, the management style of one major division at the center did not support any form of collaborative writing. Further, no systems were in place to evaluate the effectiveness of writing, to promote the importance of writing among staff, and to offer assistance, in the form of policies, guidelines or manuals, to help writers with their tasks.

It was hypothesized: (1) that individual dimensions of self-disclosure and disclosiveness are negatively related to loneliness; and (2) that linear composites of self-disclosure factors and general disclosiveness are negatively related to loneliness. Respondents, 595 students in basic communications courses at an eastern university, completed questionnaires concerning self-disclosure, general disclosiveness, and loneliness. Half the questionnaires asked students to report self-disclosure to the mother or female  guardian, the other half to the father or male guardian. Results indicated that all self-disclosure and disclosiveness factors were negatively related to loneliness. Stepwise regression showed that positive disclosiveness, honesty of disclosiveness, depth of disclosure, and amount of disclosure were uniquely related to loneliness scores. A series of multiple regressions revealed nonlinear trends for depth of self-disclosure and depth of disclosiveness in relationship to loneliness. More loneliness was significant and negatively related to the child's self-disclosure. In child-parent combinations, son-father, daughter-father, and daughter-mother disclosure relationships were all significantly different in loneliness scores.

Two case studies that have received much attention involve two political science professors: Dr. Terry Anderson of Texas A &amp; M University, and Dr. Mark Reader of Arizona State University. Dr. Anderson was targeted by AIA reportedly for stating in class that he did not believe in the institution of marriage, that he was an atheist and that he held no patriotic ties with Texas A &amp; M, the flag, or America. Dr. Anderson filed a defamation and libel suit against the organization because the story could affect employability were he to seek another position. Dr. Reader was accused by AIA of using his &quot;Political Ideologies&quot;  course as a forum for protesting nuclear armament. Dr. Reader did not respond with a law suit, but rather wrote letters to the American Political Science Association explaining his position, and sought a university policy that would prohibit unregistered individuals (&quot;classroom spies&quot;) from attending classes for the purpose of gathering information to be used against the university or individual professors. The actions of AIA have reinforced the beliefs of many in the liberal arts who have denied intellectual standing to much of modern neoconservatism on the grounds that it stifles rather than nurtures intellectual and academic freedom.

        "description":"Rhetoricians since Plato's day have been concerned with how much knowledge speakers should possess in order to speak effectively as well as ethically. The expert, like anyone, can err, but the chance of factual error decreases when speakers have a thorough grasp of their subject matter. However, the expertise position can potentially become a means of repressing public expression and quelling challenges to authority. Classical scholars Antonius, Sulpicius, and Gorgias did not require orators to possess specialized knowledge, while Plato and Crassus endorsed thorough education and training as a prerequisite to effective speech. Scaevola favored expertise as a requirement for speech, but believed such knowledge remains in the domain of field-specific specialization, not in the  realm of oratory. Many modern dilemmas revolve around these same arguments. Physicians, for instance, are experts in their field, but their authority often goes unchecked by the public, and they often escape responsibility for their actions and medical developments. The public relations problems that surrounded the Three Mile Island incident stemmed from the inability of technical experts to agree with one another and to appease the public's need for reassurance and forthrightness. Such instances indicate that rhetoric should remain within the public or generalist realm, for when it retreats from public accountability, it becomes a tool for manipulation by an elite instead of a means of maintaining and reinforcing the human community.

        "description":"While presenting a critical look at selected aspects of relationship change research and theory, this essay argues that researchers need to investigate a broader range of relationship types, develop a more comprehensive conceptualization of relationship change, and develop more appropriate research methods. The first section deals with the need to investigate relations other than those that are attraction-based (friendship, heterosexual dating, or marriage), so that researchers can see how other factors that initiate relationships, such as kinship, economic necessity, or the requirements for cooperative action, can be understood. The second section contends that researchers must take a broader view of relationship change and stresses the need to determine the inadequacies of the  developmental-growth model. Possible alternate models suggested are the generative-transformational model used in theoretical linguistics, and a &quot;trajectory&quot; model of relationship change. The third section elaborates on the need for more appropriate research designs, pointing out difficulties in the area of subject selection, where current work tends to rely too heavily on the college student population. Observation techniques also are criticized, because current studies rely on self-reports in hypothetical situations to the exclusion of investigating real-life interactions. Finally, the paper addresses problems with the inclusion of time in research designs, noting that far too few longitudinal studies are being conducted. Five pages of references are appended. (SKC)",

        "description":"A field study conducted in Israel sought to identify emblematic gestures (body movements that convey specific messages) that are recognized and used by Hebrew speakers. Twenty-six gestures commonly used in classroom interaction were selected for testing, using Schneller's form, &quot;Investigations of Interpersonal Communication in Israel.&quot; The 26 gestures were decoded by 200 college students (Group I). Selected gestures were also decoded by 75 subjects (Group II), including college students and members of YMCA classes for pensioners. Participants noted their recognition and interpretations of the investigator's encoding intentions, their certainty of interpretation, and where they learned each gesture. Results of the study showed: (1) that eight gestures were identifiable as emblems,  and three more were identifiable as possible emblems; (2) that there were slightly negative although insignificant correlations found between increased age, years spent in Israel, expressed certainty of interpretation, and accuracy of interpretation; and (3) that natives and subjects from 20 to 24 years of age tended to have the highest rates of expressed certainty of interpretation as well as accuracy of interpretation. Although the study used a less than representative sample, and lacked a unified gesture labelling system, the study yielded useful information about non-verbal communication systems in Israel, and suggested that comparison with similar studies could produce a comprehensive picture of emblematic gestures used in various cultures.

The introduction defines communication skills as essential learning in education that consists of speaking, reading, writing, listening, viewing, and other forms of nonverbal communication, and the first chapter goes into further detail about what communication across the curriculum entails. The second chapter deals with literacy as a common essential learning, and discusses how literacy relates to communication across the curriculum and standard English. The third chapter presents a rationale that describes  what communication across the curriculum is and is not, while the fourth chapter describes the organization of the communication across the curriculum skills matrix used in the recommended curriculum. The role of the teacher in communication across the curriculum is discussed in the fifth chapter, and the sixth chapter is concerned with communication across the curriculum in Canada. Recommendations are enumerated in the seventh chapter, while the scope and sequence of the curriculum program is spelled out in the eighth chapter.

        "description":"While numerous journal articles have praised student broadcast internships as a way for universities to provide &quot;practical&quot; experience rather than just academic training for future jobs, internships are also problematic for students and instructors in many ways. When students work for a particular radio or television station, they learn the practices of that station, sometimes with inadequate grounding in theory. Consequently, the ideas a student brings back from an internship often conflict with what is taught in courses, and students may later be unprepared to adapt to the working procedures in a different station. Moreover, intern labor is often unpaid, the interns working only for the experience in hopes of obtaining a job after graduation. Professors, too, are often  overloaded in supervising internships because such duties are frequently added to a normal teaching load with no extra compensation. Since universities generally cannot afford the equipment necessary to make university training helpful to the student, and since students do need practical training in the field of broadcasting, internships are probably necessary, but they should not be the most important type of training universities offer to students. Rather internships, and the journal articles that extol them, should be examined with a healthy skepticism. (JC)",

        "description":"Acceptance of a paradigm in the scientific community depends upon persuasion, upon the supplying of &quot;good reasons&quot; for supporting one paradigm over another. When one paradigm gains long-term acceptance and becomes the standard for scientific thought, scientists defer to such an authority in their thinking, and such established paradigms serve to guide the practice of science. Consequently, when in the course of a scientific revolution a new paradigm is offered as a challenge to old standards of thinking, the burden of proof is on the challenger, who must now prove good reasons for the shift based on principles of argumentation. Before scientific revolutions occur, an established paradigm has presumption over all challenging theoretical frameworks until sufficient proof is adduced  against it. Scientists help to entrench such frameworks by specialized vocabulary and skills which narrow their vision and increase their resistance to change. Paradigms that challenge existing thought, unless they can be accommodated by the old framework, will meet resistance from researchers whose work is grounded in the established paradigm and students who traditionally defer to authority. Once a paradigm has successfully challenged an older framework, it will continue to be regarded as a counter-presumption until it, too, becomes the norm and no longer must defend itself.

        "description":"A comparison of the current television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; with the &quot;film noir&quot; genre of American movies from the forties and fifties reveals many similar elements, such as visual style, mood, theme, and sensibility. &quot;Miami Vice&quot; is set in a large city whose art deco architecture provides an ironic contrast to noir's pessimistic themes. Film noir's techniques emphasize loss, nostalgia, lack of clear priorities and insecurity, and then submerge these self-doubts in mannerism and style. Two selected episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; deal specifically with the criminal &quot;double,&quot; a motif often used in later &quot;film noir.&quot; One critic has suggested that the core dilemma of the TV show is whether or not the police officers will surrender themselves to the world of vice. In one episode in which the  character of Crockett is tracking a cat burglar, the story makes extensive use of doubles linking the detective with both a burglar and a psychotic policeman who is also pursuing the burglar. The climax brings the noir, double, and Jungian psychology themes together. A camera shot frames Crockett with his double, and in the next scene a stark close-up of the criminal's face becomes Crockett's face as the criminal looks away. When the burglar hurls something forward, breaking a mirror, Crockett awakens from what seems to be a dream. The popular television series, &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; appears to be continuing the &quot;film noir&quot; tradition into the eighties. References and 18 figures (frames from the television series illustrating the points discussed) are attached. (NKA)",

        "description":"American foreign policy must operate within the parameters of public opinion, and governmental and non-governmental actors must educate the characteristically alienated citizenry concerning policy issues. Since rational discourse is of limited benefit in the process, advocates instead use verbal representations or metaphor to instill within the public acceptance or rejection of policy. Metaphor (in the form of emotive symbols and narratives) sometimes evolves into a rhetorical icon that controls the legitimacy of foreign policy and subsequent governmental actions. This iconic perspective suggests the rationale for the often paradoxical state of U.S. foreign policy. The outcome of the Reykjavik (Iceland) Meeting in October 1986 between President Reagan and Soviet Chairman  Gorbachev was especially problematic for the American government because of the continuation of the Strategic Defense Initiative as a viable policy. To defuse this problem, Reagan administration staff pursued the strategy of redefining the meetings by using emotive symbols to link SDI with an insurance policy or an effective shield and by using narratives that illustrated the tenacity of Reagan in dealing with the Soviets, thus emphasizing a strong presidency. This rhetorical bonding of SDI by metaphor allowed the White House to redefine the failed Iceland summit meeting as successful. If the aftermath cements SDI as an icon, SDI will be difficult to eliminate. This iconological approach of the U.S. government indicates why its commitments sometimes become impractical or dangerous  international policies. (Sixty-six footnotes are appended.) (NKA)",

        "description":"Noting that one way to tap into organizational life involves examining the symbolic discourse occurring in the context, a study examined stories and metaphors, forms of symbolic discourse, in two Christian denominations in Southern Appalachia. Transcriptions from audiotapes of sermons and lay talks (e.g., Sunday School lessons) from Church of God and from Southern Baptist congregations in five counties were drawn from a larger data set in the Southern Appalachian Studies, collected in the late 1950s. These materials were analyzed for content. Findings revealed similarities and differences between the two organizations, and showed that stories and metaphors served to highlight themes consistent with organizational values in each church. Corresponding recurrent themes centered on  three main areas: the Trinity, the individual, and the process of salvation, but differing thematic emphases underscored the fundamental differences in the belief structures of the two denominations. A total of 35 stories were identified. In both churches, biblical stories were employed the most, followed by collegial and then personal stories. Southern Baptists used stories more frequently than those in the Church of God, and used these stories to underscore a greater range of themes. Differences were notable in both the quantity and quality of the thematic contents. The study demonstrates the value of examining religious institutions as organizational cultures, and the utility of qualitative methods of examining churches. It has delineated the fundamental qualities of each organization,  challenging the stereotypes usually associated with religion of the Appalachian region. (HTH)",

        "description":"A study examined the effect of assigned social decision rule (whether a jury is required to give a unanimous or less than unanimous verdict) on the process and product of mock jury deliberations. Subjects, 360 students from an eastern university, were randomly assigned to six-member juries under three decision rule conditions: (1) unanimity, (2) five-sixths majority, and (3) two-thirds majority. After viewing a videotape of a criminal trial, subjects completed a pre-deliberation questionnaire, using the cognitive response method, about the arguments advanced by the prosecution and defense during the trial, and their level of importance to each side. The quantity and quality of arguments recalled were the dependent variables. Subjects then deliberated until the assigned social  decision rule was reached. Upon completing deliberation, subjects filled out a post-deliberation questionnaire. The research design employed was a split-plot repeated measures design, with one &quot;between&quot; factor and two &quot;within&quot; factors. Results showed that jurors assigned to unanimous decision conditions recalled significantly more arguments than either majority rule condition, and had significantly higher ratings for the importance of the arguments recalled after deliberation. The findings suggest that unanimous juries are preferable because they recall more ideas to work with in deliberating, and consider the arguments more carefully. Additionally, other members of the jury seem to be persuaded by jurors presenting numerous, compelling, and unique arguments for a particular side.

        "description":"During 1986, a movement against the production and sale of pornography brought together two extremely different factions--radical feminists and evangelical church groups. The two groups' reasons for attacking pornography and their tactics in attempting to halt its production and distribution differ significantly. Feminists have argued that pornography is a systematic way for men to oppress women and perpetuate the myth that women secretly enjoy sexual abuse. They have sought evidence of a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of pornography and violence against women, citing, among other sources, the final report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography. They have unsuccessfully supported legislation against pornography on the grounds that such material  violates women's civil rights. Evangelicals have been more successful in convincing legislators to censor pornography. They, too, have looked toward empirical research, seeking evidence that pornography undermines the family. Their ability to convince legislators of pornography's harmful effects has caused the removal of &quot;Playboy&quot; and other magazines from convenience stores and libraries, and, in one case, the banning of 64 &quot;explicit&quot; books from schools. The evangelical groups' economic approach seems to be more effective, but the feminist tactics could be more successful if they modified their definitions of pornography to more closely approximate previous definitions.

        "description":"Noting that loss of control is a major concern confronting patients experiencing an illness, this paper critically analyzes the research literature on control and clarifies the implications of this research for provider-patient communication. The paper first defines control, noting that the most frequently cited definition is the &quot;locus of control&quot; perspective, which categorizes perceptions of control as internal or external. The paper then examines what patients are likely to want to control, such as environment, treatment, and relationships with care providers. The reasons control is important for patients are then discussed, followed by descriptions of three conceptualizations of control and how they apply to the patient-provider relationship. The first concerns locus of  control research, which examines whether patients believe they are responsible for their illness, or attribute it to outside forces. The behavior perspective is then addressed, which looks at how patients respond to their situations, followed by a discussion of the relational control perspective, which looks at control as a process. A summary notes that further research is needed on ways these perspectives contribute to an understanding of control in provider-patient communication. Five pages of references are included. (JC)",

It was hypothesized that students who used subliminal tapes to improve public speaking ability would perform no differently from classmates who listened to identical-sounding placebo tape programs containing no subliminal messages. Subjects, 26 students at a midwestern university, were divided into subliminal tape and placebo tape groups. Comparison of pretest and posttest surveys did not support the hypothesis. Although placebo group members evaluated their own confidence, improvement, and enjoyment higher than the subliminal group, the average final course grade of the experimental (subliminal) group was higher than that of the control  (placebo) group.

        "description":"Although the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, also known as the Meese Commission, has been criticized excessively at times for threatening freedom of speech and press and individual rights to privacy, an analysis of its &quot;Final Report&quot; reveals numerous deficiencies in the Commission's decision-making process. These deficiencies, apparently influenced by initial biases and strongly held beliefs about the ill effects of pornography, are evident in the Commission's conception of the problem, the unwarranted inferences from which it drew conclusions, and the reliance on questionable causal relationships as the source of many of its recommendations. The report suggests that the members were unable to keep values, tastes, and prior beliefs disentangled from facts. The  Commission did not develop a definition of pornography, but rather divided offensive, sexually explicit material into four categories: (1) sexually violent; (2) nonviolent, but depicting degradation, domination, subordination, or humiliation; (3) nonviolent and nondegrading; and (4) nudity. The various classifications were considered in relation to evidence establishing harm, either of a primary or a secondary nature. These classifications suffered from at least as much ambiguity as the term pornography itself. The Commission was divided over the validity of the nonviolent and nondegrading category and dismissed the relevance of the nudity category. Thus, they were left with three categories, one of which was a question even in their own minds. Additionally, the Commission found no  evidence of a direct cause and effect relationship between pornography and violence against women or children, but chose to infer one out of &quot;common sense.&quot; The Commission's approach appears to have been based on a prior presumption of a need for certain legislative proposals, for which rationales in available information were then sought.

        "description":"In a fifty-minute period, a class of speech students can be given an object lesson in listening skills. Materials needed are an article that can be read aloud in ten minutes, enough copies for class distribution, and a carefully composed list of ten to twelve questions. When the students arrive for the first class, the teacher reads the article aloud in a straightforward manner but without any emphasis on delivery. The students' relief at the end of the reading will turn to protest when they are asked to write answers to specific questions about the article. In going over the answers, the students usually find that they have only two or three correct, and offer explanations as to why they were not listening. By asking if the students' poor showing was all their fault, the teacher  opens up a discussion of what the teacher/speaker should have done, such as use more vocal expression, write key ideas on the board, or expand on complex issues. The teacher then supplies the class with copies of the article, and the class, feeling satisfied that the teacher shares the blame, believes that the lesson is over. But the discussion continues so that students can begin to see that they must learn to engage in critical or social listening and not place all of the burden of communication on the speaker. Positive feedback on this exercise encourages the students, and helps move listening to the conscious level. (NKA)",

        "description":"A study investigated the results of previous studies on the effectiveness of pictorial instruction, specifically examining whether the use of black-and-white pictorial instruction as a supplement to verbal instruction is more effective than the use of verbal instruction alone. Thirty-four studies on pictorial instruction that varied widely but that met certain criteria were used as samples for a meta-analysis. Results of the examination indicated that, across all studies analyzed, pictorial instruction was found to be significantly more effective than verbal instruction alone. Findings showed that specific level of pictorial instruction effectiveness was related to socioeconomic background, course content area, course difficulty level, time of exposure, mode of presentation,  stimulus detail, time of testing, and course objective. Findings also showed that studies in which different instructors were used in the experimental and control groups yielded higher levels of effectiveness than studies in which the same instructor was used. It is expected that if instructor characteristics had been controlled, the level of effectiveness would somewhat diminish but remain statistically significant.

        "description":"This essay reviews current policy issues regarding statewide educational databases. It begins by defining the major characteristics of a database and raising two questions: (1) Is it really necessary to have a statewide educational database? (2) What is the primary rationale for creating one? The limitations of databases in formulating educational policy are then assessed to consider how they may be linked to policy formation and decision-making processes. This linkage appears to operate on two levels: the rational/ideal level, in which management information in statewide databases is used to determine what is rationally true and ideally desired; and the pragmatic level, which takes into account social, political, economic, and emotional constraints. On account of the  proliferation of special programs, the growing demand for research data, and the growth of electronic data processing capabilities, state education agencies should adopt the following policy criteria for including information in a database: (1) clearly established needs; (2) clearly established definitions; (3) clearly established limits; (4) coordination of multiple databases; (5) a means for incorporating outside data, (6) a balance between technological and educational interests; and (7) proper regard for confidentiality and ownership, coupled with availability. Carefully planned, appropriately used, and constantly revised and upgraded databases can become the foundation of sound educational policy. (TE)",

After a historical review of the conditions in the 1960s that gave rise to collective bargaining units in higher education, recent alternatives and adjustments to the bargaining process are presented, as typified in the recent experience of Carl Sandburg College in Galesburg, Illinois. The college would avert direct confrontation. First, the administration and board gathered near- and long-term financial plans, identified alternatives, and set guidelines for bargaining; then they held a series of informal gatherings and seminars to create and maintain an atmosphere of optimal communication and trust, with both the faculty and the college community-at-large. This process helped the negotiating teams see the  impact of prospective bargaining issues on other employees and resources of the college. By the time negotiations were due to start, there was little discernible difference between the bargaining parties. The result was a brief and amicable negotiation process that reached closure in only five weekly sessions. Consideration of the evolving political and socioeconomic climate suggests that the possibility exists for such improvements in the collective bargaining process. (TE)",

Six committees made up of teachers, administrators, school board members, local business leaders, parents, and students from participating school districts studied and planned different aspects of the schools, including the curriculum, student selection procedures, and business operations. The Northern Chautauqua Project was ready to implement a half-day interdisciplinary program in the fall of 1987, but planning was suspended in January 1987, because no state funding was made available. This report documents the activities and findings of each committee in the Northern Chautauqua Project and provides an accounting of what was  accomplished and a guide for others who are planning similar programs in their own school districts. Major sections of the report cover the following: (1) Getting Started; (2) Project Committee Structure; (3) Business Operations; (4) Curriculum and Staffing; (5) Student Selection; (6) Parental Support; (7) Networking; and (8) Problems and Issues. The latter chapter includes discussions of funding, definition and acceptance of concepts, elitism, the need for a regional high school of excellence, accreditation, logistical problems, and teacher recruitment. The concluding chapter provides a set of crucial questions, recommendations, and suggestions. An index is included, and supporting materials from the project are appended. (TE)",

Data were drawn from a survey of organizational and curriculum arrangements in secondary schools, a study of teachers and students in a sample of 53 schools, and a series of studies based on field work in a selection of schools. Overall, data sources total 8,464 students comprising the sample from the 53 schools; and 1,646 teachers, representing a response rate of approximately 65 percent. Among the findings  were that teachers' job satisfaction was enhanced when there was frequent communication among staff and when they saw the curriculum as being well-coordinated. Students viewed the quality of school life more favorably when the curriculum recognized their diverse aptitudes and when the level of communication among their teachers was high. The report is presented in eight chapters with 35 tables and 71 references. The appendices contain technical notes on sampling, the school life questionnaire, and the teacher questionnaire along with 11 technical references. Copies of the three questionnaires are attached.

The report aims to restructure school administration. Separate chapters outline recommendations for public schools, professional organizations, universities, state and federal policymakers, and the private sector. Significant recommendations include: (1) redefining educational leadership; (2) establishing a National Policy Board on Educational Administration; (3) modeling administration preparation programs after those of other professional schools; (4) terminating at least 300 college and university educational administration programs; (5) initiating recruitment and placement programs for minorities and women; (6) requiring public schools' full partnership in preparing administrators; (7) creating management development opportunities; and (8)  reforming licensure programs.

        "description":"Comprehensive or nonselective schools have been in existence in the United Kingdom for over 40 years, having gradually replaced the old selective system of grammar schools for able pupils and secondary modern schools for less able pupils. In spite of their growth in numbers, comprehensive schools have been subject to continual controversy, and current government policies favor a return to forms of pupil selection and differentiation. This paper therefore begins with a review of the history of comprehensive schooling and the rationale for its adoption, and then assesses existing research into the effectiveness of selective and nonselective systems. The third section evaluates some of the effects of comprehensive schools on their pupils by examining an &quot;experiment of nature&quot; that  occurred when a community in Wales partially reorganized its schools, leaving a third of its pupils in a selective system and putting two-thirds into new nonselective comprehensive schools. A wide range of data were collected on the pupils entering the two systems, including personality characteristics, verbal ability, mathematical ability, and nonverbal ability or intelligence. Findings are tabulated and discussed for (1) cohort intake data for selective and comprehensive systems; (2) actual and predicted outcome scores for the two systems; (3) residuals and standard deviations; (4) catchment areas of the two systems; and (5) outcome results by ability groupings. Results indicate that the significantly poorer academic and social performance of comprehensive schools is largely due to poor  results with the middle third of the ability range who in the selective system attended the top streams of the secondary modern schools. A bibliography is included. (TE)",

        "description":"Increasingly, principals are being viewed as instructional leaders, professional educators active in initiating and planning teacher development programs. While most principals consider instructional leadership a high priority, they spend much of their time solving routine problems and confronting minor crises. Immediate, short-term responses take precedence over long-term instructional perspectives. School districts are establishing inservice programs to help principals move into new role expectations. This paper investigates the impact of a staff development process, designed for both teachers and principals, on 12 male secondary principals in a large urban school district. The principals had experience ranging from 5 to 21 years and had already undergone a district-operated  program of training to become instructional leaders. Respondents' perceptions of the program and its impact on their role were explored by a structured interview process organized around five areas: expectations, time requirements, support and training received, unexpected outcomes, and additional comments. Principals' comments and concerns were classified according to the school of thought or management style represented. Scientific management and organizational development dominated the principals' effectiveness focus, suggesting that principals' concerns were related to control and efficiency and to communications and teamwork. These and other results are discussed at length. Most principals favored the immediate and &quot;do-able&quot; task, realized their organizational linking role, and  believed that the staff development program increased their workload and stress. Included are 2 tables and 25 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"The rationale for high school dropout reduction programs rests mainly on evidence that graduates are more successful than dropouts in the labor market. It is not evident, however, whether this difference is attributable to the diploma itself or to underlying characteristics that affect both graduation and labor market success. This paper estimates the effect of the diploma on labor market success, over and above prior differences between graduates and dropouts, using a statistical procedure controlled for observable characteristics (ethnicity, gender, and academic achievement). The research also attempted to discover the role of unmeasured characteristics that may be associated with high school completion and labor market success. After selecting data from the 1980 sophomore  cohort in the \"High School and Beyond\" survey, comparisons were made between a group who left school without a diploma and a group who graduated but did not attend postsecondary school. Results indicate that differences in employment and earnings between teenagers with and without diplomas are primarily not attributable to differences in measured prior characteristics. Dropouts' labor market difficulties are therefore not merely symptomatic of the prior characteristics measured by this research. The question remains whether the problems are due to discrimination by employers against dropouts or to other unmeasured variables. Society's gain from dropout reduction programs depends on whether employers' reasons for favoring graduates are arbitrary or valid. Conversely, if dropouts have  unobserved characteristics causing them to be less productive than graduates, then society's gain from program efforts depends on whether would-be dropouts acquire characteristics during schooling that make them more productive. Seventeen references and 13 tables of data are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"Although scholars have developed and applied various explicit conceptualizations of leadership to the study of educational administration, far less attention has been given to implicit or informal conceptions of leadership. Some recent studies claim that leadership impact on organizational performance is minimal or illusory; others argue that more subtle, previously unexamined forms of influence may be operating. This study examines: (1) the extent to which educators distinguish between the notions of leader, formal leader, and informal leader; (2) the behaviors educators associate with the concept of leadership; and (3) whether subgroups among educators hold different implicit theories of leadership. The University of Utah College of Education furnished 168 student participants,  79 from educational studies, 36 from special education, and 53 from educational administration. A questionnaire divided into demographic, open-ended, and self-assessment sections was used. Students were asked to describe the behaviors of a formal leader, an informal leader, and a leader; they were also asked to rate their desire and capacity to serve in each leadership category. Findings suggest that participants shared a relatively coherent concept of leadership. Respondents' concepts of leader may be slightly more closely aligned with their concepts of formal than with informal leader. The leadership inclination section showed more mixed results. Included are 4 tables and 19 references. (MLH)",

This paper focuses on socioeconomic status (SES) as one social context variable demonstrating substantial predictive power in numerous school improvement studies. Instead of viewing middle class behavior as superior and lower class behavior as deficient, this paper explores how human variation may be exploited for the enrichment of all members of society. To this end, data from third-grade classes in 12 urban, suburban, and rural Louisiana school randomly selected districts were gathered during the 1982-83 school year, and six groups of schools were identified: (1) middle-SES effective schools, (2) middle-SES typical schools, (3) middle-SES  ineffective schools, (4) low-SES effective schools, (5) low-SES typical schools, and (6) low-SES ineffective schools. In one stage of this study, nine matched pairs of schools selected by regression techniques were examined. While findings disclosed definite similarities between effective middle- and low-SES schools, interesting dissimilarities were also revealed. Compared to their middle-SES counterparts, low-SES effective schools emphasize present expectations; offer more external rewards; hire initiator--instead of manager-principals; buffer schools from negative community influences when more positive outreach fails; hire younger, more idealistic teachers; and concentrate on basic skills.

        "description":"After World War II, enrollment in the Japanese educational system underwent an unprecedented expansion, largely on account of postwar economic growth. Although such expansion was common throughout the world, Japan's experience was unique because of the magnitude of changes in the enrollment rates and the degree to which these changes directly reflect popular demand rather than government intervention. Accordingly, this study is a systematic quantitative analysis relating the increased demand for education in Japan to economic variables. The study addresses three questions: (1) What caused the educational expansion? (2) How did it keep momentum for such a long period? and (3) Why did it finally lose momentum in the mid-1970s? After an introduction establishing the framework and  issues of analysis, the first chapter sets forth a theoretical framework by creating a model of individual choice from which the aggregate demand function of education can be derived. Chapter II examines internal rates of return of senior high school and college education from 1954 to 1980, and analyzes changes in the benefit-cost ratio over this period. Then alternative indicators of anticipated educational benefits are constructed, based on hypothetical models of rational expectation. Based on this analysis, chapter III presents the methods and results of a time-series regression analysis that discloses determining factors of the actual changes in enrollment rates. The original sources and methods of estimation of the data used in the text are appended: (1) the estimation of cohort  enrollment rates; (2) the wage-profile by education; (3) the direct costs of senior high school and college education; and (4) the time-series economic indicators. The last two appendices examine the difference between the United States and Japan and the gender differentials in economic returns to education. (TE)",

An initial examination of available 1985 light, heat, and water expenditures for 268 secondary schools (84 percent of the secondary schools in New Zealand) is followed by the selection of a number of schools for detailed investigation and for action. Three Wellington and four Christchurch schools were monitored with electronic dataloggers during winter 1986, both before and after action had been taken to improve energy management. In all cases remedial work was cost-effective, with pay-back times of not more than 2 years and in some cases of a few months. Savings in heating fuel costs through improved management ranged  from 30 percent to 50 percent, far exceeding original estimates. Techniques used included walk-through energy audits, replacement of timeclock boiler controls with self-adaptive optimum start/stop controllers, runhour meters, and repair of faulty controls. Recommendations for further action are given, and a basic approach to an improved energy management program for the Department of Education is outlined. Dispersed throughout the text are 19 tables and 41 figures, and 19 references are included.

The evaluative process can substantially affect productivity, employee commitment, and evaluation system stability. This study describes the characteristics of a state-mandated evaluation system for principals and the ways that satisfaction with the evaluation process is related to assessment methods, chosen criteria, and sources of evaluative information. Using prior studies and the Natriello and Dornbusch teacher evaluation model, a questionnaire was designed to gather data on methods of evaluating principals and their satisfaction with the process in a southern state employing a complex instrument. The study used  a random sample of 200 principals; the response rate was 74 percent. A slight majority (55.6 percent) were satisfied with their evaluation process, while 30 percent were unsatisfied and 21 percent voiced uncertain opinions. Other results concerning the effects of evaluation on principals, the specificity of criteria, the sources of evaluation information, and the statistical differences between satisfied and dissatisfied groups are summarized, with the help of 13 tables. The paper concludes that acceptance of a principal appraisal system is necessary to influence principals' actions positively.

This paper describes a school improvement model employed in four rural Maine school districts in which (1) a school climate assessment is designed collaboratively with school staff; (2) the assessment is conducted and the results summarized; and (3) staff, citizens, and consultants review the data for purposes of plannning school improvement. Research was based on two premises: school climate as an empirical issue and the validity of school members' perceptions as sources and determinants of the learning environment. The approach involved several steps, including (1) consulting school staff about problematical aspects of school climate; (2)  developing school climate instruments; (3) distributing and analyzing surveys; (4) reviewing results with school members; (5) pursuing selected findings; (6) generating multiple explanations for each climate condition identified; and (7) following up district action plans and evaluation efforts. Three lessons were learned from these successful consultations: (1) staff and citizens are receptive to survey results when involved in developing the instruments; (2) most school members are eager to read and discuss results; and (3) the staff development resulting from these steps often yields greater climate improvement than the action plan produced by the model.

        "description":"This paper describes an experiment in using the &quot;scenario,&quot; a concept parallel to that of the case study, as a research tool for obtaining information about possible sex discrimination in personnel decisions by high school principals in South Australia. A review of the literature indicated that in spite of legislation aimed at elimination of sex discrimination and the creation of agencies to enforce this legislation, sex role stereotyping in work roles for men and women was still commonplace. Accordingly, researchers used a survey-experiment research design to ascertain the existence, extent, and nature of sex discrimination in situations demanding personnel decisions. Respondents assumed the role of executive vice president in a hypothetical organization and were provided with  ll scenarios requiring managerial decisions involving selection, promotion, development, supervision, discipline, and various kinds of personal conflicts. Two versions of the questionnaire were prepared, with sex roles reversed for key figures in each scenario. Findings, displayed in tables, reveal that some scenarios present no difficulties regarding the principal's decision, whether the staff member is a male or female teacher. Although replies to Scenario 6 implied that decisions on personal problems are likely to indicate sex discrimination, and replies to Scenario 9 implied that a man's career was considered more important than that of a woman, findings did not support any general conclusion that school principals consistently differentiate between men and women in their personnel  decisions.

Although the primary variable for investigation is attendance rate, other school system variables examined include type of school, percentage of low-income students in a school, and the overall level of student ability for a school as indicated by average reading scores. Chapter 1 provides statistics on enrollment and dropout rates for each of the four types of high schools in the Chicago system: selective academic, selective vocational, nonselective integrated (consisting of at least 30% white students), and nonselective segregated (consisting primarily of minority students). Chapter 2 provides statistics on the percentage of low-income students, average reading  scores, school attendance rates, and school dropout rates for each type of school. The third chapter documents the process of recording attendance rates through sample attendance report forms submitted by high school principals during the 1984 school year. Chapter 4 is a critique of the state funding formula, arguing that it results in a lack of monetary incentive to reduce the dropout rate and chronic truancy. The final chapter relates the dropout rates of schools to attendance records, showing that schools with high dropout rates had proportionally fewer days of attendance than schools with low dropout rates. A system of reimbursement based on rewarding school systems on a per diem basis for student attendance is therefore recommended. References are included. (TE)",

In addition, for the hearing children, a language age was computed, using a combined auditory  comprehension and verbal ability scale from the Preschool Language Scale. Peer social behavior was randomly sampled, with recordings made of frequency and level of social interactions, and frequency and levels of communicative initiations and responses. The observed frequencies and levels of social interactions of hearing impaired children were lower than the observed frequencies and levels of interactions of hearing subjects in all four age groups. Although hearing impaired subjects had lower levels of communicative initiations and responses, by age five or six, they had higher frequencies in both initiation and response categories than hearing subjects. Results suggested that the major differences between hearing and hearing impaired subjects were in communicative behavior rather than  in social behavior. (CL)",

Trends in the transition literature are noted regarding service delivery models for LD adults in postsecondary settings, including specially trained peer tutors to help LD students in subject areas. Research about vocational rehabilitation's role with LD adolescents and adults is also discussed. The multi-faceted nature of the transition problem is stressed. (CL)",

The scale contains six subscales: perception of general ability, perception of arithmetic ability, general school satisfaction, perception of reading and spelling ability, perception of penmanship and neatness, and confidence in academic ability. Significant group effects were found for the full scale and for all subscales except school satisfaction and penmanship/neatness. A virtual lack of significant group by time interaction effects indicated relative stability in self-perceptions of ability over  the 2-year period for both groups. (Author/CL)",

A battery of cognitive, receptive and expressive language, and adaptive behavior measures was administered. Results did not support the hypothesis: daily living and socialization skills were impaired in adolescents with severe language disorder as much as their performance in formal language tests. Receptive ability appeared to better predict adaptive skill than IQ or expressive ability.  Among conclusions drawn were that although the disorders of language acquisition might appear quite specific in early childhood, they actually have a pervasive effect on overall development; and, unlike retarded individuals, students with primary communication deficits fail to progress in social and daily living skills.

It is noted that with pre-judging, tasks should be quite familiar, short, and discrete entities. Inferred self-assessment, in which students indicate they cannot perform difficult or impossible tasks, is also considered. Specific self-assessment techniques are reviewed, as are self-monitoring approaches. Among conclusions noted is that learning disabled students appear to have specific deficits in the area of  self-assessment itself; the problem may manifest itself in reading, writing and spelling, math, language communication, social status, and attention-to-task skills.

Findings are briefly reviewed in terms of the amount of time spent using the computer, social and free play choices, software selection preferences, amount of teacher assistance required, and computer access considerations. An examination of existing software suggests that the majority of the programs use the keyboard as a primary means of response, a level of skill that many young handicapped children do not possess and that many programs have been developed without an adequate research base. Access considerations are also covered, and a procedure for assessing a child's computer abilities outlined  in six steps is described.

In five regional seminars, 245 educators representing 46 state or other educational agencies were trained. Dissemination of the I'M SPECIAL Instructional Modules, a series of 15 color-sound videotapes and print materials concerning physical education for handicapped elementary students,  was a second goal of the project. A total of 232 sets were distributed or reproduced. State plans were also developed for the coordinated delivery of preservice and inservice training experiences for teachers of physical education for handicapped students. The report describes results of participant evaluations and documents total number of viewings of the modules since 1984. Among six recommendations which conclude the report is one urging the establishment of a Center for Research and Education in Physical Education for Handicapped Students.

        "description":"The manual presents guidelines for developing a special education service delivery system that are flexible enough to accommodate individual needs of local education agencies (LEAs) in Minnesota. Following a general introduction, the manual is organized in three sections: (1) description of essential components in the special education system; (2) an internal evaluation and improvement process; (3) a planning process for special education change. Each section begins with an introduction which provides background information (e.g., purpose, scope, and implementation suggestions). The first two sections are structured according to 15 program components (each of which has a stated standard): identification, referral, assessment, individual program planning, instructional delivery/  programs, staff, physical plant, parent involvement/due process, personnel development, interagency cooperation, transportation, instructional resources, community relations, fiscal resources, and governance. The third section outlines a 10-step planning process for change: scan the environment, analyze conditions, develop planning assumptions, develop a mission statement, develop a statement of philosophy, review and analyze special education description and improvement data, formulate goals and objectives, obtain approval, implement plan, evaluate and adjust. Six appendices include the full text of the 15 program standards, a list of resources, and explanations of terms related to data collection and evaluation procedures. (JW)",

        "description":"Meta-analysis was used to conduct an integrative review of the research on modifying attitudes toward persons with disabilities. Prior reviews, using small samples and lacking systematic data collection and analysis, were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of attitude modification techniques. In the hope of correcting these deficiencies, an exhaustive search of all English-language research reports in the United States and Canada was undertaken that identified 667 potentially relevant items. Screening for relevance and adequacy of information reduced the accessible population for the integrative review to 273 reports describing a total of 644 treatment groups. A coding instrument containing some 162 categories was used . Data analysis is detailed for the  following: inter-rater reliability, global quality indicators, specific validity threats, measurement concerns, study populations and samples, replications, qualification of results, treatment outcomes, comparison of experimental treatments, treatment variability, and concomitant variables. The major conclusion was that clear-cut indications of the overall efficiency of techniques for modifying attitudes toward disabled persons or of reliable differences in efficacy were not found.

During the first year (1983-84) of the data base development phase the project conducted the following data collection activities: testing of 123 handicapped preschoolers with the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI); documentation of type and quantity of service provided; survey of parents regarding degree of satisfaction with their child's special education program. Major findings included the following: (1) with the exception of gross motor skills,  Project children exhibited significant improvements in all areas of development beyond that expected by maturation alone; (2) the largest gains were in the areas of personal-social and cognitive skills; (3) children labeled multihandicapped made significant gains in all areas but motor skills; (4) children labeled &quot;articulation disordered&quot; or &quot;language disordered&quot; made gains but not in speech and language areas; (5) parents reported overwhelming satisfaction with their preschool child's program; (6) service providers did not use BDI test results in educational planning or discussions with parents. The body of the report details methodology, results, the parent satisfaction survey, and supplementary BDI validation studies. Appendixes include the parents' evaluation questionnaire, the BDI  questionnaire, and additional information about the &quot;value-added analysis&quot; approach employed in the study methodology.

The program's main components--a regional case management system, a computerized information system, and an interagency council--were designed to address three major state mandated goals: provision of a complete array of services to SED students; improvement of existing services; and continuous multiagency planning, implementation, and evaluation of services. Evaluation methodology included survey instruments, interviews, and examination of relevant records/documents. Major findings of the evaluation included the following: an increase  in the numbers of students identified as SED though fewer services per student were provided; improvement in communication, coordination, and cooperation among school programs and agencies; no improvement in the time interval before a student begins receiving services; improvement in the flow of information and implementation of the computerized information system; and provision of case management services by Network staff. Among recommendations are continuation of the project, increased funding levels, and provision of inservice training to agency staff. Appendices include the school/agency survey instrument and the interagency council interview form. (DB)",

Class discussion covering the topic, organization, and role of the language used follows. The attention given to  existing native language writing skills builds confidence and de-emphasizes the writing process, with which many students from traditional school systems are uncomfortable.

Three translations produced by 20 students in their second year of an advanced English translation program at the Dutch State School of Translation, were analyzed for variability in the translation of Dutch modal verbs. It was proposed that the student's ability to resolve the difficulties of translating those forms would be a good predictor of his or her overall performance. It was found that while students do vary in their ability to produce acceptable translations, there are also many other factors that may interfere with analysis, such as differences in context, frequency of modal occurrence in texts, and the presence of other translation problems. Further  research on the quantification of variability is recommended, and a heuristic rather than prescriptive approach to translation instruction is also proposed. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study investigated the readability of current laws for Canadian francophones and anglophones. The 63 subjects were asked to read a variety of brief legal texts available in parallel styles in both languages and to answer questions about the texts' content. Subjects were also surveyed about their preference for a formal or vulgarized style of legal writing and their feelings about legal language, and demographic information. The results suggest that (1) legal texts are comprehensible to citizens of at least a tenth-grade education; (2) most people are mystified by the legal world to the point of doubting their own capacity to read and understand legal texts; and (3) preventive legal education is essential for all citizens, both to facilitate socio-legal action and to improve  access to legal information. Vulgarization of legal texts is not recommended as the optimal solution to improving this access. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study investigated the reason for the high performance of bilingual children on a syllogistic reasoning task. Thirty-nine Puerto Rican Spanish-English bilingual children in grades 3 through 6 were asked to solve problems in both languages. Response times were recorded, and the subjects were asked to justify their answers to assess to what extent reasoning led to task success. Response times were found to be longer if the justification given reflected reasoning, but it was also found that students needed more time to give an answer in their stronger language (Spanish) than in their weaker one (English). In addition, solution accuracy and solution strategy did not interact and the strategies used to solve syllogisms were manifested differently at different grade levels. In the  lower grades, the justification given seemed to reflect whether or not the student understood the purpose of the task, and in higher grades, the justification appeared to show whether the student succeeded in his reasoning effort or used a default strategy to solve the problem. Performance above the chance level is attributable to the characteristics of the syllogism rather than to what the subjects did with them, suggesting that strategy rather than success is a better source of information about children's performance.

An initial chapter introduces the Finnish particle clitics and their characteristics and status. A second chapter presents a syntactic account of (sentential) connective and epistemic adverbs and the closely related class of conjunctions, within the framework of generalized phrase structure grammar, to illustrate how Finnish particle clitics are related to independent words that function as sentential adverbs. A third chapter identifies syntactic, semantic, and prosodic properties common to the sentential  adverbs and particle clitics, and another chapter reviews the literature on cliticization. Finally, a discussion of the morphosyntactic status of the particle clitics is presented, offering some external evidence for the bound word status of second position clitics. Appended materials include notes on bound words in the Finnish lexicon and a brief comparison of Finnish and Lappish morphology. (MSE)",

Hutchins's undergraduate work was done at Oberlin College and Yale University, and he received his law degree from Yale. He served as a lecturer and dean of the Yale Law School and was a successful fund raiser in a number of posts. He was an administrator at age 21 and at age 30 he became president of the University of Chicago, where he had a 22-year tenure. During Hutchin's second career, he served at the Ford Foundation's Fund for  the Republic, which was devoted to the study of American freedom and civil liberties. He was the founder of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions at Santa Barbara. His book, &quot;The Higher Learning in America,&quot; advocated that college learning should be pervasively intellectual rather than a means to develop character or prepare for a vocation. Other ideas expressed in the book and contemporary critical reviews are considered. (SW)",

Ninety-five percent of administrators support assessment that is closely tied to instructional improvement efforts, and 7 in 10 administrators believe that assessment should be linked to institutional planning and budgeting. Almost all colleges have recently made changes in the curriculum or are currently doing so, especially to strengthen general education  and to emphasize writing, mathematics, and other general competencies expected of college students. The overall budget, and the budget for educational and general expenses, increased for most institutions. However, 12% of colleges reported a decrease.

At the post-primary (second level) of Irish education, 3 years of study lead to the Intermediate Certificate examination. Study can be college preparatory, vocational, or comprehensive, a combination of college preparatory and vocational. An additional 2 or 3 years of coursework leads to the Leaving Certificate examination. Points on this examination are assigned for subjects tested, and the total points received by the  student determine acceptance for third level education as well as the course of study to which the student will be assigned from among the student's preferences. The university program usually requires 3 years for an arts degree and 4 years for a science degree. There is much competition for limited number of places in courses that are considered prestigious and likely to lead to jobs.

Data from the High School and Beyond survey 1980 sophomore cohort were used to estimate the probability of attending two-year and four-year colleges for blacks and whites, given changes in black achievement levels. The analysis indicates that if the gap between blacks and whites was reduced by 50%, the chances of attending a postsecondary school for a black student with average achievement would increase by nine percentage points. If there was a 75% reduction in the achievement gap, black and white students would be about equally likely to attend postsecondary schools, and if the achievement gap was eliminated, there would be a higher  attendance rate for blacks than for whites. Potential increases in attendance would be reflected primarily at four-year colleges, particularly at the higher achievement levels. The statistical model and procedures for calculating the impact of increasing achievement of blacks on postsecondary attendance are described. Data are included on the estimated simulated effects on college attendance as average reading and math achievement are increased for black students. (SW)",

        "description":"The use of part-time faculty in baccalaureate nursing programs and the views of part-timers about part-time employment were studies in two phases. The first phase was a descriptive exploration of the use of part-time faculty conducted in 1979 using questionnaires completed by administrative officers. Responses from administrators of 91 institutions represented 36 states and the District of Columbia. Nursing departments reported an average number of 23 full-time and 5 part-time faculty. In the second study phase, conducted in 1983, 515 usable questionnaires were received from a sample of 800 part-time faculty members, who averaged 2.9 years in their present part-time positions. The women in the sample had a mean of 12.5 years experience in the profession. Administrators indicated  that they expected a weekly time commitment of 18 hours from part-time faculty and 25 hours from full-timers. More than a quarter of the respondents indicated that they desired a part-time career. It is suggested that these faculty should be eligible for the same pay rate as full-timers and prorated benefits for committee, advising, and other duties. It is concluded that unless the reward system approximates part-timers' responsibilities, there may be serious results for the process and quality of higher education and for the status of women faculty in particular.

Information is provided on salaries by faculty rank and sex and by type and control of institution. Faculty pay in 1986 was 3% to 6% lower in purchasing power than in 1976-1977. Although salaries decreased at each rank, the average salary in constant dollars for all ranks remained almost unchanged over the 10 years, $32,600 in 1976-1977 and $32,400 in 1985-1986. The reason is that a higher proportion of faculty became professors and earned the highest faculty salaries. While average salaries between ranks showed consistent patterns, there were  variations by rank within institutional type (universities, other four-year, and two-year) and control (public or private). In 1985-1986 public universities' average salaries of $36,200 were 9.1% less than the $39,800 earned at private institutions. In other four-year institutions, a different pattern emerged in average faculty salaries. As in 1976-1977, average faculty salaries for men in 1985-1986 were considerably higher than for women.

A special advisory committee consisting of representatives of professional nursing and other organizations, hospitals, and experts in rural health care would be established to develop a plan specifying long-term solutions to the problems experienced by hospitals and health care institutions in recruiting and retaining professional nurses. The bill authorizes a grant to a nonprofit private entity for a project to demonstrate and evaluate innovative hospital nursing practice models designed to reduce vacancies in hospital nursing positions and to make the hospital nursing  position a more attractive career choice. The bill authorizes grants to and contracts with collegiate schools of nursing to demonstrate and evaluate innovative nursing practice models related to the provision of long-term care in the home or in long-term care facilities. The bill also authorizes grants and contracts to operate regional model professional nurse recruitment centers to recruit students for professional nursing education programs. (SW)",

The campus contribution to student aid programs has grown far more than recent tuition increases. A significant portion of the financial aid burden has passed from federal government to public and private colleges since 1980. The data reveal that freshman participation in the Pell Grant program has declined by nearly half since 1980, while freshman participation in the Guaranteed Student Loan program has increased by almost one-fourth from 1980 to 1985. Between fall 1980 and 1986, participation in the Pell Grant program fell by an estimated 267,000 first-time, full-time freshman. To provide financial aid to  students, colleges are using college funds that otherwise would go to salaries, program enhancement, and facility repairs/improvements. New eligibility reductions implemented over the past 6 years mean that many families who were eligible for Pell support in 1980 were not eligible for aid in 1986. The impact of changes in student aid on student choice, outcomes for the educational infrastructure, and issues confronting families are addressed. (SW)",

Because access to college is a major concern, the ICHE places highest priority on Title IV, dealing with student aid. Congress is urged to continue Title IV at the current funding level. Since  campus facility deterioration and aging are a common issue, the next priority is Title VII, Construction, Reconstruction, and Renovation of Academic Facilities. When the federal government's fiscal condition permits, a focus should be funding to repair college buildings, especially laboratory facilities.

A telephone survey of U.S. universities with undergraduate enrollment over 20,000 and that offer graduate programs was conducted, and 27 of 31 universities responded. Universities with known mandatory programs were also contacted. Three major issues were identified: the substantial numbers of  students without health care insurance; the importance of carefully marketing student health insurance; and the key players who may be affected by a mandatory health insurance policy (e.g., students, student health centers, local providers, the insurance company).

By combining Baldridge's Political Decision Making Model with Wildavsky's Clientele Strategy, the &quot;Political Clientele Model&quot; is proposed as a framework to analyze the process of constructing student funded recreational facilities. The process at the University of Arizona is used to illustrate the model. Guidelines for implementing similar projects at other institutions are drawn from the University of Arizona's experience. The political model takes into account that: people choose not to participate in making decisions, which are left to administrators or small groups of elites; there is fluid participation of people who experience varying interests and pressures; there are  interest group pressures; conflict is unavoidable; negotiated compromises to conflict place limitations on formal authority; and external interest groups also exert pressure. Based on the political clientele mode, a successful financing campaign for recreational facility construction should involve: identifying and organizing clientele, expanding the clientele, serving the clientele, securing feedback, and working within the structure.

Program innovations implemented at Cochise College (Arizona) to serve basic skills education students are described. Community colleges face a new issue of how to educate the diverse students they receive, especially the underprepared. What is needed is a method of separating those students who have an existing capacity to do academic work from those whose aptitude needs to be developed through remediation. One approach is to incorporate basic skills courses in traditional department offerings. At Cochise College each program is individually designed to meet the specific  remediation needs of a student. In Arizona 43% of the community colleges allow some remedial coursework to meet graduation requirements. At Cochise College, 6 of the 60 semester hours required for graduation are allowed to be from remedial classes. (SW)",

        "description":"The extensive education and training programs established and run by business and industry for their own employees are discussed. The extent of corporate education is assessed with attention to cost, participation, providers, curricula, methods of instruction, organization, evaluation, and corporate colleges. Historical developments concerning employer-sponsored instruction are traced, and it is suggested that there is no longer a sharp distinction between corporate training and collegiate education. Some corporate colleges were begun by companies to educate specialists for their industrial needs. For traditional education, a degree-granting institution must receive recognition from the state, and there is also program and course recognition and licensing of individuals from  accredited programs. Ways that corporate-sponsored education is extended legal recognition are identified, along with reasons that corporations seek recognition and issues involving accreditation. It is noted that a significant factor affecting the growth of corporate education is the growth of technology. Implications of expanding recognized corporate education are addressed, along with opportunities for research about corporate education. (SW)",

A wide diversity is noted among institutions in each classification and in different regions of the United States. Numerous graphs and tables supplement the narrative. In part two, the focus piece of the report, &quot;Higher Education Administrative Costs and Staffing,&quot; Galambos examines the place of administrative costs in the pattern of expenditures, analyzing elements of the rise in costs. National trends in administrative and support functions, including expenditure and staffing patterns,  are reviewed. Case studies of the State University System of Florida and the University of Georgia are given that consider teaching loads and functions of professional personnel. Higher education coordinating agency reports from the following states are included: Colorado, Idaho, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. One conclusion is that the escalation of non-teaching professionals in academe suggests a need for institutions to evaluate their staffing patterns to determine whether more efficient utilization of personnel is possible. Appendices include (1) administrative expenditures related to instruction, and (2) 1985 positions by category, state university system. Six figures and 24 tables are provided. (LB)",

        "description":"Following a summary and critique of the research on the use of computers in education to develop higher-order thinking skills, this paper advances eight hypotheses regarding the failure of research to confirm expected positive effects, and makes two major claims. The hypotheses are as follows: (1) a cognitive chain of consequences of programming instruction exists, and students are not progressing to the end of the chain; (2) applications represent a more likely area than programming for the desired cognitive outcomes; (3) research on cognitive outcomes of programming has been poorly conceptualized; (4) such research has been unsophisticated and done at the wrong age level; (5) the anticipation of cognitive benefits constitutes a resurrection of the discredited concept of mental  discipline; (6) problem-solving, higher-order thinking, and other goals of programming instruction are discontinuous with the regular curriculum; (7) problem-solving and higher-order thinking may be domain-specific; and (8) failure to find the desired effects of programming has been due to a lack of curricular sophistication, and objectives related to such outcomes have not been inherent in experimental treatments. The first major claim is that the principal weakness of research on the cognitive consequences of programming instruction very likely has been its inadequate consideration of curriculum issues. The second claim is that a relatively new declarative programming language, Prolog, which is radically different from procedural languages like BASIC and Logo, merits serious  consideration for educational use. A brief introduction to Prolog concludes the paper. A list of 44 references is included. (MES)",

A faculty member from each of the 19 departments in the College of Agriculture was asked to recommend two classes representative of the students in his or her department, and the survey was administered to this sample of 895 students. Results were analyzed by analysis of variance techniques to determine if there was a significant difference in literacy scores between students in the freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate classifications, and Duncan's multiple range test was used to separate the means. Scores were stratified to include those specifically related to computer hardware, software,  programming, agricultural computer use, miscellaneous technical questions, and computer experience with six specific software packages. Scores were also analyzed for differences due to the students' majors. Results indicated that, regardless of high school experience, freshman literacy scores were below those of seniors. It is concluded that the responsibility for computer literacy should be placed on the university, and several ways in which departments can work toward this goal are suggested. Statistical analyses are included, 12 references are listed, and the survey instrument is appended. (MES)",

The 20 intermediate and advanced psychology majors who volunteered to participate in the study were tested on the speed and accuracy of their recognition of 20 familiar melodies.

First, an interest inventory was administered to a sample of 301 elementary students (i.e., grades 1-5) in South Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania to determine their favorite television shows, books, and school subjects. \"The Cosby Show,\"\"ALF,\"\"Family Ties,\" and \"The A-Team\" were the most highly rated, and at least three samples of each of these shows were included in the second part of the study, which focused on the content of prime-time television programs. Mathematics was the favorite subject of 42% of the students, and 29% chose reading as their favorite. The study of prime-time television used a low-inference measure to record nine  specific behaviors exhibited by characters on a sample of 27 prime-time television shows: reading, holding reading matter, writing, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, shooting people, attacking people, killing people, and wrecking vehicles. Results showed significantly more instances of reading than acts of violence per hour, and there were less smoking, drinking, and violence in the shows the children liked best than in the total sample. A discussion of the implications of the findings of this study for parents and teachers concludes the report. Statistical analyses and a list of 19 references are included. (MES)",

        "description":"Videodiscs have much to offer in developing the school curriculum, but teachers must use definite criteria in planning teaching-learning situations that will enable students to achieve on an individual basis. Thus, students should find meaning, interest, purpose, provision for individual differences, and a balance among objectives in their learning activities. Diverse philosophies of education may be utilized in videodisc technology; i.e., realism, experimentalism, idealism, and existentialism may be stressed as philosophies of education to provide direction and guidance in teaching-learning situations. The psychology of learning also needs to be utilized to assist each student to achieve as much as possible. Thus a behavioristic approach and considerable student input in ongoing  lessons and units should be used to provide logical and psychological curricula, as well as inductive procedures to lead students to make relevant generalizations, and deductive teaching to assist them in moving from a generalization to its specifics.

        "description":"Designed to pilot a particular technique for eliciting imaginative constructions centered on the microcomputer, this exploratory study used a &quot;projective&quot; type method with a game format that required group performance. Students in a mixed class of 88 graduate students enrolled in a course on social thought were directed to generate multiple fantasy narratives around computer use. To do this, each student was given a sheet of paper with the first line of a story--&quot;Norman (or Jane) sat down at the computer&quot;--and instructed to write the next line of the story. The sheets were then folded in such a way that only the last sentence written was visible and passed down four seats to the left. As the students received the next sheet, they added another sentence and this procedure was  repeated until the completed stories averaged 6 to 7 lines in length. Analyses of the data to identify and illustrate qualitative themes and patterns in the stories found the predominant thematic dimension to be the hedonic continuum, from pleasure to pain, with a distinct bias in content toward the latter. A comparison of the results with Gregory Bateson's theories on man and high technology concludes the paper, and an extensive reference list is provided. (RP)",

The paper falls into three main parts. The first situates matters in terms of information-processing skill (IPS) psychology and comments on its recent application to thinking about teacher expertise. It is also noted that recent work on professional competence, as well as student-teacher construals, corroborates the IPS implication that the development of teaching expertise requires meaningful classroom practice. Presenting RAP as an unobtrusive means of guidance using miniaturized radio communication during ongoing teaching, the second part of the paper  distinguishes the technique from the concept and offers some principles and corresponding rules of thumb for &quot;rapping.&quot; The third part describes and presents some preliminary results of an 18-month research project designed to assess the efficacy of RAP for student teachers and ways of initiating supervisors into RAP usage.

Focused on the impact of library staffing on the ability of students and faculty to access and use information, findings are presented for the seven operation areas of collection development and management, organizing for use, access services, instructional services, reference and research, staff development, and collegial and administrative activities. It is concluded that current library staffing shortfalls seriously impair library access and use, and a 13% increase in staff system-wide is recommended, as well as an increase to 33% in  the proportion of total staff at the professional/management level.

In addition, a wide selection of concrete, semi-concrete, and abstract learning materials should be available to appeal to students' diverse learning styles. Not only should these materials meet the needs of the students, but librarians should also develop a personal philosophy of helping learners to achieve. Moreover, libraries should have facilities that benefit individuals optimally,  including a quiet environment for students using reading materials, a display area where students may discuss their observations with others, and conference rooms for committee work involving students. In addition, criteria for obtaining appropriate library materials should be established, and library materials and services should be continually evaluated.

A discussion of providers and consumers describes the provision of staff and career development opportunities by library schools, professional library and other organizations, library and information centers, the Oklahoma Department of Libraries (ODL), and the Oklahoma Network for Continuing Education. In addition, the major consumers of such programs are identified as library and information science professionals who possess an MLS (master of library science) or equivalent graduate degree, non-degreed librarians employed in professional capacities, and/or  library staff members. A discussion of program content indicates that the content and level of programs vary according to the provider's perception of the consumer's background, need, and location; and a description of program formats includes conferences, short courses, workshops, and talkback television offered by various providers. Finally, based on 16 specific findings, 6 primary and 18 additional recommendations for statewide program planning for continuing professional library and information science education are presented. It is concluded that, despite the commitment to continuing education in Oklahoma, both consumers and providers must be convinced that lifelong learning and education are as important as formal, initial education.

Meant to enlarge options and supplement available approaches, this alternative approach focuses on the translation of library experience and potential into human terms. Following a brief introduction, the project history is discussed, the sense-making approach is introduced, and an overview of 11 research modules for assessing accountability and need is provided. The modules themselves are then presented, and the results of  20 test applications of the modules by 19 libraries are discussed. Finally, a &quot;debriefing&quot; section presents general concerns and questions about the sense-making approach that were expressed by librarians involved in the module testing applications. The text is supplemented with nine tables as well as numerous illustrations and graphs. Eight appendices include a listing of 19 librarians who will serve as a consulting network; guidelines for questionnaire development, interviewing, sampling, content analysis, and data analysis; suggestions for interpreting results; and a 43-item annotated bibliography.

Potential benefits of DTP are described as: (1) increased availability of higher quality printed learning materials for classroom use; (2) quick and easy modifications; (3) lower cost of production; (4) more exciting printed materials; (5) increased emphasis on visual communication; and (6) increased sales of computer hardware and software. The potentially detrimental effects are identified as badly-designed materials, duplication of effort, and costs of purchasing and maintaining the  software/hardware. Both the current and the historical roles of educational technology in teaching are reviewed, and educators are urged to consider DTP in the context of past experiences with educational innovations.

Both groups performed searches using the system and then completed evaluation forms that inquired about academic background, previous computer experience, library experience, and user reactions to ERIC SP. Data obtained from the 73 users who completed the survey indicated that, while many users will need assistance with ERIC SP, the classes are not essential for the successful implementation of an ERIC SP service.

First, highlighted findings indicate that: (1) associate degrees and postsecondary certificates or diplomas increased more rapidly than all other awards granted in higher education institutions from 1975 to 1985, although their growth slowed after 1983; (2) associate degrees accounted for 75% of all less-than-4-year degrees; (3) over 75% of all awards were in four major fields of study, i.e., business and management, liberal/general studies, health sciences, and engineering  technologies; and (4) in 1985, women outearned men in less-than-4-year degrees by a margin of 60,600 awards. Following an overview of trends of the 1975 to 1985 decade, the report examines awards by major field of study and instructional program in the combined category of less-than-4-year awards. The report then turns to the categories of associate degrees, 1-but-less-than-4-year awards, and less-than-1-year awards. The next sections focus on state findings for academic year 1985, institutional findings, and the occupational outlook of top-ranking instructional programs. Appendixes comprising more than half the document explain the survey methodology and offer detailed data tables including information on awards by sex of student, field of study, level of award, type of institution, and  state or other area.

It is written at a level high school students, parents, and others can read and understand, placing more emphasis on information that would be needed by students prior to enrollment than on materials needed after enrollment has taken place. The guide is coded to correspond to two nationally respected interest inventories: the Holland Self-Directed Search and the Strong-Campbell Vocational Interest Inventory. The personality codes in Holland's classification (i.e.,  realistic, investigative, social, conventional, enterprising, and artistic) have been matched up with six curriculum choices. Similarly, completion of career interest inventories provide for an immediate match-up with the college catalog's \"Career Planning Information Section.\" For each curriculum offered at IVCC, the catalog provides career information on nature of the work, employment outlook, training and other qualifications needed, career leads, hiring institutions, and suggested high school subjects. Counselors have responded positively to the catalog. The \"Catalog and Career Decision Guide\" for 1987-88/1988-89 is provided. (AYC)",

        "description":"Increased national attention to the quality of education has resulted in a more critical examination of the community college transfer function. This concern for transfer has been precipitated by several factors: (1) the declining percentage of community college students who transfer; (2) the growth of the community services, vocational, and remedial curricula; (3) a perceived decline in the academic performance of community college transfer students at four-year institutions; and (4) research indicating that students starting their collegiate careers at two-year colleges have a smaller chance of attaining a baccalaureate than do freshmen at residential, four-year insitutions. There are, however, several barriers to an accurate assessment of the transfer function, including the  lack of norms relating to the transfer function, flawed counting procedures, lack of accurate data on the number of students transferring, and difficulty in interpreting data on the upper-division performance of community college students who do transfer. Community colleges are responding to these growing concerns with a renewed emphasis on mandatory basic skills assessment and counseling. In a recent study, over 60% of the colleges surveyed required academic advising for all students, for students taking more than a certain number of units, or for all new students. In addition, most of the colleges utilized placement or assessment testing as a means of directing students into classes for which they were academically prepared. The current reexamination of transfer education has resulted  in the increased acceptance of an enhanced community college role in serving academically talented students and in greater recognition of the need for assessment and tracking programs that identify transfer students and assist them toward their degree goals.

        "description":"Educational accountability is central to the reputation of the nation's community colleges. Some community colleges are adopting mastery learning, competency-based education, curriculum tracking, and/or minimum competency-testing as a means of remaining educationally accountable. Mastery learning programs, under which students are required to demonstrate competency in specified, cognitive, affective, and/or motor skills, can be used to document learning. Rather than basing grades on how well a student performs in relation to his/her classmates, instructors require students to demonstrate mastery of course subject matter on criterion-referenced tests. Competency-based education (CBE) programs have been drawn from the mastery learning philosophy. Besides requiring students to  achieve a mastery of sequentially ordered course materials, CBE requires students to demonstrate competence in performing skills or behaviors that are central to specific tasks, activities, or careers. The structure of the curriculum and the flow of students through it are important indications of the learning that accompanies degree or course completion. Several educators have called for degree programs that provide an ordered sequence of courses, rather than a smorgasbord of unrelated electives. A final area in which community colleges are working in order to improve educational accountability involves the identification and testing of minimum competencies, covering the areas of reading, writing, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and mathematical analysis.

        "description":"Now that the growth period for community colleges is over, and public funding has stabilized or decreased, many colleges are turning to alternative funding sources as a means of financing new projects and maintaining services. Among the funding approaches are the following: (1) grants development, which requires a library of material on funding agencies, a campus &quot;fundability profile,&quot; faculty involvement, and a grants office; (2) revenue diversification, which involves the college in commercial activities that are undertaken specifically to support educational programs and services, including contract education, catering food, retailing, and leasing facilities; (3) solicitation of corporate donations, which has become an increasingly important means of offsetting cutbacks in  local and state support; (4) establishment of alumni associations, which can be valuable sources of alternative funds while also aiding the colleges in developing political support, fostering positive public opinion, recruiting new students, and locating possible donors to the college; and (5) community college foundations, which provide a mechanism by which the college can expand or improve services beyond the means provided for by public funds.

        "description":"Criticisms have been raised about large scale community college involvement in developmental education. A number of these criticisms seem valid, while others clearly are not. Some of the most commonly voiced concerns include the following: (1) &quot;The community college is the wrong place to provide developmental education&quot;; (2) &quot;Developmental education costs too much&quot;; (3) &quot;Developmental education should be the responsibility of a separate instructional division, not the responsibility of instructors in the collegiate curricula&quot;; (4) &quot;Community college faculty members do not know how to teach literacy&quot;; (5) &quot;There is insufficient articulation between community colleges and secondary schools&quot;; and (6) &quot;Placement and diagnostic tests are not valid.&quot; Close examination of these  criticisms reveals a lack of understanding of the nature and goals of developmental programs. Remediation is not only the most practical response to declines in student literacy, but it is also at the very heart of an open-door college. Steps to be taken to maximize assistance to students and maintain the integrity of the institution include implementing developmental education throughout the curriculum; mandating counseling, tutoring, and other support services; integrating tutorial and learning laboratory activities with classroom instruction; requiring reading and writing assignments; and using entry and exit examinations.

The approach consists of a variety of interdependent activities, which can include the clarification of institutional mission, long-range planning, academic program planning, marketing and recruitment, retention, and career planning and placement. A major factor underscoring the need for enrollment management is the decline in the numbers of traditional college-aged students--by 1994, it is forecast that there will be a 26% drop in higer education enrollments nationally, with some regions dropping by 43%. Suggested methods of implementing enrollment management vary. Some recommend that enrollment management emanate from the Board of Regents, which  should: focus the mission statements of each segment of postsecondary education by stipulating what it can and cannot do; tighten admissions standards; and establish strong mandatory transferability of credits. Some colleges are attempting to exercise greater control over the destiny of their institutions by implementing strategic planning with short- and long-range marketing plans. Enrollment management is an attempt by institutions of higher education to control the size of enrollments through a better understanding of the factors that influence enrollment patterns, and the establishment of structures and procedures to contact more potential students and influence their decisions concerning college choice and attendance.

Students attending 29 community colleges completed questionnaires and the New Jersey Basic Skills Competency Tests (NJBSCT) at the beginning and end of the fall 1986 semester. The 7,500 English writing students in the sample were primarily young, full-time day students planning to transfer to a four-year college. Study findings included the following: (1) at the end of the semester, students had  accomplished more course objectives than they had originally intended; (2) 67% of the sample successfully completed the writing course, 82% re-enrolled the following semester, and 68% of those intending to enroll in another English class the following semester did so; (3) the greatest rate of skills growth was shown on the essay test, with students at all levels exiting the course with higher average scores than they demonstrated at the beginning of the course; (4) the average post-test score of students completing the course one level below freshman composition demonstrated that those students were prepared for entry into college-level English; and (5) students' self-assessment of their writing ability was better at the end of the semester than at the beginning. Appendices comprise  almost half of the document and include: (1) college tables; (2) description of the NJBSCT; (3) a questionnaire; (4) a list of participating colleges/contact persons; and (5) a description of sub-samples used for each analysis.

A questionnaire was sent to 12,319 identified MCCD alumni, requesting information on alumni characteristics, the opportunities and services the alumni would like the colleges to provide, and willingness to volunteer for various college support activities. Study findings, based on a 12.2% response rate, included the following: (1) the typical respondent was a white, married woman, 39 years of age, with 2.5 children; (2) 75% of the repondents indicated they would like to have a  continuing affiliation with the community college they attended; (3) 48.7% indicated that they had earned a degree, a diploma, and/or certificate from other institutions; (4) over 33% indicated a yearly income of over $25,000; (5) of those earning degrees from other institutions, 30.3% indicated they held more than one degree (i.e., 57.6%, bachelor's degrees; 21.6%, master's degrees; and 3.3%, higher level degrees; (6) 50.1% indicated that they would benefit from continuing education courses, 47.7% from receiving regular information about college programs and activities, 36.7% from eligibility for fitness courses, and 35.6% from access to library services; and (7) when asked about interest in volunteer activities, 13.9% expressed an interest in being an on-campus guest speaker or  instructor, 12.5% were interested in being a professional contact for students, and 10.5% expressed an interest in alumni committees.

        "description":"In July 1979, the countywide Adult Basic Education (ABE) Program at Rio Salado Community College (RSCC) was established to provide adult basic education services to Maricopa County (Arizona) residents. Between 1979 and 1987, enrollments rose from 729 students to more than 5,700 students. A major contributing factor to the on-going growth lies in the program's ability to address the diversity of multileveled, multicultural adult students in comfortable and familiar locations, such as shopping malls, churches, public schools, community-based agencies and centers, and county jails. Since its inception, the ABE program has offered 50 basic skills, 48 General Educational Development, and 33 English as a Second Language classes in 48 locations in 16 communities, as well as a variety of  referral services. Other special features of the program include: (1) its emphasis on staff development activities, such as an in-service workshop for instructors, a statewide ABE conference, and program communications; (2) the use of a volunteer support system for students and instructors; and (3) special demonstration projects, such as a computer-assisted adult literacy workshop. Although the ABE program has experienced much growth, there is a need to further explore available resources in the areas of creating partnerships, promoting workplace literacy, improving instructional design, and expanding outreach.

The videodisc courses, \"Core Concepts in Mathematics\" and \"Understanding Chemistry and Energy,\" were designed to accommodate students who needed extensive review as well as repetition of one particular segment. Responses to the programs varied. Three segments of \"Core Concepts in Mathematics\" were felt to have problems in presentation or in content, while \"Understanding Chemistry\" was well received by both students and instructors. The positive features of the programs included good graphics, ease of use, variety, non-threatening format, and coordinated use of different visuals,  while the lack of instructions about moving from screen to book and inadequacy of screen menu were seen as problems. Once teachers became familiar with the technology, they were able to assist students in paying attention to detail and following directions. Overall, videodisc hardware was felt to be a viable option to ABE classrooms. The concepts of multi-media and innovation allowed students to be challenged and stay involved with technology.

Verbal demands were minimized, and a &quot;real&quot; versus &quot;pretend&quot; response set was encouraged. Subjects were six preschool boys and six preschool girls. Because of the small sample size, results  are presented in terms of percentages of subjects who responded correctly to the questions. Trends in the data resembled findings of previous studies in that the children's responses to the different types of referents followed the same sequence. No sex differences were found. Gender understanding increased with the age of the subject. Subjects' justifications for their answers varied, with some subjects indicating understanding of &quot;true-constancy&quot; and others offering &quot;pseudo-constant&quot; justifications.

The survey consisted of a district overview and program questionnaires. A total of 1,225 districts completed the district overview; 1,681 program questionnaires were returned. Findings concern program operation, class  size and ratios, teacher qualifications, paraprofessionals, salaries and benefits, and parent involvement. There were more special education programs than any other kind of program, and more were enrolled in Head Start programs than in any others.

Aspects of performance investigated were subjects' actual performance on the problem, their awareness of their problem-solving activities, their ability to modify their actions in order to adapt to new problems, and the effects of various training procedures on their performance and awareness. Findings suggested that performance can be markedly improved through a variety of  training procedures. Performance on the three-disc problem improved as a result of subjects' repeated practice, observation of the completion of the problem, and viewing of a videotape of a prior performance. Distinctions between the three training conditions could be seen in the way the children described their actions and in the way they were able to modify their activities to deal with complicated problems.

The sample consisted of 50 mothers, fathers, and children of predominantly upper-middle class social status, and included a high proportion of children who had not been classified as having a secure attachment with mother in infancy. Children's representations were assessed with a modification of Hansburg's (1972) separation anxiety test, which elicits children's verbal responses to pictorial representations of separation experiences. As each picture is presented, the child is asked what the pictured child might feel and do in response to  the separation. Results led to the production of a revised and completed version of the Sixth-Year Separation Anxiety classification system. Classification categories include secure-resourceful (Group B), insecure-inactive (Group A), insecure-ambivalent (Group C), and insecure-fearful/disorganized-disoriented (Group D). A significant relationship between Sixth-Year classifications and infant attachment to mother was found, demonstrating the continuity of attachment patterns over the 5-year period. No significant relationship was found between classifications and infant attachment to father. Characteristics of children assigned to the four categories of the classification system are described.

Such classes, which can be said to have a &quot;learning orientation,&quot; can be differentiated from classes where an emphasis on performance or doing work increases the likelihood of rote or short-term learning. Four elementary grade classes were selected for observations on the basis of teacher statements emphasizing thinking and the challenge of learning. Three of the classes showed clear evidence of learning orientation; the fourth showed evidence of a working orientation as well. A theme analysis of the class observations revealed that teachers in all four classes accepted individual differences; held positive expectations; and used encouragement and  preventive management. Teachers in classes with a clear learning orientation also emphasized a learning purpose, peer helping, self-evaluation, supportiveness, and probing of errors.

Teacher displays of negative performance also played a significant role in these classes. (Author/PCB)",

The project produced a Case Investigation Decision Support System with two sections: a manual version and an automated version. The manual version consists of a workbook that leads users through a standardized method for obtaining case information and making case decisions. Although the workbook was designed to prepare users for the automated version, it can also be used by itself. In a pilot test, the workbook gained broad acceptance. Part I of this document gives a full report on the evaluation of the workbook, and  discusses several problems which were identified by pilot testing of the automated version. Part II provides details on the evaluation of the automated version. Related materials, including questionnaires, model outlines, status reports, and design resources, are appended. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper presents a process-structural model of the planning of drawings in childhood, and reports on seven experiments investigating children's ability to plan their drawings in advance. Three constructs are basic to the model: a figural scheme or schema, a spatial mental model, and a working memory called &quot;M operator&quot; or &quot;central computing space&quot; that increases in capacity with age. A specially designed drawing task was used that enabled researchers to study quantitative relations between capacity of working memory and ability to plan in advance. In the experiments, children were required to (1) think of an interesting scene to draw, (2) verbally describe the drawings they intended to make, (3) point out positions on white paper where elements of the drawing would be placed,  and (4) draw. Subjects participated in either free or constrained versions of the task. In the constrained version, children were presented a list of items for inclusion in their drawings. Substantive findings were obtained in Experiments 3, 6, and 7. Involving 67 first graders and 90 fourth graders, experiment 3 provided a first test of the model and suggested a modification. Experiment 6, which dealt with 35 first graders, 45 third graders and 42 fifth graders, provided substantial support for the revised model. Experiment 7 provided additional control. It is concluded that the consideration of general information processing constraints on drawing skills is a promising approach.

From this perspective, it becomes possible to relate Pugh's (1977) conception of value-driven decision systems and his account of affective mechanisms to Cellerier's (1979a, 1979b) analysis of pragmatic and epistemic transformations. Tenuous as the resulting model may be, it gives a picture more complete than other models of the role affective evaluations play in adapting action and in constructing knowledge. In a preliminary way, the model also allows the  bringing together of empirical data on problem solving, on decision making, and on the evolution of scientific thought. Further study is needed to determine whether these beginnings can mature into a full-blown theory in which other aspects of affectivity will be included. (RH)",

It begins by asserting that the focus of kindergarten instruction should be on the total development of the child: socioemotional, physical, and intellectual. The need for concrete learning experiences, rather than the use of materials such as workbooks and ditto sheets, is stressed. Play is emphasized as an ideal means of instruction for kindergarten children because it is active and involves the senses. The paper asserts that it is important for children to choose their own activities, and for teachers to limit teacher-directed activities. It then examines the importance of language and literacy development in kindergarten.  Guidelines are provided for assessing children's development. Suggestions for fostering children's self-control and autonomy are presented. Finally, the need for teachers to determine developmentally appropriate ways to help children acquire essential learning skills is stressed. (PCB)",

        "description":"A study was made to follow up on questions about the conception of preconventional moral reasoning in Kohlberg's cognitive development theory. Based on earlier findings, the following hypotheses were formulated: (1) children will express genuine fairness and interpersonal concerns at the level of preconventional moral reasoning; (2) while children's moral reasoning at stage 1 may be characterized by unilateral respect for rules or unquestioned rule obedience, a punishment orientation will not be a predominant concern; and (3) moral reasoning at stage 2 cannot be explained exclusively by the model of instrumental exchange; children's arguments will show genuine concern for the welfare of others and an acceptance of moral rules which have the purpose of protecting the psychological  well-being of others. Participants were 65 urban Icelandic children aged 7, 9, and 12 years, who were presented with a modification of Kohlberg's classical Judy dilemma. Findings supported the contention that genuine interpersonal and fairness concerns are present at the preconventional level; refuted the assumption of a punishment orientation in the young child; and supported the idea of an unquestioned respect for rules. It is concluded that the findings present a serious challenge to the basic theoretical assumptions underlying Kohlberg's theory of moral development. (RH)",

To manipulate the information-processing demands of the task, the presentation rate was varied among children. It was found that at the slowest rate, toddlers discriminated changes in specific component frequencies only, while at the fastest rate they discriminated changes in the general melodic contour only. At intermediate rates, they were sensitive to relational information and discriminated interval as well as contour changes. Preschoolers showed similar performance changes with increasing rates, but  were sensitive to interval and contour information at even the slowest rate. Results indicate that children of all ages tested can encode specific as well as general pattern features when presented with sound sequences, and suggest that pattern discrimination performance at a given age reflects an interaction of the information-processing abilities of the listener and the demands of the task.

Also investigated were differences in beliefs of mothers in two types of families: the first characterized by interdependent social structures where the actors are closely linked by emotional ties, the second by individualistic social structures where social relations are more instrumental. Findings indicated that preschool teachers expected children to master basic developmental skills at an earlier age than did mothers. Teachers more strongly valued the development of independent and cooperative behavior, and placed less importance on obedience. Teachers also reported employing more flexible and nonauthoritarian discipline strategies than did mothers. The two types of caregivers did not differ  on the extent to which they attributed the success of their discipline strategies to their own actions rather than to external factors. In contrast to mothers in independent families, mothers in interdependent families were more likely to believe in later mastery of basic developmental skills and to make external attributions. These findings suggest that Mexican children experience incongruous social norms as they move between home and school, and that these norms, at least within the home, are associated with the social structural features of the setting.

Although the Assertive Discipline training program has been presented to over 400,000 educators throughout the United States since its introduction, only 11 research projects have examined it. The single study in which there was experimental manipulation of classroom control methods to determine positive and negative effects of the program found a classwide reduction of two  problematic student behaviors: out-of-seat behavior and inappropriate talking among third-grade students. Other research based on surveys shows a positive relationship between the program and (1) reduction in time devoted to discipline referrals; (2) improvement in classroom discipline and student behavior; and (3) improvement of teachers' and students' self-concept. A second empirical study conducted in 36 Oregon third-grade classrooms observed that classrooms using Assertive Discipline exhibited lower levels of off-task behavior than did classrooms not using the program.

Of this original sample 237 mothers were interviewed during their child's kindergarten year. Three years after kindergarten 212 mothers were reinterviewed. Teacher ratings of the child's school behavior were collected each year the child was in school. Results suggest that the child's  environment, as measured by parent characteristics, is relatively stable from infancy through the early school years.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to operationally define four components of a mental set and describe how students can be taught to be aware of and control their mental set. Parameters of mental set include affect, attitude, focus, and meaning. It is argued that many factors essential to the success of a given task are at least partially, and perhaps greatly, controlled by the affective tone of an individual; the individual's attitudes; the extent to which the individual is goal-directed; and the situational meaning the individual generates. These elements constitute the &quot;context&quot; in which individuals operate from moment to moment. Certain dispositions relative to these parameters &quot;set up&quot; success; others &quot;set up&quot; failure. It is further argued that one of the primary reasons for the  breakdown of many classroom learning experiences is poor contextual thinking by students, and perhaps by teachers. While good contextual thinking will not insure knowledge acquisition, its absence will defeat most presentations of content area knowledge. The proposed strategy for contextual thinking, which is meant to be taught and reinforced in the classroom, attempts to make students aware of the four elements of an individual's context, and provide them with a technique for monitoring and controlling the elements in various situations.

The target population included children who were eligible to enter kindergarten the following year, who were at high risk of not being sufficiently ready for the regular school program, and who had not been identified as eligible for special education services. The purpose of this evaluation of the 1986-87 program was to provide information to decision makers at the state level that would assist them in making judgments about the extent to which the intended goals for early childhood development in the public schools had been attained, and about potential modifications needed in the operation and administration of the program. The report presents  data in four areas: (1) the strengths and weaknesses of the early childhood programs, (2) the characteristics of the early childhood programs, (3) the perceptions of program staff concerning the operation and impact of the early childhood programs, and (4) instructional methodologies that were being used in the programs and the extent to which these reflected the developmental philosophy inherent in early childhood education. Conclusions and recommendations are included. Two appendices include early childhood program legislation and evaluation instruments, respectively. (PCB)",

A total of 72 children aged 18 (N=36) and 24 (N=36) months were observed in pairs in free play and problem-solving settings, as well as in different social contexts--same-age versus mixed-age pairing. Both mothers and an adult female experimenter were present with the children. Mothers also completed the Attachment Q-Sort and the Toddler Temperament Scale. Results indicate that by l8 months of age children engage in explicit, goal-specific help-seeking when confronted with a challenging problem. Girls sought more help on the toys that presented motoric challenges, while boys sought more help on the toys that presented conceptual  challenges. Rate of help-seeking increased in problem-solving contexts relative to free play contexts for both ages; however, l8-month-olds relied on gestures, whereas 24-month-olds were able to verbally communicate their needs. There were no differences in help-seeking behavior when social context was changed, and few relations emerged between help-seeking and temperament. (PCB)",

Findings indicated that fluency scores were greater for demonstrated responses than for verbalized responses. The correlation between verbal fluency and demonstrated fluency was negative, and the total fluency score was highly correlated with the demonstrated fluency component. Findings on verbal and demonstrative divergent thinking components of the study were compared to the results of a previous study which used a standard multiple-use task procedure with kindergarten children. It is concluded that tentative findings support the claim that preschool children are not as verbally  sophisticated as older children. Therefore, their divergent thinking ability can be more accurately assessed when a demonstration component is included in the experimental task. (Author/RH)",

For each hypothetical problem, subjects were asked to indicate whom they would select for advice: a familiar adult, an expert adult, a familiar peer, or an expert peer. Analyses were conducted for three sets of dependent measures, including first choice of consultant, dimensions revealed by combination of first and second choices, and justifications for choices. Findings indicated that preferences for a consultant were a function of both an age by situation interaction and an  age by sex interaction. The dimension of familiarity increased developmentally, indicating that although seeking help from peers increases with age, adults remain important sources of support throughout adolescence. In choosing consultants, females valued familiarity whereas males valued expertise. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Intensive observation of the helping interactions of 40 children in the third through fifth grades of five Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area schools was conducted for the purpose of assessing the impact of familiarity on the success of children's help-seeking from peers. The amount of visual regard that children received from peers was also assessed. Three types of students were selected for participation: 15 students from resource rooms, 15 students mainstreamed from self-contained classrooms, and 10 students who spent all of their instructional time in the mainstream. Students from resource rooms differed from those from self-contained classrooms in the extent to which they were exposed to regular students in instructional settings. Findings suggested that the relative lack of  help-seeking success experienced by the self-contained classroom students was due to a tendency on the part of those students to make fewer requests than their classmates, and to have even fewer of their requests accepted by other students in the mainstream classroom. The familiarity of students from self-contained classrooms and resource rooms to their classmates covaried positively with others' acceptance of their help-seeking requests. Students in the regular classroom directed more of their visual regard to students from resource rooms than to students from self-contained classrooms. The more visual regard children received from classmates, the more likely they were to have their helping requests accepted. (Author/RH)",

Presenting five arguments against such a mutually exclusive dichotomy, this paper concludes that although empirical and normative study can and must be differentiated, they should not be conducted independently of each other. At the very least, psychologists must consider normative evaluation of rationality in order to meaningfully investigate human reasoning and its development, and philosophers must consider empirical research on human reasoning if their conclusions about rationality are to have any relevance to specifically human rationality. Even  better, it may be useful to conceive the study of reasoning and rationality as a single, transdisciplinary endeavor in which empirical and normative considerations, though conceptually distinct, are inextricably intertwined.

The potential impact of teachers' nonsexist language, and encouragement of interaction among mainstreamed peers, were also examined. Use of an ethnographic case study approach revealed increasing acceptance of mainstreamed children by peers, as well as several patterns of gender-segregated play. Interaction data showed gender to be used more than race and ethnicity in playmate choices at both centers. More cross-gender friendships were observed at the center with a gender balanced staff. The most gender-segregated play at both  centers was seen on the playground and during other gross motor play, followed in frequency by free choice times. During such times, girls were observed attempting to join boys in their play. Implications for early childhood programs and teachers are discussed, along with implications for early childhood programs and the role of techers in promoting children's acceptance of diversity.

It was hypothesized that variables related to mother's satisfaction would be more predictive of child's outcomes than the marker variable of employment status. Results indicated that early maternal employment status during the child's infancy and preschool years predicted achievement in grades 1 and 2, but maternal employment at any time during the child's life did not relate to achievement in early adolescence. The process marked by the maternal employment variable appeared to relate to amount of time spent out of the home. Mothers who worked more during these early years had children with lower grade point averages in the first two grades. As expected,  satisfaction variables predicted more of the child achievement outcomes than employment history. Mothers who were less involved in household work and more involved in child care had children with higher IQ scores and self-rated scholastic competence in sixth grade. In addition, mothers who were satisfied with child care arrangements had children with higher grade point averages and self-rated scholastic competence in grade 6. Finally, mothers' experience of low role difficulty was related to their report of fewer problem behaviors in their children. (Author/RH)",

In the first study, preschoolers and second graders participated in a sex constancy task in which different labels were used to refer to a picture of a boy or girl. The results showed that older children scored higher on sex constancy than the preschoolers, but that children of both ages were more likely to respond correctly when proper names were used in the task than when pronouns or sex-neutral labels were used. In a second study, preschoolers, second graders, and fourth graders were asked whether a change in proper name would change a person's sex. The question was asked both with and without an accompanying change in the  appearance of pictured persons. The results showed that preschoolers and second graders thought that sex would be changed by a change in proper name but that fourth graders knew that both proper name changes and appearance changes were irrelevant to sexual identity. The results suggest that children attend to both language cues and information about appearance when determining the sex of another person. (Author/RH)",

Anger and an apparent lack of understanding of the child's transgression were the two variables most associated with  power-assertion. The second pattern of discipline reactions, induction-rejecting, were also strongly associated with objective situational characteristics.

        "description":"It was recently hypothesized that the source of interactional differences between mothers and fathers lies in differences in social perception processes, such as representation of infant and coding of situational variables. From this perspective, the present work analyzes the attribution of causality in interpersonal events related to an episode of interaction between an adult and an infant at play. Mothers, fathers, and male and female nonparents were asked to produce a story for six drawings representing an episode of adult-infant play interaction. An analysis of verbs showed that mothers used state (psychological) verbs in describing infants' behavior more than did fathers and nonparents. Moreover, a within-group comparison of descriptions of adult and infant behavior showed  different patterns of causality attribution. Mothers described a logically consequent pattern of causality, whereas fathers described a pattern of conjunction or joint action. Moreover, fathers tended to interpret fewer events in causal terms. Mothers attributed internal psychological states to babies and viewed adults as responding to such states in the play situation. Results show that, in general, the pattern of causality for nonmothers and nonfathers resembles that of mothers, although gender specific patterns were found for some aspects. (Author/RH)",

External assistance for design, and training of national personnel qualified neither as architects or engineers, was used to make up for the lack of a permanent unit for school design and construction, and a lack of knowledge of changing technologies. An historical perspective of primary education in the Maldives is presented, outlining the transition of the school from home-based, religious entities to the establishment of the Ministry of Education and finally to the government-run schools of today, whose policy is to expand educational facilities to all parts of the country by upgrading existing  traditional schools and/or building new ones, and to assist them in their functioning. Community schools, once completed under the Ministry of Education, are used by the community for seminars, meetings, parties and film shows, and by teachers for training. Designs for community school buildings and furniture plans are included and the structure of the government with relation to school construction and scheme of work is outlined. Seven tables, 25 illustrations and 3 annexes are included. (JMM)",

        "description":"Steps to alleviate the problems in achieving successful technical and cross-cultural training for United States Peace Corps volunteers are discussed. Historically, training was conducted at American universities or centers in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, or the Virgin Islands, but by the mid-1970s, in response to criticism that this provided inadequate preparation for the social conditions volunteers would find in their assigned communities, most of the training was being conducted in the host countries. Inadequacy of technical training meant volunteers were generalists, not specialists. However, it was felt that generalists could become experts given the proper training in self-reliance and self-determination with regard to individual service goals. Three current programs designed to  provide such training are: (1) David Leonard's trainers' orientation manual (stressing clear definition of goals, resources, and process of training, and describing the training program as an experiential learning experience); (2) James McCaffery's manual (designed to familiarize the student with basic concepts of development); and (3) the Peace Corps' Information and Exchange Division workshops (concerned with agricultural marketing in developing countries, and experiential learning). However, none of these programs describes how to identify local leaders and prepare them to take responsibility for community projects, and a useful guide to this process is Helen Strow's training manual (1974). A greater degree of consistency needs to be ensured amongst trainers, and efforts should be made  to match volunteers and assignments. Preservice training programs should be concerned with accumulation of experience rather than specific technical skill. (JMM)",

Social and health service agencies proved generally unable to assist by contacting their clients. Different techniques were found to be successful for recruiting and retaining members of the different ethnic groups. Newspaper advertisements and letters sent in response to obituary notices were the most successful in identifying Anglo widows. Mexican-American widows did not respond to impersonal advertisement or letters, but were located primarily through churches. Most Mexican-American widows agreed to be interviewed only after an initial personal visit from the bilingual, middle-aged interviewer.  Few eligible American Indian widows were identified, the population was also very small, and again the majority of referrals came from the churches. Significantly, it was found that no widows considered the interview process at all intrusive. Most expressed relief at being able to discuss their experiences and problems with a nonfamily member, the interviewer. (Author/JMM)",

        "description":"Because migration trends in the West and their consequences have sometimes served as indicators of what other regions can expect, it is important that such trends and effects be monitored and analyzed. This bulletin describes patterns of migration, assesses individual and family and social considerations in western migration, and discusses policy implications. Projective Markov modeling gives predictions of future population movements among the western states based on the assumption of stable transition percentages. Location preference studies focus on community aesthetic qualities and their associations with community size. Studies of actual migration behavior show that economic and family considerations influence migration and that migration is selective of the young, the more  highly educated, and those in higher paying occupations. Social consequences of western migration are addressed from cost-benefit and community satisfaction perspectives. Substantive mechanisms that can influence migration include incentives and inducements, regulation, information dissemination, expenditures and siting decisions, enabling actions, and coordination and organization. Thirty-four tables show migration data including western region and subregion migration by wage change, sex, age, and industry from 1960 to 1965 and from 1965 to 1970; reasons for migration; and key social costs/benefits of community growth and decline. Graphs show scale effect and migration effect curves for 11 western states. (NEC)",

        "description":"This module of the staff training series deals with techniques for developing career guidance programs in three settings--the home, the community, and the school. Suggestions and experiences are outlined to help practitioners gain skill in designing career guidance practices appropriate to these environments. Home-centered career guidance practices cited include family travel units, parent training nights, parent discussion groups, problem solving, and a career development parent series. Community-centered practices discussed are career fairs, professional exploration internships, community persons as classroom resources, and adopt-a-grandchild programs. Three categories of school-centered career guidance opportunities are presented with suggestions for each: group counseling  methods (teaming, role playing, orientation, gaming, and peer counseling), subject matter activities (stereotypes in the world of work, workers in the community, and &quot;I'm Different--Are You?&quot;), and nonsubject matter activities (career resource centers, &quot;Pow-Wows,&quot; career weeks, hobby time, and a mobile guidance van). Elements of an implementation outline are also considered: activity title, activity description, and career development goals and subgoals, behavioral objectives, time considerations, prerequisite learnings, teacher/counselor activities, student activities, resources, and evaluation.

Module contents are based on two handbooks: &quot;An Individualized Approach to Career Counseling and Placement&quot; and &quot;Career Counseling in the Rural School.&quot; An active dialog about the current status of counseling in rural schools is used to introduce the module. A general framework for accomplishing improved counseling services is presented before moving on to a detailed look at five major counseling services (individual inventory, counseling interview, information, coordination and referral, and follow-up). A case study is incorporated as an optional learning activity to highlight some of the issues discussed. Another suggested activity directs participants, working in small groups,  to identify ways in which a developmental career counseling program can be achieved. A brief summarization of key concepts concludes the module. Issues examined include major obstacles to effective counseling (large student-counselor ratio, lack of administrative and staff support, focus on remedial counseling, and lack of accurate information) and steps to assist counselors accomplish their mission (establish good working relationship with administration, identify needed improvements in current counseling program, improve time management, increase availability of counseling services, and orient and seek support of teachers).

The module begins with a brief introduction to placement in terms of definitions and the current status of placement in the participants' schools, addressing questions of who provides leadership for placement, what kinds of assistance students receive, and who is receiving placement assistance. Issues to consider when developing specific activities that assist students are discussed; these include student needs and available family, school, and community resources. Five major steps necessary to develop a placement program are outlined: locating placement opportunities, securing placement opportunities, developing placement  opportunities, maintaining placement opportunities, and evaluating placement programs. The following types of placement opportunities to be identified are presented: private employment, public employment, apprenticeship, military, education, volunteer, civic, and alternative. Ways in which to provide information to students through articles in local and school papers, bulletin boards, and guest speakers are described. Ways to develop student competence in completing application blanks, taking employment tests, money management, and interviewing skills and in preparing resumes through information packets, job-hunting clubs, seminars, and regular assistance are considered.

Presented among the strategies for accomplishing total staff development are field trips to work sites, memos, house organs, newsletters, cooperative peer observation to develop positive attitudes, workshops, seminars, professional meetings, interaction with community members, and continuing education. Workshops are emphasized as an inservice strategy. Brainstorming, case studies, demonstrations, group discussions, and &quot;in-basket&quot; techniques are suggested as appropriate workshop session learning activities. Key ideas presented include  the concepts that staff development is a support function, that staff development cuts across all phases of the program (planning, implementing, and evaluating), and that it should occur frequently (five to six times a year or more) if it is to be effective.

The difference between community relations (communication to promote awareness of school programs, needs, accomplishments, and problems) and community involvement (activities bringing community members/organizations into direct contact with students and school programs) are delineated. The benefits of school-community cooperation are outlined as: student  opportunities for community career exploration, experience in career decision making, awareness of community career placement opportunities, and exposure to a variety of community role models. Participants (lay groups and government and private agencies) are identified. Strategies suggested for improving community relations include news releases, radio/television announcements, newsletters, speeches, and posters. Strategies suggested for community involvement are advisory committees, tutorial programs, career information programs, student self-awareness programs, parent-child nights, school sponsored picnics, and job fairs.

By doing so, it sets the stage for examining ways to bring parents, employers, and school staff to an expanded world view, particularly as that view encourages wider career opportunities for youth. Training in developing such techniques will help counselors and educators to plan and implement programs of career guidance in rural and small schools and communities, resulting in broader career options for students. The module is based on the handbook &quot;Rural Community Perspectives toward Career Development.&quot; The concept of perception set (seeing things in a certain way based on one's experiences) is used to introduce this module. A discussion about  stereotypic thinking and the effects that it can have upon students' career development follows. Participants engage in brainstorming to identify potential strategies for changing stereotypic thinking and actively participate in the consensus-building exercise. (NEC)",

Evaluation is a process that occurs during planning and is used to monitor progress, and, later, to assess overall program impact. After a delineation of commonly held negative perceptions of evaluation, the definition of evaluation and the nature of the evaluation &quot;beast&quot; are discussed. With extensive audience participation, a matrix of the major evaluation elements to be considered in evaluating the planning phase of program development/implementation is developed. Using two handouts included in the module, participants are instructed to work in small groups to develop a similar matrix for  evaluating the planning of a staff development program. Evaluation concerns explored include issues such as: who are the users of evaluative information and what are their information needs; strategies for collecting and reporting that information; phases of programs (planning, tryout, implementation), and sample evaluation considerations for planning and implementation phases. Numerous evaluation instruments and references for others are provided. (NEC)",

On the 9-point  rating scale, the mean skill level of female respondents ranged from 4.36 for rock climbing to 7.00 for outdoor teaching. The mean skill levels for male respondents ranged from 4.98 for canoeing to 6.85 for backpacking. Of the 10 skills examined there were significant differences between males and females for only backpacking and rock climbing, where males rated themselves higher than did females. This study should help demonstrate that highly competent leaders should be hired without regard to sex. (JHZ)",

The lessons are arranged in a progression from easier to harder and cover vocabulary, conversations, verbs, holidays, and stories. The first two chapters present basic vocabulary terms for numbers, body parts, clothing, animals, colors, musical instruments, weather, time, and talking about one's self--family members, places, pets, favorite foods, and hobbies. Chapter 3 presents topics of conversation and includes lessons that teach correct language for children to use with elders and other ways to convey respect in Hupa culture. Chapter 4 contains lessons on Hupa verbs, most of which contain stems, pronoun and tense markers,  and sometimes markers indicating types of motion or general adverbial concepts. In Chapter 5, the holidays section, metaphors in the Hupa language are applied to Anglo-American holidays. Names and greetings for each major holiday are created from Hupa verbs that describe key events or characters. The final section contains stories ranging from retellings of well-known traditional myths, such as &quot;The Sucker and the Eel,&quot; to personal experience narratives by Hupa teachers. The manual is illustrated throughout with line drawings, and numerous student worksheets are included. (JHZ)",

The first section is written to familiarize non-migrant funded personnel with MSRTS health and education records. The section includes definitions of terms, national goals for migrant education, and line-by-line explanations of information provided on MSRTS forms. The second section, on health, examines the relationship between health and academic achievement; points out migrant health risks; explains the use of the MSRTS record to insure continuity of health care; and encourages the development of a team concept, with parents, teachers, health care providers, and recruiters  each assuming responsibility for the migrant child's health care. An outline for a model health workshop is presented, and the health care delivery systems of five states are described. The education section (the third section) shows how the MSRTS record can facilitate effective instruction in reading, mathematics, oral language, writing, and early childhood and provides sample scope and sequence of skills, suggestions for instruction, and activities and materials that have been used successfully with migrant students. The appendix contains technical information, including health screening standards and information resources for health problems. (JHZ)",

Efforts to make traditional industries more competitive, improve support for homegrown businesses, and enhance the quality of the Region's educational facilities included testing a new steelmaking process, surveying over 1,500 new Pennsylvania businesses, and training adult literacy tutors. Typical of the 36 projects funded in distressed  counties were sewage system upgrades and water tank construction. Technical assistance activities included studies of regional economic competitiveness, effects of oil price changes on Appalachian coal demand, substituting coal for coke, and strategies for Appalachian educational institutions to diffuse technology. Sections of this report cover financial support and distribution of funding by project type and by state. State and regional maps, county population change data, and a directory of local development districts are included. (NEC)",

The Hispanic civilian noninstitutional population increased by 4.3 million (or 30%) from 1980 to 1987. Educational attainment of Hispanics improved since 1982, but lags behind that of non-Hispanics. Hispanic men and women continue to earn less than non-Hispanics. Hispanic families continue to have less total money income than non-Hispanic families. The poverty rate of Spanish-origin families in 1986 was almost three times as high as that of non-Hispanic families. The poverty rate for Hispanic families has not changed  significantly between 1981 and 1986, but because of population growth, the number of Hispanic families below the poverty level in 1986 was 24% higher than that in 1981. This report provides brief explanations and specific numbers regarding population change and composition, educational attainment, type of family, unemployment rates, median earnings of persons, income of families, and poverty. The eight data tables include social and economic characteristics by type of Hispanic origin. Technical notes discuss estimating procedures and reliability of the estimates. (JHZ)",

Interested school administrators should consider initial equipment costs, annual subscription or programming fees, and maintenance/warranty contracts, and should contact others who have had success with distance learning, as well as their own state office of education. State-sponsored educational telecommunications networks are in operation or are being developed in Alaska, Kentucky, and Missouri. While this method of instructional delivery is not a rationale for replacing teachers, it is expected to increase in terms of use and acceptance.

The basic population eligible for IHS services consists of &quot;persons of Indian descent belonging to the Indian community served by the local facilities and program.&quot; Eligible Indians may receive IHS services regardless of their ability to pay. IHS estimates its service population by enumerating American Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts living within the geographic boundaries of its service areas, and adjusting those numbers for subsequent years by applying birth and death statistics. The report was requested by the House Subcommittee on Indian Affairs and the House Committee on Interior and Insular  Affairs. Principal issues identified by the requesting committee were: the health status of the subject group, services provided in view of their health needs, health delivery systems, and the growing problem financing the high-cost care that IHS facilities cannot provide. Findings and conclusions are summarized, and options on major issues outlined. Information on the Indian population and Federal-Indian relationships is provided. Later chapters trace changing health problems and status, regional health differences and particular concerns among Indians, and describe sources of Indian health care emphasizing IHS programs.

        "description":"Founded in 1969, the Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) is a nationwide computerized information network which records, maintains, and rapidly transfers educational and health information on more than 750,000 identified migrant children in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Based in Little Rock, Arkansas, the federally funded system operates under a contract between the United States Department of Education and the Arkansas Department of Education. When a child moves, his/her records are forwarded to the enrolling school after MSRTS receives notification, allowing the new school to concentrate on serving, rather than identifying, the child's needs. The MSRTS has been implemented in approximately 30% of public schools (about 25,500 schools). The  program's success can be attributed to effective training by MSRTS personnel at regional workshops, local site training, stream conferences, national conferences, or MSRTS quarterly workshops. The training curriculum during these sessions may include the MSRTS Health Record, the MSRTS Education Record, the Data Entry Specialists Operation Manual, and training in computer and program operation. Additional information about the MSRTS may be obtained from local school district migrant program offices, state migrant education programs, or by writing to the Migrant Student Record Transfer System, Arch Ford Education Building, Little Rock, Arkansas 72201.

Next, the purpose of the organization and services to be provided by the organization must be determined. Services may include workshops, newsletters, resources, and/or certification programs. A list of immediate and long-term goals should be compiled and prioritized. Officers for the first year of operation need to be determined and selected. Essential committees must be identified and named. Significant committees during the early years of the organization might include membership,  constitution and bylaws, finance, newsletter, workshop, resource services, goals, and nominating. Finally, the constitution and bylaws should be written, including names, purpose, logo, membership, dues, meeting schedules, makeup of the executive board, officers, committees, and their lengths of terms and responsibilities.

They should learn what the community represents, the services that a community offers, and how their lives can be improved by making use of those services. Migrant students should have the opportunity for involvement in extracurricular activities so that they might develop special talents and social skills. By adding these components to the basic educational plan, migrant children will gain a better understanding of how education can lead to an improved way of life. Educators who help migrant children adjust to new surroundings will want basic knowledge of children with limited English proficiency as well as information about how migrant children relate to their teachers. As a  result of federal and state legislation, many local services are now available to migrants, including a variety of educational programs, health services, and welfare services. Migrant children's understanding of their communities can be dramatically increased by direct contact with community resources and programs by way of field trips and community-focused career education programs. Extracurricular programs for migrant children should consider issues such as transportation and informing parents of available programs. The bibliography cites 10 references, 9 available from ERIC.

        "description":"There are no quick and easy tips to motivating American Indian students into graduate education. The decision to make a commitment of time and money to graduate training, particularly at the doctoral level, and the ability to succeed in such a program, is affected by a number of factors: (1) parental and peer encouragement; (2) awareness of career options; (3) role models; (4) adequate academic preparation at the high school and undergraduate level; and (5) adequate financial and academic support services at the graduate level. No one factor can be identified as most important. Any attempt to motivate students by addressing one of these factors must be undertaken with the awareness that all are related. Teachers and counselors must overcome the lack of effective family and peer  support systems for American Indian students at all levels of education. A basic fact is that American Indian adults often cannot motivate children because of their own low levels of education. Tribes can contribute to the process of motivation by providing scholarship support for college education, including graduate education. Most do so now. They should also see that their own community colleges or colleges in neighboring communities upgrade the educational opportunities of tribal members and make a commitment to encourage young people to become college teachers by promising jobs where possible. They might set up loan funds on the model of forgivable loans. For example, students who come back to the reservation to teach would be forgiven a certain part of the loan for each year of  service. Most of all, tribes have to see that the development of human resources, their most important asset, is necessary to long-range development plans. They must realize that tribal members can benefit the tribe by being able to teach their college-level skills to future generations. (JHZ)",

The first issue addressed is the education of children before they start to school, and the emphasis is on developing pride, self-confidence, and a desire to learn and do new things. Suggestions for parents include teaching American Indian culture by telling stories of American Indian traditions, by teaching American Indian songs and dances, and by explaining special tribal ceremonies. The parents of school-age children are encouraged to get to know the school itself and the people who are involved in teaching their children. A meeting with the principal is recommended as a way to find out about school rules, the  school bus system, meal plans, medical services, culture and language classes, and extracurricular activities. The format and content of parent-teacher conferences are described. Advice for parents includes making a list of questions to ask the teacher as well as telling the teacher something helpful about the child. The roles of Parent Advisory Councils and of school boards are outlined, and the importance of parent involvement in these organizations is stressed. (JHZ)",

        "description":"For Mexican American students, grade-level reading and overall academic achievement decline, as measured by standardized tests, as they progress through the educational system. By grade seven, 65% of Mexican American students fail one or more grade levels below expected achievement. To reverse this trend of academic failure, teachers need to use instructional strategies that are effective with Hispanic students. Junior high teachers will want to provide clear and concise sequential steps in assignments, devise a variety of activities using English language and reading skills, strive for effective English instruction, alert students to reading skills they possess, recognize students' varying language and reading skill levels, and provide individual instruction as needed. High  school teachers should become more proficient in teaching reading skills, provide students with appropriate labels for reading skills, and encourage students to apply collateral cognitive processes to all reading assignments. Fifteen references dealing with reading instruction and minority students are appended. (JHZ)",

        "description":"The 12 states comprising the North Central Region have been affected in similar ways by the farm crisis of the 1980s. Statewide surveys show sizeable proportions of farm operations that are experiencing moderately high levels of financial stress. The problems caused by chronic stress on family structure and functioning, the loss of mainstreet businesses, and bank closing are felt throughout the region. The Cooperative Extension Agencies in the states have approached the problems in similar ways. They have developed new programs with long- and short-term efforts, and they have adapted existing programs with short-term or temporary activities and long-term commitments. Extension has been most heavily involved in developing new, relatively short-term programs such as the use of  hotlines, crisis intervention teams, and bankrupcy or bank closing response teams. New, long-term programs include projects and research designed to achieve economic and agricultural diversification. The addition of resources to the existing farm management programs is a good example of an existing short-run program. Many existing, long-term Extension and research programs have been helpful in meeting immediate needs. This document provides 12 papers summarizing the farm crisis and programs designed to deal with it in each of the North Central states. Research needs are enumerated. (JHZ)",

Differences between Asian American students and parents and non-Asian students and parents were also examined. The report includes data on student math/science achievement, math study habits, educational and career plans, perceived aptitudes and abilities, extent and nature of parental influence, math-related attitudes, and demographic data on parents. Conclusions point up the similarities and differences between high-math females and each of the other two student  groups. Among the findings were: (1) parents' efforts can make a substantial difference in encouraging young women in math-related study and careers; (2) all students acknowledged a very low degree of influence from teachers and counselors; (3) high verbal/low math girls reported being least influenced by their parents; and (4) male students and their parents held more stereotyped attitudes concerning mathematics as a male domain.

Chapter one is an introduction to the material while chapters two and three examine recent reports and suggestions for change and discuss the place of mathematics in the elementary curriculum. Chapter four is devoted to an examination of the mathematical development likely to occur for the child in the elementary years. Chapters five and six consider the problems facing the teacher in trying to accommodate pupils at both ends of the ability range. Chapters seven and eight are concerned with the influence of modern technology on the mathematics taught in the elementary school, as seen by the use of the calculator and the microcomputer. Chapter nine is on problem  solving and investigative work. Chapters ten, eleven, and twelve focus on a number of matters connected with the organization of mathematics teaching in the school, consider how decisions are made about textbooks, and review various issues related to the assessment of mathematical progress. The appendix suggests some ways a local authority can provide resource support for an elementary school. (TW)",

It includes only Federal funding of R&amp;D programs, with R&amp;D facilities and all non-R&amp;D activities excluded. The sections of the report are presented in descending order of R&amp;D budget authority for the various functions in the fiscal year 1988 budget. (All the data in this report are based on budget authority dollars rather than obligations or outlays, since budget authority is the basis for congressional funding decisions.) Areas of R&amp;D addressed in the sections are: (1) national defense; (2) health; (3) space research and technology; (4) general science; (5) energy; (6) natural resources and environment; (7) transportation; (8) agriculture; (9) international  affairs; (10) education, training, employment, and social services; (11) veterans benefits; and (12) other functions. Each section provides an overview of the function and a summary table, followed by detailed tables and text describing the major R&amp;D program areas within the function. Over 500 R&amp;D programs are identified with their actual budget authority levels for fiscal year 1986, estimated levels for fiscal year 1987, and proposed funding levels for fiscal year 1988.

        "description":"To determine whether children's knowledge of arithmetic facts becomes increasingly \"automatic\" with age, 7-year-olds, 11-year-olds, and adults were given a number-matching task for which mental arithmetic should have been irrelevant. Specifically, students were required to verify the presence of a probe number in a previously presented pair (e.g., 5+1 followed by 5). Eleven-year-olds and adults were slower to reject a probe that was the sum of the initial pair (e.g., 5+1 and 6) than to reject a probe that was not the sum (e.g., 5+1 and 3). This finding indicates that, in older children and adults, obligatory activation of a sum interferes with a required response. No evidence for obligatory activation was found for 7-year-olds. These results tend to be consistent with current  models of arithmetic knowledge, and they suggest that one aspect of the development of arithmetic skill is the automatic retrieval of stored facts.

This paper outlines a consensus model of the novice physics problem solver that was identified at the conference. It describes a general perspective and a frame of reference about physics problem solving, and indicates some of the disagreements. The paper focuses primarily on the observation that novices often have multiple interpretations of physics concepts. Both theoretical and practical implications of this observation are  discussed. It is suggested that this framework be used to interpret many efforts to design effective physics instruction, particularly those concerned with problem solving performance and learning. (TW)",

It has also been demonstrated that possession of valid concepts of the nature of science do not necessarily result in better science teaching. This study examines the possibility that the language teachers use to communicate science content may provide the context (Realist or Instrumental orientations) in which students come to formulate a world view of science. Eighteen high school biology teachers and one randomly selected class from each of their sections (N=409) students were administered pre and post tests at the beginning and end of the fall term using the Nature of Scientific Knowledge Scale  (NSKS). Teachers' ordinary language in the presentation of subject matter was found to have significant impact on students' conceptions of the nature of science. These variables represented different contexts (Realist-Instrumental) teachers used to express themselves, scientific information and scientific concepts. (Author/TW)",

The program was designed to improve students' speed and accuracy in responding to addition facts both orally and in writing. A partner flashcard procedure was used along with the implementation of written speed tests. The results indicated that peer teaching significantly increased students' knowledge of mathematics facts both orally and on written speed tests. All of the students increased the percentage of addition facts,  as measured by pre and post tutoring tests.

When a possible model is found, an important next step is to evaluate the validity of the model. In this document, examples of subjects finding and evaluating mental models used as problem representations are discussed in several case studies which depict expert scientists solving problems. This paper focuses on a non-deductive strategy called \"bridging\" that is used to evaluate the validity of a mental model and that has been observed in solutions to both science and mathematics problems. In constructing a bridge, the subject creates an intermediate case that is seen as \"in between\" the proposed model and the problem situation because it shares  important features of both. A bridge can help the subject confirm or deny the validity of the analogy relation between the model and the problem. It is suggested that the bridging strategy observed in experts can be used to help students construct and refine new mental models. Numerous figures are provided. (Author/TW)",

This suggests that using a good analogy may allow students to overcome a deep misconception by helping them to change the conceptual model they use to think about a physical phenomenon. This pilot study presents evidence from a tutoring interview showing that the use of analogies can help in overcoming misconceptions. The main strategies employed to effect conceptual change (taken from strategies observed in expert protocols) were the use of analogies and specific techniques for confirming these  analogies. It is suggested that analysis of such tutoring interviews could lead to a cognitive model for how deep misconceptions may be changed during learning. Potential classroom applications are considered briefly. Several figures are provided. (TW)",

        "description":"This paper presents evidence to indicate that spontaneously generated analogies can play a significant role in the problem solving process of scientifically trained individuals. In addition, it is suggested that these individuals exhibit more than one method for generating analogies. Ten scientists (representing physics, mathematics, and computer science), were asked to solve a problem involving a spring and weight. Subjects were asked to verbalize their thought processes, which were audiotaped. An analysis of the results indicates that analogies can be generated by an associative process which triggers the new involvement of an old but separate idea, or they can be generated by a transformation process which modifies the current problem situation. Both generation processes are  considered to be creative acts, and may be important sources of creative power in scientific thinking. In contrast to the common view of analogous cases, this study indicates that the novelty of a number of the analogies generated by a transformation suggests that they are newly constructed cases, rather than cases recalled directly from memory. These findings may have significant educational implications for the learning of scientific models and the transfer of knowledge to new situations. Numerous figures are supplied. (TW)",

Particular attention is given to efforts in the biological and earth sciences, the subject areas in which much instruction in the scientific aspects of the environment is focused. The relative sparsity of research literature dealing with cognitive learning in the environment is noted. It is suggested that this is an indication that little cognitive instruction  in secondary schools takes place in field settings.

A number of the analogies were invalid in the sense that they led to an incorrect answer from the physicist's point of view. However, many were valid, and a few were powerful in the sense that they seemed not only to help the student solve the problem, but led to generalizations indicating that some conceptual change was taking place. Some of the effective analogies have also been observed in the solutions used by expert scientists and mathematicians. These findings support the position that many creative reasoning processes are ordinary thinking processes used with special purposes in mind, not unanalyzable acts of \"genius.\" This suggests that analogies  are an intuitive form of reasoning that could be tapped or taken advantage of in instruction to a greater extent than is currently done.

In this study, students in eight undergraduate classes were given problems in which the base-rate information was either causal or noncausal and either incongruent or congruent with the individuating information. In addition, 12 subjects were interviewed as they attempted to solve several versions of one of the problems. The results indicated: (1) strong individual differences in the perceived importance of base-rate information and even in how the probability estimation task itself was interpreted; and (2) greater use of base-rate information congruent with the  individuating information than of base-rate information which is incongruent. The interview data indicate that it is difficult to determine from the answer alone whether or not the subject thought that the base-rate information was relevant. These data also suggest that subjects have different strategies for dealing with probability estimation problems. (Author/TW)",

Two types of functions are distinguished: (1) &quot;purpose&quot; functions, that may affect whether students choose to think mathematically and (2) &quot;process&quot; functions that may support the component mental activities of mathematical thinking. Definitions and examples of computer software  are used throughout the document to illustrate the seven functions. (TW)",

During the final week of the encounter, 50 colleagues joined the workshop. The participants came from 20 different states and represented a cross-section of the best mathematics teachers throughout the nation. A major focus of the workshop was the development of instructional leadership. The potential for leadership weighed heavily in the selection process. The effects of the workshop will be assessed in a follow-up poll in September, 1988.

        "description":"The Middle Grades Mathematics Project (MGMP) has been an effort to produce exemplary mathematics curriculum units for grades six, seven, and eight, evaluate the compatibility of those units in classrooms, and to study the nature of the effort needed to help teachers to teach the units effectively in their classrooms. Each activity designed by MGMP is intended to be taught using an instructional model based on three phases: launching, exploring and summarizing. Teaching the MGMP materials places demands on the teacher relative to both the content and to the instructional model. This study examines the impact of coaching as a strategy in changing teachers' instructional emphasis on producing the desired instructional changes. Changes in teachers' beliefs and behaviors included  patterns of communication, teaching, planning for instruction and instructional thoughts and actions. Discussions include: (1) research questions; (2) theoretical framework; (3) methodology including development of instrument, observations, summer workshop, materials production and coaches; (4) the intervention; (5) results and discussions; and (6) conclusions and implications. Appendices include the study instruments and three case studies of teachers involved in the project: (1) a study of a lead coached teacher; (2) a study of a coached teacher; and (3) a study of an uncoached teacher. The study concludes that summer workshops were effective in assisting teachers with the MGMP units and that coaching is an effective strategy in promoting teacher change. (CW)",

There is considerable debate, however, as to whether these characteristics are specific to the field of expertise (physics) or exportable to other fields. While the question seems difficult to answer in general, at least three skills frequently observed in physics \"experts\" seem to have broad application to a variety of fields. However, the transfer to other fields may require a more deliberate and conscious awareness of the use of these skills than normally accompanies the acquisition of expertise in physics. This paper defines \"novice\" and expert and describes the strategies employed by each in a problem solving situation. The performance of experts  is described in detail including the choice of appropriate principles, the use of chains of analogies and the ability to transfer previous knowledge to areas of little experience.

In study one, learning style and math achievement data collected from an intact class of 23 seventh and eighth graders indicate that students' learning style preference changed after four months of CAI towards the accommodator type. Students with high math ability showed a higher pre to post learning style shift than the low ability students. In study two, learning style and math achievement data collected from a group of 22 19- to 21-year-old disadvantaged students involved in a five-week program of computer-assisted remediation showed a shift towards the accommodator type comparable to the results of study one. In study three, learning style and classroom  achievement of a group of 30 adult graduate education majors in a course that deals with utilizing microcomputers in education (Apple IIe) shifted after five weeks towards a preference for more concrete experience and more reflective observation. It is suggested that a change in student learning style preference, particularly for high ability students, occurs in CAI environments. A shift towards concrete experience and active experimentation may relate to higher math achievement in similar CAI environments. (TW)",

As a means for changing attitude toward science and science teaching, preservice science education and inservice science education have been recommended. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a yearlong inservice science workshop on the attitudes of elementary teachers toward science and science teaching. The Science Attitude Scale for In-Service Elementary Teacher II and the participants' written cognitive responses were used to measure attitude change. The study found that the workshop had a significant positive effect on the attitudes of the inservice elementary teachers. Also, it helped in reducing apprehension toward science and  improving the participants' attitudes toward using science equipment, doing scientific laboratory work, and discussing science topics. The appendix contains a workshop schedule, directions for developing a unit box activity approach to learning, lesson plan for science experiments/activities, and a listing of the cognitive responses of participants. The paper concludes with suggestions to determine the lasting effect of the workshop. (RT)",

Many feel that educators have the responsibility of designing energy education for children and adults so that they will become energy literate. This study investigated the impact of two summer energy education workshops on the participants and the impact of the local inservice workshops conducted by the participants on the peer teachers. The study examined the following questions: (1) what were the characteristics of the workshop Department of Energy (DOE) participants (N=50) and peer teachers (N=29); (2) what  effect did the workshops have on the participants; (3) what effect did the local inservice have on peer teachers; and (4) what were the similiarities and differences between the participants and their peer teachers? It was found that the participants included significantly more energy education topics in their school curriculum and used significantly more business or industry produced energy education materials and self-produced units than the peer teachers. The appendices include schedules of the energy workshops, demographic information about the participants, cover letters and survey instruments, and approaches utilized for incorporating energy education into the school curriculum.

Both the influence of different sentence constructions on comprehension, as well as the heuristics and misconceptions exhibited by subjects as they attempted to comprehend the sentences were investigated. The second experiment was designed primarily to determine whether it was possible to develop an intervention strategy that eliminated the use of erroneous strategies. In the first experiment, bilinguals took longer than monolinguals to comprehend sentences containing negations, although there were no interactions between sentence construction and language background that would suggest the use of  qualitatively different strategies by the two groups. The intervention procedure used in the second experiment was extremely effective for monolinguals and for most bilinguals, as measured by performance a week later. When subjects returned to be tested six months later, the improvement in performance was maintained for the monolinguals, but not the bilinguals. The educational implications of these findings are discussed. (Author)",

The review focuses on two facets of the curriculum: (1) the presentation of the concept of variable; and (2) word problems and the presentation of problem solving skills. With regard to the variable concept it was concluded that the review of the 41 textbooks revealed an astounding diversity in the approaches to presenting the concept of variable. Many approaches preclude other approaches, are contradictory, or are in some other way incompatible with each other. No book fully gets accross the idea of continuous variability without becoming pedantic and cumbersome. Furthermore, a majority of the texts are in some way ambiguous or confusing. Relative to the  second focus of the study, problem solving, textbooks need to include more word problems and thought problems that require more than a passive, algorithmic solution. Means for developing healthy problem solving habits in students should be explored and developed. (PK)",

These results are consistent with the view that introductory physics students often fail to actively transform problems into physically relevant representations, but function instead at a superficial level of understanding in which their attention is focused on the more perceptually obvious features of the problem.

The document evolved from research and workshop activity over a period of several years. It is designed for use by those with instructional or supervisory reponsibilities in elementary schools, grades K-5. It is divided into three distinct and quite different sections. The first section describes four competencies consistently demonstrated by effective mathematics teachers in these grade levels. Those competencies are: (1) knowledge of the content and structure of mathematics; (2) knowledge of cognitive/developmental theories; (3) knowledge of and ability to diagnose students' errors; and (4) knowledge of and ability to select  instructional strategies appropriate for reteaching mathematics skills and concepts. The second section is devoted to the diagnosis of specific errors frequently encountered in grades K-5. In addition, the development of strategies to effectively remediate these errors is included. The handbook concludes with an extensive primer on the concept of the training of trainers. (PK)",

The knowledge of DNA science is the basis for this burgeoning industry which may be a major force in human existence. Just as it is possible to move genetic material from one organism to another, scientists intend to transfer normal genes into somatic cells in order to correct severe genetic disorders. This procedure, called gene therapy, causes some critics to fear that human gene therapy might be used to alter fundamental human traits such as intelligence, personality, or physical appearance. Although scientists counter that it is unlikely that complex human traits can ever be altered by genetic means, the anxiety  continues to generate public controversy. This monograph endeavors to help gain public acceptance by providing clear and accurate information, including benefits and risks, about biotechnology by discussing the following topics: (1) definitions of biotechnology; (2) roots of the biological revolution; (3) tools and applications of biotechnology; (4) gene therapy; (5) agricultural and industrial applications; (6) biotech companies; and (7) regulating biotechnology and genetic engineering. Also included are a 14-page glossary of terms commonly used and a 68-item list of the literature cited. (RT)",

        "description":"The realization that the areas of second language and mathematics education share some common features and that educators in these fields may profit by an exposure to research and practice in both fields motivated the production of this paper. From an introduction to the literature, parallels in the history of the two disciplines were recognized: in mathematics, movements emphasizing problem-solving and critical thinking, and in second-language education, the reconceiving of language as a tool for communication and for the making of meaning. This paper focuses on several contributions from theory, research, and practice in second language instruction, showing their relevance to mathematics education. Most of the paper analyzes three methods developed to teach second languages:  (1) delayed oral production; (2) the silent way; and (3) counseling-learning/community language learning. The characteristics and principles of each method are discussed along with their implications for mathematics instruction. Also, an illustration of how the same pedagogical principles can be applied to the teaching of a mathematic topic is included. The discussion of this paper is presented in the form of a dialogue with the words of the mathematics educator appearing in Roman type and the second-language educator writing in italics. (RT)",

        "description":"Previous work has identified four areas of difficulty that students seem to have with the topic of similarity: (1) understanding the definition of similarity; (2) proportional reasoning; (3) dimensional growth relationships; and (4) correspondences in right triangle similarity. This paper reports the results of an investigation into high school students' understanding of similarity. A unit addressing three of these difficulties was constructed for use with the &quot;Geometric Supposer.&quot; Students were observed as they learned similarity with this unit and were given pretests and posttests on fractions, ratio and proportion, and similarity. From the observations and tests, clarification of these three difficulties will be sought. The resulting greater understanding of student  difficulties with similarity will be of use to practitioners and of interest to the mathematics education research community. The use of technology, specifically the &quot;Geometric Supposer,&quot; provides two benefits. First, it supports a pedagogy which seeks to attack directly the students' difficulties in understanding similarity. Second, the lab setting allows researchers as well as teachers to examine directly student thought processes in the classroom. (Author/PK)",

Although scientists and engineers represent only three percent of the national work force, they are considered by many to be a crucial element in the nation's efforts to improve its economic competitiveness and national security. As a result of this study, it was found that a decline in the college-age population in the next decade and an increase in the fraction of the 18 to 24-year-old cohort that will be drawn from minority populations could affect the supply of scientists and engineers. In general, there does not seem to be evidence for concern that demographic trends will lead to shortages. This memorandum contains the following:  (1) \"Executive Summary\"; (2) \"Overview and Findings\"; (3) \"Demographic Trends: Undergraduate and Graduate Education\"; (4) \"Demographic Trends and the Academic Market for Science and Engineering Ph.D.s\"; (5) \"The Industrial Market for Engineers\"; and (6) \"Demographics and Equality of Opportunity.\" Also two appendices are included. One discusses the education and utilization of biomedical research personnel. The second lists responses to a survey on factors affecting minority participation in science and engineering. (RT)",

        "description":"This report describes an investigation in England of some of the problems children experience with fractions. In particular, the restricted view that some children have of fractions is investigated. The methodology involved a large number of interviews with secondary school children (aged 12-14). The results of these interviews led to the design of teaching experiments which involved both small groups and whole classes with a pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest. Results of the study address student understanding of models of fractions, the division aspect of a fraction, fractions as numbers, and equivalent fractions as well as the teaching module that was developed. Implications for the teaching of fractions include: (1) the learning of fractions would be  facilitated if teachers developed their skills of listening to children and of encouraging them to talk about their interpretation of fractions and associated problems; (2) a greater emphasis could be placed on the division interpretation of fractions; (3) more attention needs to be given to the basic ideas of equivalence of fractions; (4) more attention needs to be given to the limitation of the \"part of a whole\" model of a fraction; and (5) more attention needs to be paid to the importance of the transition from the realm of counting numbers to that of rational numbers. Appendices include the interview and testing materials. (PK)",

        "description":"Many feel that an advantage to using computer simulations in science teaching is that they give students the opportunity to witness or perform experiments which might otherwise be too expensive, time consuming, or dangerous for them to do. Simulations attempt to mimic the kind of experience students get in a laboratory and help students learn new facts. It is held that simply providing students with laboratory experience does not help them to understand the ideas of scientists. This paper urges researchers, educators and software designers to consider how computer simulations can be used to bring about conceptual change and understanding. The purpose of this paper is to provide a rationale for designing conceptually enhanced simulations and describe their underlying structure.  Part one discusses natural phenomena and defines the problem. Part two discusses model systems and identifies the kinds that may play a role in helping students understand the theoretical frameworks of scientists. The third part shows how these ideas were applied in developing a simulation to teach the concepts of weight and density. Twenty-five references are listed. (CW)",

These surveys were designed to assess overall achievement in the pre-high school grades and to provide school, district and citywide summary information about student performance in basic areas of the science curriculum. Another purpose was to facilitate staff development in areas of greatest instructional need. The content areas included were biology, earth science, physics, chemistry, and process skills, plus geology, weather, and astronomy in grade eight. This document contains discussions of the process, administration, findings, reliability and validity of the test. Tables include: (1) percentages of students reaching mastery in general science;  (2) citywide results by subtest and total test in both general and special education; (3) summary of students tested citywide; and (4) mean p-value by district.

The report is based on data found in Bureau of Census publications. The median age of women in North Dakota has increased from 25.9 years in 1960 to 29 years in 1980. North Dakota women were slightly less likely to be married and more likely to be widowed or divorced. During this period, North Dakota women became more highly educated. By 1980, two-thirds of all North Dakota females, 25 years of age and over, had completed at least four years of high school, and about 13 percent had completed four or more years of college. The number of North Dakota women, aged 16 and over, in the labor force rose by 148 percent from 1950 to 1980, the largest percentage of whom were  employed in technical, sales, and administrative support occupations. The 1979 mean annual earnings of all working women in North Dakota were $5,772. Appendices include: (1) 19 tables; (2) 7 figures; and (3) an explanation of microdata. (SM)",

American Indian culture includes a spiritual heritage that integrates both a tribe and individuals with the universe. It emphasizes harmony with all aspects of life and provides a model for redefining the relationships between society and technology. This paper examines American Indian ideas about creation, relationships with all life forms, and harmony with natural forces in contrast to western beliefs of subject and object separation. American Indian concepts of oneness with the earth, which led to difficulties in understanding private land ownership, and ceremonies that portray the unity and awareness of all elements are highlighted. Western  civilization faces ecological, social, and technological problems because of a lack of awareness about how various interactions and techniques impact the entire universe. A study of American Indian beliefs can help people view technology from a connected or wholeness perspective, rather than from a position of efficiency, speed, or operational ease. (JHP)",

Candidate profiles are provided for: Bruce Babbitt, Michael Dukakis, Richard Gephardt, Albert Gore, Jr., Jesse Jackson, and Paul Simon (Democrats); and George Bush, Robert Dole, Pete DuPont, Alexander Haig, Jr., Jack Kemp, and Pat Robertson (Republicans). The issues include: (1) capital formation; (2) human resources; (3) international trade; and (4) science and technology. The presidential candidates defined the competitiveness issue as a series of interrelated concerns, each of which is sufficiently complex enough to require attention. The majority of the candidates have specific ideas and proposals for  addressing the components of the problem. Common themes emerging from the candidates positions were: (1) the macro-economic and structural nature of the competitiveness problem; (2) the need to reduce the federal budget deficit; (3) the primacy of human resource development; (4) finding ways to improve the export performance of U.S. industry; (5) the notions of accountability and productivity; and (6) the need for expanding the federal government's role in certain areas.

Changes in policy and administrative practices are required to improve educational decision-making within the federal government and to reduce inequities. Long-term strategies should include more thorough financial  analysis and policy development, while short-term strategies should involve: (1) hiring consultants to improve policy analysis; (2) selective training of Ministry of Education personnel; (3) reducing financial inequities between state and &quot;municipio&quot; schools by allocating a higher proportion of federal educational transfers to the municipios; and (4) reducing bureaucratic controls on federal transfers.

Procedural guarantees and the  extension of the protections to the states through Supreme Court interpretation of the 14th Amendment are outlined in essay five (S. Talarico and E. Fairchild). The sixth essay (T. Freyer) traces the development of black voting rights. Essay seven (C.

The first research method generally focuses on the teacher and identifies teacher behaviors (processes) that correlate with student outcome measures (products). Sociolinguistic research focuses on communicative interactions between the teacher and students and among students themselves. These research traditions are examined as lenses through which the classroom is viewed. Highlighting findings of several major research studies, a description is given of how each of these methods presents a different but complementary view of teaching in three areas: (1) teacher planning and decision making; (2) classroom management; and (3) academic  instruction. These research perspectives illustrate two important dimensions of knowledge that are crucial for developing a more complete understanding of teaching and learning processes. The first is of the general processes and behaviors that relate to student learning across a variety of situations. The second, of equal importance, is knowledge that explains how those processes operate and function within specific contexts across time. It is pointed out that both perspectives are important in understanding classroom phenomena and in developing programs to improve teaching. A list of 138 references is appended. (JD)",

It also gathered information on teachers' specific paperwork complaints and their suggested remedies. The 487 teachers who responded to the survey were sorted according to their answers in order to identify those who: (1) had problems with paperwork; (2) felt that the paperwork required of them was different from two years ago; and (3) cited specific problems. Teachers' responses indicated frustration at having to neglect their teaching because of increased paperwork requirements, and an  underlying sense that it was distrust that forced them to have to document so many transactions. Unnecessary or redundant paperwork was deplored. The state was believed to be the main source of increased paperwork requirements. Suggestions were made to reduce, simplify, or eliminate paperwork, and to assist teachers to cope with present requirements. (JD)",

The question of amateurism and professionalism is discussed, and a synopsis is presented of the two major revenue-producing college sports, football and basketball. The evolution of the academic image of the college student-athlete is reflected in the increasing emphasis upon the money-making potential of these sports for institutions of higher education. A sample is offered of the popular literature regarding these sports. This includes written works that may have no scientific foundations or underpinning and are often highly opinionated (e.g., newspapers, magazines, pamphlets,  brochures). A review of professional literature contains research studies and dissertations that are relevant to the study of the academic achievements of student-athletes. A brief analysis of the commercialization of college football discusses how this contributes, directly or indirectly, to the health of the larger social system. Over 200 references are included.

The responsibility of the schools in developing sound approaches to teaching children to think for themselves in creative ways is underscored by a discussion on instructional and curriculum improvement. A section of the monograph is devoted to means for evaluating critical thinking skills.  Recommendations are made for changes in educational policy and practice and the increasingly crucial role of the professional teacher is discussed.

The six types of decisions that provide the potential organizational context for testing are discussed: (1) admitting candidates to teacher preparation programs; (2) licensing teachers as sufficiently competent to teach; (3) certifying teachers; (4) selecting teachers for specific positions; (5) relicensing practicing teachers; and (6) granting promotions, rewards, or special status. The individual characteristics that may be  considered in each decision class are briefly summarized.

The specific purpose of the poll was to obtain opinions on how the respondents viewed their teacher education programs, how they felt about proposals of the Holmes Group, and what they saw as the most serious problem for which they were not prepared as a beginning teacher. The sample as a whole felt that their preparation was adequate in the areas of oral and written communication and in planning and selection of materials. Preparation was felt to be inadequate in the areas of dealing  with personal and social problems of students and in diagnosing student needs. Among the Holmes Group proposals the majority of the teachers felt that a four-year teacher education program was sufficient. In analyzing the survey results, comparisons are made between the attitudes of teachers and administrators, and between persons in different age groups, different teaching levels, and with different academic degrees.

        "description":"As the number of teacher education majors has decreased nationally over the last ten years, the declining number of non-white teacher education students has been even more acute. Today barely 10 percent of the teaching force is non-white and that representation continues to decline annually. This policy paper reviews the current status of minority teachers and teacher education candidates and addresses some of the chief reasons why non-white students are not majoring in education. The major explanation proposed here, and supported with copious data, is that non-white students have not enrolled in and graduated from college at rates proportionate to the size of their 18- to 24-year old cohorts since 1976. Also discussed is the discrepancy between the number of non-white education  majors who graduate but do not certify to teach. In addition to data on the changing demographics of students in the nation's schools, specific recommendations are presented to increase the quality and diversity of America's teaching force.

The current educational needs of elementary and secondary public school teachers were determined. Information was sought on teachers' experience, existing abilities, attitudes, programming, expressed needs, and perceived limitations on handicapped learners. Results from 242 teachers indicated that a majority have not been involved in Individualized Education Program planning, believe that an adapted physical education placement must be provided, and need assistance in motor behavior assessment. A majority of the teachers were \"neutral/mixed\" in their interest toward teaching  handicapped students. Also, teachers still base the exclusion of students on the nature of the individual's handicap, functional ability, and activity chosen. Results confirmed the belief that teaching professionals do not possess the competencies necessary to conduct physical education in the least restrictive environment. The survey instrument and response data are appended. (Author/JD)",

Three of the interviewees were novice teachers; three more experienced. The subjects taught in Arab villages, a religious vocational Jewish school, and in a Kibbutz. Several educational contexts which give rise to teacher dilemmas were identified. The transition context created dilemmas for novices, which were related to professional identity and abilities, group membership, interpersonal relationships, and teacher status. Another context of teacher dilemmas was found to be within the areas of teacher planning and curriculum. Ethical problems and issues caused dilemmas in the context of classroom management. The societal context giving rise  to dilemmas included moral and political issues and ideologies. Two major explanatory frames for teacher dilemmas were identified: the gap between ideology and reality, and the multiple obligations with which teachers are confronted. (JD)",

The \"reification of mind\" (the assumption that \"mind\" is an entity just as is body) is examined as a research trend that accepts knowledge as existing independent of the biographies, the intentions, and the activities of persons. Criticism is also leveled at the other trends which deny the emotional elements of learning and fail to consider the contexts of educating. It is pointed out that if strategies to facilitate comprehension and cognition are to be found, the meanings assigned to those strategies are likely to be interpreted through a framework developed in formal schools. If learning is to be improved, an examination is  in order of the taken-for-granted structure of schools and how the structure must be modified. (JD)",

Focus is on: (1) the validity of classroom research literature and the credibility of classroom researchers, centering on content, methodology, and audience; (2) the role of research in teacher professionalism and empowerment; and (3) teacher learning and change. Most classroom research is difficult to access, has limited applicability to teaching effectiveness, comes from often unexplained methodological bases, and is not always explicitly conceptualized. Classroom observation will only become useful when educational researchers increase the relevance of research to practice and develop theories unique to what they see, couched in a \"language of criticism\" that is acceptable to  teachers. Professional development will be hindered if classroom observation systems: (1) are imposed rather than negotiated; (2) address only administrative needs; (3) imply an unpleasant action with unrewarding consequences; (4) ignore moral and ethical issues of autonomy; (5) fail to consider the need for time for reflection during the school day; and (6) fail to support learning after appraisal. Appraisal processes should assist teachers in building their repertoires of observational studies. (SLD)",

The thesis was studied that valuation results from an active inquiring agent whose cognition rests on the extraction and abstraction of invariants. The mental processes of 35 randomly selected workers (mechanics) from Sweden, England, West Germany, Italy, and the United States were studied via Perspective Text Analysis (an ecologically oriented theory of information synthesis). Seven subjects were chosen from each country. Unrestricted verbal responses of the subjects to three open-ended questions concerning information  management and utilization were analyzed. The subjects' mental processes were measured in accordance with an axiological approach. The outcome of the valuation was formulated into sequential flowcharts. The results show great variations in the pattern of displayed valuations among the five cultures.

The formalism developed controls the processes of differentiation and integration underlying understanding. The starting point is a culturally agreed-upon expectancy or prescription that defines a particular form of understanding. Central to an investigation of how scientists model understanding is how they conceive symbols. The collective cognitive imperative in the scientific community states that symbols are abstract codes whose definitions are wholly arbitrary and, hence, can only be understood by those who have a common outlook. Scientists working with the development of computer technology, especially within the field of artificial intelligence, have repeatedly pointed out that they have  constructed models of understanding the natural language of significance for cognition-oriented research. Therefore, focus is on classical models. It appears that self-reference is an important constituent component in any model or theory of understanding. (TJH)",

Moreover, the model is surface-oriented and assumes that the cognitive relevance of an utterance is defined by the dynamics of the text production and not by artificial criteria. The model has been tested on responses to questionnaire items constructed by a multinational industry. The responses were produced by 35 randomly selected workers (mechanics) from England, Italy, Sweden, West Germany, and the United States; seven subjects were chosen from each country. The differences  were tested for the power of normal curve test of P(sub 1) equals P(sub 2) via arcsine transformation at a(sub 1) equals 0.05. By agent control of the question-response relationship, differences in coherence could be demonstrated.

Students scoring below the 25th national percentile on the CAT were administered the North Carolina Minimum Skills Diagnostic Tests (MSDT). Statewide scores for students in grades 3, 6, and 8 on the MSDT in 1987 are tabulated. Students who did not receive a score of 70 percent on the diagnostic tests were invited to attend the Basic Education Program Summer School, as were students in grades 1-4 and grades 6 and 8 who did not meet local promotion  standards. The lengths of the program courses ranged from 20 to 30 days. Post-program testing indicated achievement score gains for the various areas tested of from 2.7 to 12.3 percentage points. The program was also effective in increasing statewide promotion figures. Expenditure for the 1987 summer school program, which served 40,191 students, was approximately 10.8 million dollars.

        "description":"To date, the majority of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) systems for achievement and aptitude testing have been based on the dichotomous item response models. However, current research with polychotomous model-based CATs is yielding promising results. This study extends previous work on nominal response model-based CAT (NR CAT) and compares its ability estimation as well as its overall performance to graded response model-based CAT (GR CAT). A data set of 275 examinees was used, derived from five administrations of the College Board's Achievement Test in Mathematics, Level I, at the University of Texas, Austin. Results show that both CATs had high convergence rates despite using a small item pool and had average test lengths slightly below 16 items. The NR CAT's ability  estimates were highly correlated with and not significantly different from an external criterion and showed no systematic bias in estimating ability throughout the trait continuum. In contrast, the GR CAT had a tendency to underestimate high ability examinees, although its ability estimates were highly associated with the external criterion. Educational implications of the findings include the possibility of merging computer-aided instruction and diagnostic testing with CAT. Six tables and nine graphs are included. (Author/TJH)",

A slight majority (58%) of the programs interviewed applicants only once or twice. A surprisingly large number (41.5%) of the PA programs require three or more interviews. Some programs had highly structured interviews; other were much more loosely structured. Many preferred a somewhat structured interview with allowance made for spontaneous questions.

The subjects were 114 students from a baccalaureate nursing program in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Focus was on understanding two perspectives of how evaluations within a nursing education program might shape nurses' skill development and professional competence by directing effort to their professional work. The study analyzed the students' perceptions of evaluations and reported effort for each of four work dimensions: (1) technical; (2) psychosocial; (3) planning; and (4) collaboration. Data were gathered via a questionnaire on the subjects' perception of evaluation influence and validity and the nature of the instructor's  rating for each of the four work categories. A second stage included interviews that probed issues of interpretation or illuminated findings from the survey data with a sub-sample of volunteers. Results indicate that: (1) students perceiving relatively greater rewards or penalties from psychosocial work and/or perceiving relatively sound and important evaluations also report higher levels of effort toward psychosocial activities; (2) overall, direct and indirect effects of the organizational evaluation system can be seen for both perceived work importance and effort; and (3) effort was predicted by sanctions for activities, evaluation soundness, and activities' perceived importance.

Strong empirical evidence of the utility of the statistical test in a variety of settings is provided. The procedure was modified to correct for increased bias, and a new algorithm to determine the size of assessment sub-tests was used. The following two issues were addressed via a Monte Carlo simulation: (1) the ability to approximate the nominal level of significance via the observed level of significance; and (2) the power of the statistical test while undergoing the modifications. Results indicate that Stout's statistic and the procedure, which grew directly out of a meaningful conceptual definition of test dimensionality, avoids the issue of parametric model correctness, attracts  the support of asymptotic theory, has modest computational requirements, and receives support from Monte Carlo simulations.

A small hypothetical data set is employed to illustrate that canonical correlation analysis subsumes both univariate and multivariate parametric methods. Several real data sets are employed to illustrate other themes. Three common fallacious interpretation practices that may lead to incorrect conclusions are discussed; these fallacies affect the interpretation of function coefficients, interpretation of redundancy coefficients, and failure to partition using canonical commonality analysis. The use of the factor analytic method of rotation to simplify results is also discussed. It is suggested that canonical correlation analysis is a powerful analytic method that  frequently best honors the complex nature of the reality about which the researcher wishes to generalize.

This finding is not consistent with previous research in which confirmatory techniques were employed to analyze BSRI data. Results of second-order factor analysis were more supportive of the validity of the BSRI. Again, this finding is not consistent with previous BSRI research in which second-order methods were used.

The specific questions addressed in this essay are concerned with the following: (1) the basic measurement problems identified by Thorndike and Wood in the first two decades of this century; (2) the means by which these measurement problems appear within the context of educational testing according to Wood; (3) means by which these problems were  addressed by Wood in the 1920s; and (4) contemporary views of these problems. Principles of educational measurement (objectivity, defined zero and unit, definition of the function to be measured, consistency, within person variability, comparability, distinctness of power and achievement, equal exposure and practice, advantages of indirect measurement, test construction, test use, and measurement must not be confused with pedagogy) are tabulated according to specific problems and proposed solutions to each.

In this paper, the errors-in-variables problem is extended to include specification error. Least squares procedures provide a biased estimator of the slope of the true scores regression line. Further, the maximum likelihood estimates of the slope (which are consistent) exist only once some assumptions are made. Maximum likelihood estimates are given for the extended version of the errors-in-variables problem (i.e., when specification error is present) under the usual assumptions and under several new assumptions that are more appropriate for the social and  behavioral sciences than the previously used assumptions. A simulation study illustrates this process. The results of the study indicate that the maximum likelihood estimates (both under the old and new assumptions) far outperform the least squares procedures when several different criteria (such as bias and standard error) are used.

Common assessments of these processes are often limited to scoring the accuracy of the diagnoses, investigative procedures, or management decisions that a student selects or lists. The assumption is that if answers listed by a student are correct then the reasoning underlying those answers is also correct. The purpose of this study is to determine: whether this assumption is accurate, and the extent to which adding the students' reasoning processes into the scoring affects scores as compared to scores obtained solely based on the accuracy of the answers. Sixty-four second-year  medical students were administered a patient problem to evaluate, and 67 fourth-year medical students were administered a different patient problem. The results show that taking into account the student's reasoning processes affected the subjects' scores differently; it reduced several of the students' scores and affected the scores of second-year students more than those of fourth-year students. This scoring process was found to provide a more accurate assessment of students' performance. (TJH)",

Findings indicate that less data can be gathered without having any major impact on the decisions reached if one uses optimal weighting. Several fairly accurate models using various reduced sets of data were proposed. Although classroom observation data were not highly related to the other variables, there was evidence indicating that the decisions reached without such expensive-to-gather data would be highly similar to the decisions actually reached.

Courseware purchasers must base decisions upon either a vendor's presentation or some published evaluator rating. Unfortunately, these are almost certain to be biased by irrelevant factors such as color graphics or presentation speed. The Center for Interactive Technologies, Applications and Research (CITAR) Computer Courseware Evaluation Model (CCCEM) emphasizes the instructional components of such courseware, rather than the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; of the associated technology and provides descriptive information on more than 300 courseware components.  Additionally, over 200 item-level tallies are synthesized into scores that may be used to compare similar packages on their instruction, management, physical, and presentational aspects. A study of the model's consistency found, on average, that seven of eight evaluators tend to agree on items and scores and that reliabilities for key scores are near 0.70. A comparison of traditional perceptual evaluations for the same courseware produced reliabilities averaging over 0.40 less than the CCCEM model, and agreements averaging 0.20 less. The results of this study suggest that the CCCEM fills the need of courseware purchasers for an objective, generic measure. Fifteen tables are included, and the distribution of CITAR scores attained by current CBT packages and item content of scales and  sub-scales are appended. (Author/TJH)",

In general, the responsibility for evaluation misuse is with the user, while the responsibility for misevaluation is with the evaluator. A distinction is also needed between intentional and unintentional misuse. Misuse of evaluation may be further defined as misuse of commissioning the evaluation, misuse of the evaluation process, and misuse of the findings. A more precise definition will refine the nature of misutilization in order to estimate how often it occurs. (SLD)",

Tenets of a unified theory of problem solving are discussed, concerning what the solver brings to the problem-solving experience, what the solver does in order to solve the problem, and the problem itself. This theory is considered along the lines of problem solving methods used in the biological sciences. The successful problem solver creates an internal &quot;problem space,&quot; a qualitative representation and redescription of the problem. Successful problem solvers break problems into parts and apply relevant procedures and  heuristics, whether general or domain-specific.

The HSMB measures preschool development in language, mathematics, nature and science, perception, reading, and social development. The sample included 1,000 children (36-60 months old) who participated in the Head Start Program and received all language, mathematics, and social routing items in fall of 1985. Loadings on the first factor were high, and eigenvalues obtained from the PCA suggested that one (or possibly two) dimensions were present in the data. Loadings of rotated principal components suggested that at least three factors corresponding to the subtests were  present. The structure was clarified by MDS plots, showing that items were located in distinct sectors corresponding to their subtest. However, items having the highest IRT discrimination parameters were clustered toward the center, suggesting that the measures have a strong common factor and unique variance related to each subtest. Practically, this justifies both a common scale for all subtests when an overall measure of achievement is needed and individual subtest scaling when information on particular skills is required. Agreement between PCA and MDS can be used to reinforce the validity of the principal components model. Seven tables and four figures are provided. (SLD)",

The adaptive testing model proposed is based on parameter-free predictive distribution. Aitchison and Dunsmore define statistical prediction analysis as the use of data obtained from an informative experiment in the past to make some reasonable statement about the outcome of the future experiment. Use of the approach's predictive density function and item selection procedure and terminating criteria is discussed. A small-scale exploration study compared the approach with A. Wald's sequential probability ratio test (1947), M. F. Lord's flexi-level test (1971), R. J. Owen's Bayesian strategy (1975), and F. C. Samejima's  maximum likelihood strategy (1977). The various approaches could not be placed on equal base in terms of data used. Results indicate that: (1) final predictive probabilities were significantly correlated with total scores; (2) the predicted adaptive testing performed better than sequential probability testing and almost as well as the Bayesian strategy in the area of mastery classification; (3) the benefit of adaptive testing could not be demonstrated in the area of the number of test items required; and (4) there was no effect on the number of misclassifications of students when different priors were used in predictive testing.

While the literature on teaching thinking emphasizes direct instruction both to introduce reasoning skill to students and to promote its transfer across domains and settings, it is theorized that this emphasis on instructional design may be misleading. The one-month residential citizen leadership school held in the summer of 1986 is described, and changes in participants' reasoning concerning public policy were studied. A pre-test/post-test design was used with a random sample of 24 of the 98 participants. Theoretical propositions are presented that associate the observed  changes in reasoning with the school's curriculum design. The observed improvement in critical thinking found in this study appears to be a by-product of curriculum design and is attributed to the additive effect of two curriculum design features: a multiple-case approach; and problem finding.

Appraisal and professional development should decrease teacher isolation and provide more time for reflection on action outside and inside the classroom.

Growth in a planned direction resulted from this evaluation process. The model used, one of evaluation as an active process occurring in a political situation, is adaptable to many situations.

        "description":"This cross-cultural study examined how students assessed as having different personality types (as designated by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) define peace, what attitudes these students hold toward peace, and the influence these students feel that have on the future. The sample was 378 students (ages 14-18 years) from West Germany, Poland, the United States, and China. The Peace Issues: Attitudes and Values Questionnaire was used. Respondents defined peace in personal terms, were not sure how to work toward peace, and felt they have an influence on their future. Differences were identified in methods to achieve peace, optimism toward acquiring peace, and attitudes toward the future among the four cultural groups and personality types. (Author/SLD)",

The formats were: (1) true/false; (2) multiple choice; (3) matching; (4) MDT Multiple Digit Testing, in which a machine scores fill-in-the-blanks; (5) fill-in-the-blanks; (6) short answers; and (7) essay. A total of 1,440 survey questionnaires (the Survey of Student Opinions about Methods of Educational Testing) completed at a Midwestern university by students exposed to the MDT method obtained information about student opinions. The MDT was not as well received as were more familiar tests. Students thought themselves less able as test takers. When the sample was controlled for appropriateness to the class, the MDT compared with fill-in-the-blanks for evaluative  power and preference. The machine-scored test is practical for teacher use. Eleven figures are presented, and an appendix includes the survey. (SLD)",

        "description":"A recent innovation in the area of educational measurement is MDT multi-digit testing, a machine-scored near-equivalent to &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; testing. The MDT method is based on long lists (or &quot;Answer Banks&quot;) that contain up to 1,000 discrete answers, each with a three-digit label. Students taking an MDT multi-digit test mark the appropriate three-digit response on special answer sheets for machine scoring. As expected, attitudes about MDT multi-digit testing vary significantly among students at Illinois State University who participated in its pioneer usage. Data from questionnaires given in one semester to 1,440 students show that 41% had unfavorable attitudes toward the testing method, while the remainder were neutral (36%) or had favorable perceptions (23%). This paper  examines 10 variables to determine which relate to favorable and unfavorable attitudes about the MDT multi-digit technique. Apart from instructor-related factors, the variables related to favorable attitudes toward MDT testing include greater familiarity/experience with the method and higher academic performance. Five figures are presented, and an appendix contains the survey used (the Survey of Student Opinions about Methods of Educational Testing). (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The effects of feedback about the ratings of other judges on subsequent ratings using the Nedelsky method and the ability of judges to retain or eliminate options in a manner consistent with the judgments of minimally competent examinees were studied using data from a basic algebra examination administered to 227 college students in 1987. The instrument used included 35 four-option multiple-choice items and was administered to the subjects at the start of an introductory statistics course to identify those in need of remedial instruction. Seven experienced instructors (judges) provided item ratings. Feedback did have an effect. Correlations between judges' estimates of item difficulty and the actual item difficulty increased slightly on the second rating. Improvements in both  correlations and the accuracy of option elimination suggest that iterative procedures may be of value with the Nedelsky method. The requirement that judges evaluate individual options in a Nedelsky procedure can lead to accurate assessments of the plausibility of options. Nine tables present the study results. (SLD)",

Second, using small monetary incentives (quarter, half dollar, dollar) and a raffle for a professional journal to encourage responding to a survey were unproductive, while establishing a communication network  (newsletters) with former students was productive.

Participants, recruited in the third trimester of pregnancy, were low-education families with an annual income of less than $5,000, 85 percent of which were headed by a single parent with no work history. The major thrust of the intervention program was to influence and have impact on the permanent environment of the child, the family, and the home; and to support parent strategies that would enhance the child's development after intervention ceased. Among the findings of a longitudinal follow-up study, conducted 10 years later, or 65 of the 82 children who completed the program are the  following: (1) the FDRP had a positive impact on the children and families who participated in the intervention; (2) high quality early childhood intervention programs prevent the incidence and severity of juvenile delinquency in low-income communities; (3) program families tended to value prosocial attitudes in behavior, education, and family unity; (4) program children expressed positive feelings about themselves, took an active approach to personal problems, and saw schooling as a vital part of their lives; and (5) program girls functioned better in public schools than program boys.

Educational reform operates on the following loosely connected levels: (1) policy; (2) administration; and (3) practice. Policy can set the conditions for effective administration and practice, but it cannot predetermine how those decisions will be made: in order for reforms to be large-scale or long-term, there must be dialogue among policy, administration, and practice. Federal reform policies of the 1950s and 1960s are analyzed. The mistakes of past policymakers can be remedied by strengthening the connection between policymakers and practitioners. To be effective, reform policies must  do the following: (1) close the gap between policy and practice, in part by charging practitioners with the development of solutions rather than mandating requirements that have little or no basis in practice; (2) accommodate variability by creating policies that lead to better understanding of effective practice rather than discouraging and penalizing it; (3) learn that rules only set the standards of fairness and do not prescribe solutions to practical problems; and (4) create organizations that foster and encourage reforms of practice.

The goals was to assess the effects of coordinated programming that allowed groups of these students with the weakest academic skills to attend the same classes together and have the same counselor. In this way, the instructors and the counselors could work together as a team and the students would have a less isolated social environment than normally experienced by college students. The assumption was that these factors would work together to provide the best chance for the students to overcome their difficulties and be successful in college. The research compared students in this coordinated program with similar students whose schedules were not coordinated. The academic performance of  the two groups were measured by their grades, rates of passing courses, accumulation of college credits, and retention rates. The results showed that as a group the students with coordinated schedules did not perform better than other students. The structure of the coordinated program will be reconsidered, but it is possible that one semester was not enough time for the benefits of the program to manifest themselves. Additional study is necessary. Statistical data are presented on nine tables. (VM)",

The proposed Magnet School Expansion Act of 1987 would increase aid to this program, which has been successful as a means of desegregating school systems across the nation. Witnesses, including members of Congress, school superintendents, and members of boards of education, testified on the success of magnet schools, the need for more funding, and the preference of this method over bussing for desegregation. Suggestions were made on how to improve the distribution of funds. The second part of the session addressed the need to continue special funding of school districts to compensate them for local and federal activities. These funds are needed since areas  with a high federal presence do not have enough taxable property to generate adequate revenues for schools. Witnesses compared high impact districts with similar ones that do not have a federal presence to show the extent to which the impacted district may be at a disadvantage. Many tables, graphs, and illustrations were offered as evidence to demonstrate the need for the continuance both of these aid programs. (VM)",

        "description":"Written and oral testimony presented in this document concerns legislative and policy considerations for achieving full employment. Although the Reagan Administration cites a low unemployment figure for the nation, there remain almost eight million persons out of work and more than a million &quot;discouraged workers&quot; who have given up trying to find work. Five million others work part-time only because they cannot find full-time jobs. For blacks, women, and the elderly the employment situation is worse. The country needs a comprehensive policy to put people back to work. Testimony and written statements were presented to the hearing, some in favor of new policies and some in support of the present measures that are in place to reduce unemployment. The bill under consideration is the  Economic Bill of Rights Act. It calls for appropriate Executive action to secure the right of employment and to give special attention to neglected mandates of other employment bills. Much of the testimony offered partisan opinions on the state of the economy, on the way that labor issues have been handled in previous Democratic and Republican Administrations, and on legislation and policy already in force. Proponents of new policy want a more aggressive commitment to implementing full employment. (VM)",

Older blacks are the poorest group among the elderly and they are among the most impoverished groups in our nation today. They are also among the most poorly housed groups, and are more likely to experience health problems than aged persons in general. They are at greater risk of being criminal  victims than other Americans. As a group, older blacks have borne more social, economic, and psychological damage than other groups because of racial discrimination.

The original objectives of the assessment component were the following: (1) to conduct an initial screen test to identify clients who are immediately job ready; and (2) to measure the competency levels, interests, and service needs of those who are not job ready. The assessment package has the following parts: (1) job readiness determination; (2) social services needs checklist; and (3) a written assessment test, which tests reading ability, mathematics ability, job search knowledge, and occupational interests. The  benefits of a well designed assessment that is integrated with other parts of the welfare-employment system can be substantial--both to the program in terms of developing staff capabilities in case management and client assignment, and to the client in terms of establishing realistic personal goals.

        "description":"Between 1979 and 1983 the noninstitutionalized Medicaid population grew by 210,000 people, or one percent. In comparison, because of a severe economic recession, there was a 37 percent increase in the number of people in poverty during the same period. The Medicaid population growth rate is relatively small for the following reasons: (1) Congress tightened Medicaid eligibility by passing the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which restricts eligibility for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (everyone who receives AFDC is also eligible for Medicaid), thus affecting the 52 percent of the noninstitutionalized Medicaid population who are AFDC-Medicaid recipients; (2) most states, by not increasing the income eligibility limits, did not act to counter the  effects of inflation (which rose 37 percent) on the purchasing power of the poor receiving cash assistance. In 1979, 58 percent of the Medicaid population had earnings below the poverty level; in 1983, 73 percent of the Medicaid population had poverty incomes. The proportion of children covered by Medicaid fell from 49 to 46 percent. Regional differences in the proportions of the poor covered by Medicaid remained constant between 1979 and 1983, but there were substantial changes in the growth of the Medicaid population. While the noninstitutionalized Medicaid population became poorer, Medicaid also covered a smaller proportion of the poor. This state of affairs has particular ramifications for the 24 percent of all children living in poverty and for the relatively large poverty population  in the South.

        "description":"Charles Murray's book, &quot;Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950-1980,&quot; proposes the abolition of benefit programs for all working-aged persons for the following reasons: (1) it is logically impossible for the government to aid the poor by creating incentives for people to become poor; (2) since the mid-1960s the United States has so strengthened these incentives that the poverty rate has stopped falling; and (3) the principal victims of this process have been a segment of the black population who have been devastated by their dependence on government programs. Although Murray's first proposition is plausible, considering the history of welfare programs since the 1960s, there is no evidence to support his second and third propositions. Between 1973 and 1980 the number of Aid  to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) recipients remained essentially unchanged but the number of persons in poverty rose by 6.3 million. And AFDC payments had no effect on the family structures of the poor black population. An examination of Murray's data reveals that he disregarded economic trends because he misread the statistics. Murray is right in his basic claim that &quot;economic growth during the 1950s and 1960s was strong but during the 1970s it was weak and progress in reducing poverty ceased,&quot; but he overdramatizes it in his book. His world view is not wrong; it is incomplete: he understates the system's self-correcting tendencies. A table illustrates some of the data. (BJV)",

TRIM2, a microsimulation model that simulated the eligibility and benefit rules of the AFDC program on a state-by-state basis, showed that there had been a dramatic decline after 1981 in the rate at which AFDC families were applying for and receiving benefits. This phenomenon was caused by the change in the coding of subfamilies (adults who live with children but are not their biological parents) by the Census Bureau on the Current Population Survey, which is the basic input file used to compute eligibility. There was no massive behavioral change on the part of AFDC eligibles in the early 1980s: between 150,000 and 400,000 subfamilies (depending on the year) were omitted from  the eligibility estimates between 1967 and 1980. Comparative analyses of the AFDC program that encompass the period before and after the coding change might be impaired by the impact of the change. Participation rates are much lower than previously believed, and are perhaps not at a saturation level. Analysis of trends in the characteristics of AFDC eligibles from 1979 to 1984 reveal the following changes after 1980: (1) more subfamily and family heads were likely to be black, female, young and never married; (2) more family and subfamily heads lived in higher income households and contributed to a lower percentage of household income; and (3) more subfamily heads had a child under 6 years of age. Implications for policy and research are discussed. Data are presented on 14 tables and  figures. A bibliography is included. (BJV)",

As a result of increased flexibility, decreased federal funds, and continuing debate about welfare reform, there is now considerable variability among states in the types of employment and training services and program available to welfare recipients. This report documents the status of employment and training programs and policies for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), general assistance, and food stamps in all states. The historic context of Federal welfare-employment policy is analyzed. Among the characteristics of state work-welfare programs identified were the following: (1) overall, states have  made considerable use of the federal AFDC and food stamp work program options available since 1981; (2) there was considerable diversity in the combinations of options chosen; (3) there is considerable variability across states in their political and financial commitment to work-welfare; (4) there was a high level of anxiety across the nation about the direction Federal policy will take regarding work-welfare issues; (5) political priority on work-welfare at the state level has increased; (6) the primary activity offered in programs is job search; (7) the Job Training and Partnership Act is increasingly important in the programs. Implications for federal policy are identified. The most critical need now is a clear and long-term commitment by the Federal Government to fund work-welfare  programs.

        "description":"This transcript of a Congressional hearing concerns improving and strengthening the quality of education in Boston and other cities. The testimony centers around the systemwide planning process that has established the Boston Plan for Excellence in the Public Schools and the incentive programs that have been implemented. A major issue is federal and state involvement in such plans and policies. Suggestions for this involvement are the following: (1) funding for nationwide replication of successful educational programs; (2) a student loan forgiveness program for college graduates who teach where teacher shortages are present; (3) the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; (4) more research upon which programs and policies can be based; and (5) rewards for  outstanding teachers and schools. Other witnesses endorsed a radical restructuring of the schools and changes in the role of the teacher that would make teaching a true profession. Parental involvement and choice are notions that are being discussed in many locales. This could make schools compete for students, thus forcing them to improve what they have to offer. (VM)",

Relevant research literature is reviewed. Cross-sectional data indicated that high school dropouts were more involved with cigarettes and illicit drugs than were graduates and that those who obtained a graduate equivalency diploma were the most intensively involved. Event history analysis indicated that prior use of cigarettes, marijuana, and other illicit drugs increases the propensity to drop out and that the earlier the initiation into drugs, the greater the probability of premature school leaving. Thus, preventing or at least delaying the initiation of drug use will reduce the incidence of dropping out of high school. These findings  have broad implications for the development of intervention strategies for at risk students. Statistical data are presented on seven tables. A list of 58 references is included.

        "description":"Measured by cash income, the rate of poverty among the age 65 and older population has fallen dramatically, especially since 1974--from 25 percent in 1968 to 14.1 percent in 1983. However, this decline is the result more of an increase in poverty rates for the nonelderly in recent years than of major progress in reducing poverty for those over 65. The decline is likely to continue. For elderly persons at all levels of income, Social Security benefits have contributed to growth in incomes. Each group of persons turning 65 in one year tends to be better off than the previous year's group. But such gains do not help those who are already elderly. The number of poor elderly has been dropping since 1980 but at a slower pace than suggested by the decline in the poverty rate. The number  of poor elderly in 1983 was higher than the number in 1973. More than three-fourths of the elderly poor are women and minorities; the proportion of elderly in these groups has been growing. In 1983 women constituted 71.1 percent of the elderly poor, although they accounted for 59.1 percent of the total elderly; 56 percent of all elderly women are poor. Women over 65 living as unrelated individuals on the average get only about one-third as much from wages and salaries as do their male counterparts. Their risks of being poor change dramatically with their living arrangements. Poverty rates for elderly minorities continue to be much higher than those for whites. Other characteristics of the elderly poor are described, and policy implications are discussed. Data are presented on 11 tables  and figures. (BJV)",

        "description":"The average minority family is economically no better off than it was in 1980. While White families gained 4.1 percent in disposable income (income from all sources net of taxes) after adjusting for inflation, Black families had a decline in real disposable income of 2.1 percent, and Hispanic families had an increase of only 1 percent. The Black elderly had income gains, but not as much as the White elderly. Black unrelated individuals also had gains, and their income rose relative to that of White unrelated individuals. But Black families headed by a person under age 65 made virtually no progress between 1980 and 1984. Black families in the top 40 percent of the income distribution did not make gains comparable to those of their White counterparts. Among the factors contributing  to the relative deterioration in minority family income were the following: (1) high unemployment; (2) Reagan Administration policies, which led to a more severe recession than might have occurred otherwise; (3) cuts in income support programs, which exacerbated the effects of the recession because minority families, who have lower average earnings, are more dependent on public assistance even when they are employed; and (4) cuts in programs to increase long-term earnings--employment, training, and educational programs. These outcomes could have been predicted before the policies were implemented; it is easy to understand why many claim that the Reagan Administration has been unfair to minorities.

Among the conclusions are the following: (1) nonprofit child-serving agencies provide a variety of services, vary widely in size, and have a diverse clientele; (2) the government was the largest source of revenues for child-serving nonprofits in Fiscal Year (FY) 1982, contributing 42 percent of total funds. Private grants provided about 26 percent of the funds, and income from service fees, dues, and charges accounted for over 20 percent; (3) large and medium-sized agencies rely more  heavily on government funding than do small ones; (4) in 1982 government support for child-serving nonprofits was cut by 3.4 percent, a figure smaller than the average 6.3 percent cut for all nonprofit agencies; (5) social services, day care, education/research, and recreation agencies all had losses of 5 percent or more; (6) while government support was declining, demand for services either increased or remained stable for the agencies; (7) many agencies more than replaced government funding losses in FY 1982 by turning to other sources of support, but 43 percent of the agencies suffered a real decline in revenues; (8) most of the increased revenue came from dues, fees, and service charges; and (9) private contributions increased in FY 1982.

In the interest of expediency, the analytical section that had been featured in previous annual reports since 1953 has been deleted from the 1987 report. Among the highlights of the 1987 data are the following: (1) there were 89.5 million households, a net increase of 8.7 million since 1980; (2) the proportion of households maintained by a married couple with children under age 18 has declined by 13 percentage points since 1970; (3) there were 3.19 persons per family, down 0.10 persons from the 1980 average; (4) the number of householders under 25 years of age has fallen by 1.4  million since 1980; and (5) the average net increase in the number of one-person households from 1980 to 1987 was 340,000 less than the corresponding figure for the 1970s. Data are presented on 25 tables.

One hundred and five students, some of whom served as control group by not participating in the program, were studied. Although it was not found that participation in the program improved at-risk students' attendance, grades, behavior ratings, or disciplinary actions, the study did show that it was possible to easily identify at-risk students from existing school records. At-risk students in both the treatment group and the control group remained at risk. Observational and anecdotal data of students' participation in the program showed  that students did receive benefits sufficient to make them willing to continue their involvement in the program, although their level of improvement was minimal.

Interviews with students, teachers, and administrators at an urban all-black high school selected by the National Center on Effective Secondary Schools revealed the following: (1) for teachers, academic success is based primarily on a student's &quot;positive attitude&quot; as well as his or her ability to &quot;work hard.&quot; The responsibility for a student's academic success or failure lies in the student's actions and behaviors; (2) the college preparatory students generally agreed with their teachers that a good attitude and a willingness to work hard are necessary for academic success.  They also found other factors important, such as self-confidence, class participation, extra-curricular activities, social flexibility, friendliness and humility, and self-motivation; (3) students believe that their teachers have a responsibility to be competent, to instruct them, to abide by the general principles of respect and fairness, and to learn to adjust to the student's individual needs. They want curricula that relate to their values and heritage. Three tables and figures illustrate some of the data. A short list of references is included. (BJV)",

The following implicit instructional goals of PLAN were revealed: (1) creating a vision of the future; (2) redefining the participants' self-image; and (3) building a supportive community. These goals were supported through a network of teacher behaviors, particularly sociolinguistic strategies imbedded in the teacher's speech, which wove the cultural characteristics of Hispanic students with academic content in an environment that encouraged learning. PLAN's success may be partially attributable to the  strategic use of language in motivating students. The instructional goals and the strategies used to implement them are illustrated on an accompanying handout. A brief bibliography is included. (BJV)",

Since 1981 the Reagan Administration has been systematically dismantling the nation's housing programs, leaving tens of thousands of low-income people homeless. In 1982 there were 1,088 homeless families in New York City; by 1987 the number had risen to 5,100. Among the witnesses at this hearing were victims of the Administration's housing policy: people who have lost their homes because of cuts in low-income programs, and people who will soon lose their homes if the present cuts continue. Other witnesses include Congressman Mario Biaggi, Mayor Edward I. Koch, and Andrew Cuomo. Prepared statements, charts, and  additional information are appended. (BJV)",

It enabled clients to earn a full credit and up to $200 ($3.35 an hour) for successfully completing the program. Among the major findings of an evaluation of the program are the following: (1) a total of 216 clients were enrolled, and the average daily attendance was 167.8; (2) the age of the clients ranged from 14 to 20 with a median age of 16; (3) about half the clients were males, half females; (4) approximately 87 percent of the clients were black, and 11 percent were non-minority; (5) data from the 137 clients who took a reading or mathematics pretest and posttest, and who attended 80 percent  of the program, revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in their reading comprehension and mathematics computation; (6) the median grade equivalent of reading pretest scores was 7.3; of posttest scores, 8.7; (7) of the 136 clients in the evaluation sample, approximately 46 percent gained one or more years in reading; (8) the median grade equivalent of mathematics pretest scores was 7.4, and the median posttest scores, 8.5; and (9) of the 121 clients in the evaluation sample, approximately 58 percent gained one or more years in mathematics. Due to several problems it was not possible to collect posttest data on non-client individuals who served as controls; therefore it was impossible to determine the degree to which all the positive change could be attributed to  the program. Data are presented on 24 tables and figures. (Author/BJV)",

        "description":"This issue features articles on basic skills enrichment for summer job programs and on the recent revisions to the Job Training Partnership Act's (JTPA's) performance standards system. &quot;Basic Skills and Summer Enrichment: An Interview with Gordon Berlin&quot; focuses on the summer enrichment movement in general and the Summer Training and Education Program (STEP) in particular. It looks at key elements of summer enrichment, broader issues that have been addressed through STEP, the role of the schools, and the movement toward a comprehensive system. &quot;Program Standards: A New Chance for Employability&quot; (Lori Strumpf) is a close look at the first major revisions of the JTPA's performance standards system. It considers issues that practitioners and policymakers had raised over the impact  of JTPA's standards on the population the system was serving and the services offered. The article details how the revisions address these issues and establish performance standards that encourage higher quality services. Challenges for youth policymakers and practitioners are also discussed. &quot;Notes from the Field&quot; (Andrew Hahn) offers highlights from a series of two-day training institutes on summer enrichment programs for state and local JTPA practitioners. &quot;CHR Notes&quot; (Erik Butler) summarizes recent ventures in which the Center for Human Resources has participated.

Part 1 reviews the central issues with which the British and Irish pilot projects are concerned. The three issues are fundamental and general and should be of significance for other countries. They are (1) meeting of the assessment/certification needs of lower-attaining pupils, (2) certification and assessment of a greater variety of achievements of students of all abilities, and (3) recognition of new certificates and forms of assessment. Part 2 describes the Manchester pilot project's assessment work, because it provides an example of  answers to questions raised in Part 1. Sample forms are provided.

It draws particularly on examples from the 30 pilot projects that formed part of the European Community's second program on young people's transition from education to adult and working life. Part I examines why links are important. The main purpose is to analyze what use schools (and firms) make of links and what support is needed at local levels to make best use of them. Part II describes the way links contribute to four important functions of schools and education systems: the provision of guidance, the school curriculum, the provision of inservice training for teachers, and the school's role and  image in its local community. Part III illustrates how school-industry linking gives rise to new linking structures or services at the local level. Descriptions are provided of various kinds of links as they are used in pilot projects in different countries. Part IV presents a set of recommendations for the successful development of school-industry links in the future. Appendixes include descriptions of transition programs for youth in Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, and Denmark, and a list of contacts for all pilot projects mentioned in the text.

Section I discusses roles for parents and parents' associations as partners with schools. Section II describes the role of schools in making parents more active partners. Section III describes how parents can be invited, encouraged, or helped to contribute to the life and work  of secondary schools in the double role as parents of children in the school and as members of the local community.

        "description":"Education for economic growth has become a rallying cry in state capitols in recent years. Initiatives in every state, prompted by legislators, governors, and the business sector, are intended to upgrade teaching and learning in the face of a dynamic, global economy. Competing theories describe the nature of that economy and argue over whether the United States will become a two-tiered society; however, the antagonists agree over the role of education in teaching prospective employees how to adapt their skills to meet the needs of a changing economy. Although education appears not to have figured prominently in business decisions on where to expand or relocate, this situation may be changing. More states are concentrating on nurturing homegrown businesses instead of chasing after  that once-in-a-lifetime business location decision. The needs of employers are important to state efforts to link education and economic growth; just as important, however, are the needs of the potential employees (the students). Because the backgrounds of students are more diverse than in the past, policymakers will have to target their educational programs more effectively. At the same time, demographic trends indicate that citizens of one state will have a vested interest in the education provided to young people in other states. Educators want to be more involved in decisions affecting state economic development, but institutional linkages need to be forged. Although the verdict remains out on the impact of all this new activity, it is time for state policymakers to begin raising the  appropriate questions. (KC)",

        "description":"Education and training programs have changed significantly during the past five years in most large U.S. corporations. Rapid technological change and the adoption by many companies of new strategies in response to such factors as heightened global competition and deregulation have imposed new skill and knowledge needs. A larger proportion of employees in all major job categories is now involved each year in formal training than five years ago. Growth in participation rates has been highest for managers and professionals as well as sales and marketing personnel. Despite the fact that diminished earnings have compelled some companies to reduce staff, most have increased the number of professionals engaged in training. As corporate leaders commit themselves to reducing or containing  education and training costs, more attention is being paid to linking training programs to companies' strategic goals. The needs of departments and individuals are increasingly determined by joint trainer-manager explorations and performance appraisal procedures. New technologies, including video, computer-aided instruction, interactive video, and satellite broadcasting, are having important effects on training. Corporate departments are becoming better equipped to conduct training programs and are beginning to play a more active role in oversight of training activities throughout the company. (MN)",

The 43 students constituting the survey population were enrolled in the graduate programs of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Students had to be at least 25 years old and have been out of school for at least 3 years to be considered a returning student. The students were interviewed twice, once in the first semester of their return to school and again a year later. The major barriers perceived by the returning adult students were increase in stress, parking in and around campus, balancing family and school time, balancing job and school time, and spending time with immediate  family. The problem of balancing family and school time became more severe over the year; however, the severity of the other barriers remained the same. The barriers related to difficulties in obtaining campus information, following registration procedures, and obtaining information from the graduate school decreased over time. Other than an increase in severity of stress, there were no changes in psychosocial barriers over time. As expected, situational barriers were perceived as the most serious and did not abate over time. Because only 3 of the 43 persons in the study withdrew from school after the second interview, the relationship between perceived barriers and persistence/withdrawal could not be tested. (MN)",

        "description":"Primarily, vocational educators should work with business and industry to ensure that the vocational curriculum taught to youth and adults is relevant to consumer, life, and job skills. Trends that have curriculum implications for vocational education are fewer workers, growth in the service sector, constantly changing job skills, a majority of new workers from disadvantaged groups, and increased graduation requirements. Curriculum content and materials must be developed with these trends in mind, and the business and industry community that will hire the potential workers should provide assistance. Concerns regarding the use of business and industry representatives in curriculum development include educators' fear of involving business, industry, and military representatives;  reluctance of business and industry to participate; and time consciousness. If business, industry, and military leaders are convinced that their efforts will make a difference in the educational process, they will contribute their time, expertise, and resources. Benefits from involving business and industry are active and effective advisory councils, realistic curriculum content and materials, students trained to do jobs that are needed, effective cooperative education programs, and identification of business and industry training needs. These needs include vocational students with basic skills and customized training. (YLB)",

Of the essential ingredients offered by the study participants, the following eight were selected for a thorough content analysis: keep technically up to date, be motivated, be interested in the student, set directions, evaluate performance, develop a positive  attitude, use community resources, and have a high-quality supervised occupational experience program for each student.

Of these, 511,973 earned scores qualifying them for equivalency credit. Thus, approximately 74 percent of the examinees who completed the test battery in 1987 earned scores that were sufficient to qualify for the diploma awarded by their state, territory, or province. Departments or ministries of education in the United States and Canada awarded 472,007 credentials (5 percent more than in 1986) based on the GED test results. The average age of the 1987 examinees was 26.7 years, with nearly 29 percent being 19 or younger and 11 percent being 40 or older. The majority of examinees (724,092) took the English language edition of the  test, 31,757 took the Spanish edition, 1,640 took the French edition, and 878 took a special edition (Braille, large-print, or audiocassette). The examinees completed an average of 9.9 years of schooling before leaving high school. Over half the examinees reported that they planned to continue their education and training beyond the high school level. Since 1971, the following states have had the largest increases in the number of GED diplomas awarded: Vermont (45 percent), North Carolina (36 percent), Alaska (35 percent), and Oklahoma (27 percent).

It introduces the building, Sutton Centre; the town, Sutton-in-Ashfield, North Nottinghamshire; community education; and the period of time in which the story is set. Nineteen chapters concentrate upon the actions and the arguments that took place as the feasibility study, planning, and development for the center progressed. The whole range of public services that were brought together under the center's roof are discussed in the order in which they appeared in the history of the center. The services include the secondary school, recreation center, and specialized agencies. How the center attracted attention to itself and to the town is discussed. Another focus is the  challenge that the center presented to the public sector to resolve its problems and bring forth more of its potential. An important part of the book is its emphasis on the major political and economic changes that took place during the seventies. Thus, the story also involves how the building, and especially those in it, responded to changes in the meaning and financing of care--the quality of their reactions as well as their actions. The final chapter discusses issues that were raised by the sense of innovation that the building represented. Two sets of issues are included: those posed by the building itself and those promoted by it. (YLB)",

        "description":"In the past, employer-provided, job-specific training for new employees and continuing education for those who wished to advance in their jobs were often sufficient to keep abreast of technological changes. This is no longer the case, however. The substantial monetary and time expenditures associated with retraining programs that are begun only after workers' skills have become obsolete underscore the necessity of developing ongoing retraining programs geared toward persons who are currently employed. Business, labor unions, and government can all play a role in funding and/or providing retraining. Funders can make their influence felt by selecting the training provider and shaping the content of training. It is also possible to combine federal, state, and local government  funding with union or business funds, as has been done in such states as Michigan, Delaware, and Alabama. The following all have a place in comprehensive retraining programs intended to prevent skill obsolescence: a counseling/educational guidance component; an assessment system; a support system (to provide such things as financial aid, child care, workplace study areas, and recognition of trainees' achievements); basic, vocational, and general skills programs; and management development programs.

Because adult learning is usually more self-directed and because adults are largely free to determine their learning objectives, they must learn to manage their learning even more than young people who are still in school. Several courses in learning management have been developed to meet the growing need for instruction in this area. Although most are based on the premise that learning how to learn can and should be an integral part of learning a content area, at least one undergraduate level course (part of the Cognitive Learning Strategies Project at  the University of Texas at Austin) is devoted to learning to learn as an area of study apart from any other content area. The latter course focuses on executive control and knowledge acquisition processes, active study skills, and support strategies (such as reducing anxiety and dealing with procrastination). According to one researcher, memorizing, understanding, and doing (MUD) are the keys to learning. Proceeding from this premise, teachers are urged to use few formal lectures, plan for group work, use nonassessed worksheets, and allow a pondering period in each class session. Group problem-based learning is another method of enhancing learning management skills. It is particularly well-suited to worksite learning management programs. (MN)",

        "description":"Training and development professionals play a unique role in helping people improve their performance by using all aspects of the work environment to make those improvements occur. These professions are currently debating the existence of an integrated theoretical framework and how it might support practice in their field. Human performance technology (HPT) has been proposed as a systems-based field of study for training and development. The goal of the HPT field is to use systems approaches to ensure that individuals have the knowledge, skills, motivation, and environmental supports required to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. The conceptual domain of HPT is defined by management, development, and systems functions. In terms of professional preparation, academic  programs for training and development should be based on a set of core competencies and a unique theoretical base such as human performance technology. Jacobs has listed 11 propositions from the study of HPT. The following are among those propositions: human performance and behavior are different and knowledge of the difference is important for achieving goals in HPT; organizational as well as individual goals must be considered in defining worthy performance; and exemplary performance provides the most logical referent for determining job performance standards.

        "description":"One in every four families with children under the age of 18 is a single-parent family (up from 1 of every 10 in 1970). The vast majority of single-parent families are low-income families consisting of a mother (usually with relatively little formal education) and her young children. Many female single heads of households are either displaced homemakers or adolescent mothers. Although they generally have a more healthy economic status than their female counterparts, single fathers are often confronted with serious career-related problems as they find their sole child-rearing role conflicting with work expectations. As the sole support of their families, single parents are concerned with obtaining a good job and achieving economic independence. However, job training and job  placement can only be effective in the long run if program developers consider the other needs of single parents: emotional support, job-seeking skills, basic skills instruction, outreach and recruitment, child care, self-concept building, skills assessment, nontraditional job skills, and parenthood education. High school dropout prevention programs are also important for adolescent single parents. Difficulties in locating available resources often prevent single parents from learning of career and other services. Support and referral networks and newsletters are an inexpensive and effective strategy for communicating with, educating, and supporting all categories of single parents. (MN)",

The shift from an industrialized society to a post-industrial society and the growth in service industries are not favorable for deaf adults who have not traditionally been trained for technically oriented and high-growth service jobs. In addition to the dilemmas faced by deaf adults because of rapid technological and career changes, they are also confronted by the movement toward a participatory democracy that places greater demands on the citizens. In light of these issues, the idea of lifelong learning must be fostered for deaf adults to keep them abreast of the social, political, and economic changes. The theories and practices of education for hearing adults are quite  applicable to the education of deaf adults. Experiential learning, self-directedness in learning, pedagogical and andragogical approaches, and the fostering of autonomy are equally important to the education of deaf adults. (YLB)",

The first, called the Basic Skills Project, aimed at facilitating more effective cooperation among Idaho secondary school academic and vocational teachers to reinforce student mastery of basic skills. A part-time state project director worked with five teams of high school vocational and academic educators, providing in-service training and technical assistance in developing mechanisms to increase collaboration. The second project studied was an extensive curriculum revision project at Benson Polytechnic High School in Portland, Oregon. Semistructured interviews with key staff and other teachers, observations, analyses of project documents, and a  levels-of-concern instrument were used to study the two projects. In the second year of the Idaho project, the staff from the five pilot sites served as resource people for five new sites, thus continuing to build on the collaboration that had developed at the original project sites. The Oregon curriculum revision project was similarly well received and generally successful. The study resulted in a framework for teacher cooperation, according to which teacher cooperation is necessitated by environmental influences, is enhanced by state-level and local administrative support, and results in tangible benefits to teachers and students. (This report also identifies barriers to and principles enhancing cooperation and illustrative practices.) An 11-item reference list and an annotated  bibliography are also included. (MN)",

        "description":"Vocational education was largely established on the principle of nontransferability. However, vocational education and academic education have many similarities. Indeed, the difference between basic and academic skills has often been defined in terms of rigor. Basic skills are those concrete skills that are generally taught at the elementary level, whereas academic skills are those that require an understanding of laws, principles, and phenomena. If most people learn best by moving from the concrete to the abstract, then a society that promotes compulsory education must acknowledge the value of vocational education as a method of educating students in concrete knowledge that can extend as far as possible into abstract thought. Vocationalism often reinforces academic concepts, and  in some instances, vocational educators teach academics (especially basic skills) in order to teach a vocational skill. Studies indicate that little collaboration exists between vocational and academic teachers. In view of the technological and information booms that are underway and increasing skills demands placed on entry workers, vocational and academic teachers must increase their understanding of what each other teaches, with vocational teachers assuming the role of a reinforcer who acknowledges and respects the value of other subject areas.

Data on the labor market behavior of nearly 300 male illegal aliens apprehended in the Chicago metropolitan area indicated that the average alien was 30.6 years old, had been in the United States an average of 3.4 years, and received $4.52 per hour (in 1983)  as opposed to $4.42 received by Mexican nationals and $4.73 received by other nationals. Only 16 percent (mostly in restaurant and service jobs) reported wages below the federal minimum level.

The justification for the practice is based largely on research findings claiming a high level of validity for such tests in predicting job performance. More recently, such claims have been translated into the dollar increases in productivity that would result if optimal testing strategies were used for selecting employees for jobs. However, a careful review of the claims indicates that they are not supported by research evidence. The utility of any selection procedure depends on (1) its ability to predict worker performance better than alternatives; (2) the selection ratio of employer openings to applicants; and  (3) the economic value of the better employee selection relative to the costs of the selection. On the first point, the evidence that general ability tests are superior to other selection criteria in predicting the various indicators of worker performance is not convincing. Furthermore, much of the research on ability testing for job selection ignores the second point, and much contains many unsubstantiated conclusions and overstatements with regard to the third point.

The listing of competencies was developed after an extensive literature review, interviews with educational professionals and persons employed in information occupations, and input from a Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) committee of 16 information systems experts. The questionnaire thus developed was mailed to 1,017 members of the Association of Information Systems Professionals. Responses were obtained from 657 participants (64.6 percent). A second-round questionnaire consisting of 318 competency statements in eight broad skill areas was then completed by 475 (72.3 percent) of the participants from round 1. Both a Delphi analysis and an Analysis of Distinction indicated that all  eight broad skill areas were rated as essential competencies for information systems workers. Of the 290 items deemed essential or very important, 213 (73.45 percent) were in the communications, interpersonal, and technological skills categories. The other four skill areas--management, problem-solving, entrepreneurial, and business skills--also accounted for essential competencies for information systems workers.

The relationship between the state and adult education is one area, however, that has remained relatively neglected by researchers. In many countries, adult education has been largely the responsibility of voluntary bodies, which has perhaps obscured its political dimension. At the present time, however, both adult educators and adult students have become increasingly aware of the impact of the state on adult education. In Great Britain, for example, reductions in government funding of adult education have given the study of the state and adult education a particular immediacy. The following areas are particularly in need of further study: the impact of  adult education on the state over time; ways in which the state has affected adult education in Africa and Great Britain; and the question of political education and the effect of different government structures. Such studies should be based on a simple model in which state character (laissez-faire, colonial, or postcolonial), the nature of intervention (policies, supportive and constraining actions), and factors in effectiveness (political will, infrastructure) could be compared.

Following a review of literature that found only a few sources on prevocational agriculture programs, most of them guides for middle school curricula, a survey instrument was developed and mailed to 60 Iowa teachers of prevocational agriculture classes; 55 teachers returned the surveys. Analysis of the data revealed that the teachers averaged 10 years of teaching experience, had been teaching prevocational agriculture classes for about four years, and had about 46 students in each class. The most popular length of the prevocational agriculture classes was nine weeks, and the most popular year for the  course was eighth grade. The teachers listed a variety of topics as useful to teach in the agriculture course, especially horticulture, animal science, Future Farmers of America activities, agribusiness, careers, agronomy, agricultural mechanics, agriculture awareness, construction, and farm management. The study found that offering a prevocational agriculture class did not increase enrollment in regular vocational agriculture programs. Based on the findings of the study, recommendations are made for a prevocational agriculture curriculum. The study instrument and a list of programs surveyed are appended. (KC)",

The MEP is an active Army program providing leadership and advanced military occupational specialty technical training. The primary objectives of the study were to determine whether the revised Reserve Component Noncommissioned Officer Education Program is a viable alternative to the MEP for technicians, how technicians' participation in the MEP affects readiness, and how the MEP affects technicians personally (including leave and other benefits). The MEP and Revised Component Program were found to be generally similar in content, but the Revised Component Program courses are sometimes shorter. The MEP costs about three times more to attend than does the Revised Component Program. The  National Guard's readiness is not measurably affected by technicians' participation in the MEP, but daily unit operations are sometimes disrupted. The requirement to attend MEP training does not generally impose a financial hardship on technicians, but it can create some inconveniences.

Thirteen (38 percent) of these were randomly selected for review. Compliance officers in the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division substantiated child labor violations in 9 of the 13 cases. A total of 846 minors were found working longer hours or outside the time frames allowed under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Thirty-three minors were operating hazardous machinery, and two were under the minimum employment age of 14. Nine of the 13 cases reviewed were initiated as a result of a complaint; in six cases, the Department of Labor began its investigation within 1 month. However, response time in the other 3 complaints ranged from 4  to 16 months. The remaining four cases were directed investigations that were initiated by the Department of Labor rather than by complaint. Civil monetary penalties totaling $519,830 were assessed in nine of the cases. This was reduced to $206,730 through negotiations with employers in three of the cases, with employers paying the original amount in the other six cases. Injuries occurred to illegally employed minors in one of the five cases in which minors were found working in prohibited occupations. Twelve injuries were sustained by 11 employees, all of whom were operating meat-slicing devices. (MN)",

        "description":"This book analyzes the future of the United States in terms of people in their role as consumers and as employees. It uses conventional economic accounting procedures to document economic growth, but also employs more qualitative standards for measuring progress in eight basic categories of demand or amenity: food, housing, transportation, health, clothing and personal care, education, personal communication and business, and recreation and leisure. The first chapter of this 14-chapter report introduces the themes developed in the document and provides a summary and guide to the entire report. Following the introductory chapter, four major sections containing 11 chapters cover different elements of the American economic system: consumption networks, production networks, trade  networks, and people in production networks. Each part introduces a set of analytical tools for using national statistical series to look at economy-wide patterns of change. Each of the four parts also contains a discussion of issues unique to each amenity network. These examinations include a review of changes in patterns of consumer and government purchases, changes in the way producers combine to deliver products and services, and changes in the way people with different skills are linked together directly and indirectly in these networks. A fifth and final part contains two chapters dealing with policy and the future. Chapter 13 develops a set of hypotheses about the future structure of the economy built from a series of specific hypotheses concerning consumption, production, trade,  and labor. Chapter 14 reviews options for revising the regulations and incentives that shape the direction of United States economic growth. An appendix discusses data and methods. (KC)",

        "description":"Joint implications from five recent studies on occupational choice indicate that a more in-depth concentration on the occupational consistency or discontinuity of women and minorities will provide direction for future academic discipline and policy for this population. The discipline and policy process is potentially one of the most important areas in research because it begins to raise questions about concepts of occupation. The studies show the extent to which identities seem to organize occupational choice for all individuals. A set of occupations consistent with how these identities are put together seems to be emerging. There seems to be a sense of occupational persistence with upward mobility within the context of tribe, class, or gender. Arguably, two  factors--tribal/cultural concept and social class--seem to contribute to the relationship between ethnicity and mathematical performance at each educational stage. Both affect family behavior patterns, which, in turn, powerfully affect children's school performance. Literature indicates that girls' occupational expectations depend on how they expect to allocate their time during adulthood between the labor force and work in the home. Career choices seem to reflect how and when to resolve the conflict between achievement in the labor force and family responsibilities. (YLB)",

        "description":"Vocational education programs adapted for use in rural areas are often unsuccessful because they do not meet the unique needs of rural communities. Rural school districts have limited financial resources, and few rural schools can offer a wide range of programs or special services to students. Smaller rural communities need persons having multiple skills, including those necessary for entrepreneurship and jobs in small business. Whatever form it takes, vocational education can only meet the needs of the rural population if it provides training that would equip individuals to remain in their community and contribute to its economic development. During the first half of the 20th century, rural vocational education was dominated by courses in vocational agriculture and home  economics. Later, rural school systems responded by building regional vocational education centers to deliver new types of training. Today's rural schools must overcome such problems as lack of cooperation and sharing among districts, diminishing resources, and changing technology and market demands. A potential solution to the problem of the declining economic base of rural communities is more collaborative activities. Rural vocational education must be able to develop programs responsive to the needs of the types of industries in their immediate areas. (MN)",

The culture dimensions measured in the survey included job evaluation/job satisfaction, work efficiency, training and development, communication, management effectiveness, and view of the organization. Company-wide average ratings on each of the six dimensions were all very close to the 2.5 midpoint of the 1-to-4 point rating scale and had very small differences. Of these differences, the most positive (2.73) average rating was the view of the organization, and the area needing the most attention (2.43) was training and development. Although there was no clear-cut employee  perception of excellence and satisfaction, there was also no clear-cut perception of disarray or dissatisfaction. Of the 60 items on the survey, only 7 agreement items reached or exceeded the 3.0 clear point of agreement and only 2 disagreement items reached the 1.0 point (2.0 was a clear point of disagreement). Average employees wanted to work for AMSCO and felt that they and their departments were important. Unfortunately, results indicated that an AMSCO grapevine existed that carried false information. Data is illustrated in numerous bar charts and the survey instrument is included. (YLB)",

The study examined how successful adult readers make decisions about why, when, and how to use reading on the job. It also identified unique aspects of the job reading context that both require workers to control their reading efficiently and productively and help them to do so. These included the role of workers' job experience as an aid in reading, readers' perceptions of what makes text difficult or easy to use, and the availability and use of sources of information other than print. Suggestions were made for incorporating metacongition training into job training programs to help adult readers make the most effective use of their work environments. Specific  recommendations were that (1) job-related reading instruction needs to teach workers to be aware of the interaction of factors that work together to influence reading success; (2) because of the importance of efficiency and productivity on the job, workers need to develop personal strategies for effective use of reading; (3) those who generate materials to be read on the job must consider how, when, and where these materials are used; and (4) job training should include direct experience with and instruction in the specific materials and reading tasks encountered in the job.

Major objectives of appraising employee performance were individual development, individual performance, wage and salary actions, assessment of training and development needs, and selection for promotion. Ninety percent reported that employer  appraisals were conducted only by immediate supervisors. Approximately 85 percent indicated that they conduct formal appraisals only on an annual basis. All indicated that their formal appraisals were conducted in writing and were retained with the employees' personal records, which were accessible to all applicable supervisors and the appraised individual. Most used general experience to verify the reliability and validity of appraisal mechanisms. Most reported that federal regulations regarding nondiscriminatory personnel practices and individual rights to privacy have not caused firms to change prior practices in obtaining and using performance appraisal information.

There are three major areas for the research agenda. The first two have to do with the national trends in external agencies that affect campus governance, management, and finance and internal campus trends in these same three areas. The third area is to examine theories of organization that are relevant to higher education research and practice, specifically integrating management and governance theory and differential pricing. Postsecondary vocational educators must be concerned about the following trends if they are to give effective leadership in the future: reduced federal and state funding for vocational  education and all of the impacts of reduced funding; partnership building between secondary institutions and industry (including labor); collaboration and joint programming among postsecondary institutions; and focused state strategies and plans for addressing industry-specific training. The Ohio model in postsecondary vocational and technical opportunities is one of the finest in that it forces a local understanding of economic development and the needs of business and industry as a requisite for participation in strategy formulation and program delivery.

        "description":"At the same time that it is experiencing rapid growth, the field of adult education is struggling with its own maturation and development as a profession. One of the issues related to the professionalization of the adult education field is that of certification. Those who favor professional certification argue that it is a means to develop the profession because it is a practice that separates individual practitioners who are competent from those who are not. Those who argue against professional certification do so for a wide variety of reasons. Some believe that the certification process is incompatible with the philosophical assumptions underlying the field, whereas others feel that certification might divide an already fragmented field. Areas of discussion related to  certification focus on (1) the major proficiencies needed by effective adult education practitioners; (2) the relationship of the proficiencies to performance and program quality; (3) appropriate determination and measurement of the proficiencies; and (4) the purpose of certification. Another controversy surrounds the determination of an appropriate credential and credentialing body. (A 32-item list of print resources and resource organizations is included.) (MN)",

        "description":"Debate continues about the appropriate role for vocational education at the secondary level. The many educational reform reports issued during the early to mid-1980s initiated a reexamination of the role of secondary vocational education. As a result of the reform reports, high school graduation requirements in academic areas have increased, and the amount of time left for vocational education courses has been reduced. The amount and type of vocational courses needed has become an issue, with one faction calling for increased academic requirements for noncollege-bound youth and the other calling for increased job-specific training to prepare noncollege-bound youth for entry into the work force. The increasing numbers of at-risk youth have intensified this debate because secondary  vocational education programs can provide an avenue to a productive life for many members of at-risk populations. Proponents who argue that vocational education should focus on general employability believe that specific skill training is best left to employers. Opponents to a focus on general employability training argue that high school may be the only opportunity for many youths to acquire job training.

Almost all of the net increase of 21 million jobs between 1986 and 2000 will be in the service-producing sector. The increases in the services sector bode well for the future of working women, because women have dominated many of the industries where growth is expected to be greatest. Women have made great strides in obtaining jobs that require postsecondary education and/or  skills training. Eleven occupations are projected to increase by more than 400,000 jobs in the year 2000, and women held more than 80 percent of those jobs in six occupational categories in 1986.

However, much of the untold story about illiteracy is about people with power who are choosing not to wield it--educators, economists, elected officials, presidential candidates, corporate leaders, publishers, and the literate public at large--in support of changing poverty-related illiteracy. Reporting on illiteracy and other poverty issues requires immersion, context, and repetition. The first step in reporting on illiteracy is defining the problem and isolating its causes. It requires asking why and making connections. Finally, good reporting on illiteracy requires comparisons that get attention, objectivity, and the search for tidal facts, the facts that  illuminate the essential truths of the situation. (KC)",

Many agencies in California used the Employability Competency System Appraisal Test to assess 1987 SYET participants' basic reading and math skills. Between June and October 1987, the test was administered to 10,003 SYET enrollees in California. Slightly less than half of those taking the test were female, with Hispanics accounting for 43.9 percent, Blacks for 22.9 percent, Asians for 15.7 percent, and Whites for 10.8 percent. English was the native language of 59.6 percent of those tested, with 22.6 percent of the youths listing Spanish as their native language. Thirty-one percent had completed high school, and  49.9 percent had completed the 9th or 10th grade. Nearly 11 percent of the SYET enrollees needed both math and reading remediation, 19.4 percent needed only math remediation, 2.9 percent needed only reading remediation. It was determined that an additional 32.4 percent would benefit from some remediation (that is, they functioned at or above a seventh-grade level but below a high school entry level), leaving 34.4 percent who functioned at or above the high school entry level.

The Brief then provides guidelines for effective use of CAI in adult literacy instruction. They include familiarizing all instructional  staff with the CAI aspects of the literacy program; providing sufficient demonstration time and enough individual personal assistance for students to feel comfortable using computers; providing training and inservice opportunities for instructional staff; using only software appropriate for adult learners; not thinking of the computer only as a tool for individual use; providing for flexible scheduling of microcomputer use; not depending on the computer to be the sole source of instructional support; and providing opportunities for students to develop occupational skills through CAI.

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship between the stressfulness of each state's social environment, smoking, and mortality rates for respiratory cancer. It was based on a health behavior model which assumed that under conditions of high stress some people fail to exercise normal prudence in either protecting their health or engage in practices inimical to health. Two types of social stress were conceptualized and measured at the state level: one based on life changes requiring adaptation and measured by an index in which negative personal life events in 15 categories were aggregated for each state using macro measures, the second based on the idea of chronic stressful conditions and measured through the Measure of Status Integration. Smoking was measured by tobacco sales and  by a survey of percent smoking by state. Both stressful events and stressful conditions were correlated with all indicators of smoking at the state level, 12 of 14 correlations being in the theoretically expected direction. Correlations were enhanced when age, urbanicity, the percentage of blacks, education, and low income were controlled. The data were compatible with a causal model suggesting that socially generated stress in states increases the level of smoking behavior which in turn soon leads to higher death rates for cancer of the respiratory system. Although stress and smoking have been previously linked at the individual level and the smoking/cancer link has long been established, this study appears to be the first to link living in stressful geographic locales with the increased  health risk of respiratory cancer.

This study tested exchange theory and resource theory, examining the possibility that not only lower status husbands, but also husbands of higher status, may be influenced toward aggression by status discrepancies with their wives. It is based on data drawn from a cross-sectional national sample of 2,143 American couples in 1976. Questionnaires were completed through interviews with 960 men and 1,183 women. Characteristics measured were husband-to-wife violence, socioeconomic status, status discrepancies between spouses, marital power, status concern, and background variables. The sample had 1,839 couples reporting no violence and 250 couples reporting  violence in the past year. The relationship between husband's occupational prestige and husband-to-wife violence was found to vary according to the wife's occupational prestige. When the wife's status was low, she had a relatively high probability of being assaulted regardless of the husband's prestige; and while high prestige wives had a lower risk of abuse overall, the chances of high status wives being victimized increased as their husbands' status decreased. The finding that a husband's prestige was not related to violence when the wife's prestige was low but was negatively related when the wife's prestige was high suggests that the effect of the husband's occupational prestige on violence depends on the wife's prestige.

Data were obtained by telephone interviews in 1985 with a national probability sample of 6,002 households. The wife abuse data came from wives' reports in 3,665 households containing a currently married or cohabiting couple. Survey questions measured drunkenness and drug abuse, violence, and approval of violence. The sample was classified into three groups: non-abused wives, women who experienced minor violence at the hands of their partner, and women who were the victims of severe assaults by their partner. Discriminant analysis was used to  determine the extent to which these groups could be differentiated on the basis of 11 variables: (1) wife's drug use; (2) wife's drunkenness; (3) husband's drug use; (4) husband's drunkenness; (5) low income; (6) violence by victim's parents; (7) housewife status; (8) husband's unemployment; (9) pregnancy; (10) violence norms; and (11) number of children. The results revealed that, relative to other factors examined, husband's drug use was the most important predictor of wife abuse, and husband's drunkenness was second in importance. Women who drank heavily or used other drugs had a higher risk of being victims of wife abuse than did other women. Other important factors were low income, unemployment, and attitudes which tolerate violence. (NB)",

        "description":"This study examined the relationship of the age and gender of the child, and the occupational status and gender of the parent, to the incidence and frequency of physical punishment and two levels of physical abuse of children, as measured by the minor, severe, and very severe violence indexes of the Conflict Tactics Scales. The subjects were children from a nationally representative sample of 3,229 families. Physical punishment was found to peak at ages 3 and 4, being used by 90% of the parents, and to decrease steadily after age 4. More than one-half of all parents were reported to still use physical punishment with their children who were 13 years of age. No age trend was found for very severe violence. Parents who used any level of violence tended to do so repeatedly. Boys  were the victims more often than were girls, and more blue-collar parents than white-collar parents engaged in both minor and severe violence. These effects were found to be stronger for severe violence. Mothers used minor violence more often than did fathers. Only one significant interaction effect was found: for very severe violence, of the abused children in this sample, repetition of the abuse tended to be greatest when the victim was a girl and the perpetrator was a white-collar father. Several explanations, particularly social norms, are used to interpret findings. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"This study tested the learned helplessness theory, stress theory, and a modified stress theory to determine the best model for predicting the probability that a woman would seek help when she experienced severe violence from a male partner. The probability was hypothesized to increase as the stress of the violence experienced increased. Data were obtained from a national probability sample of 3,665 married or cohabiting women. Subjects responded to the Decision to Seek Help measure, the Conflict Tactics Scale to measure violence by the male partner, and several modifying resources and characteristics. Data analysis revealed no evidence to indicate the presence of learned helplessness among the battered women in the sample. Sixty-eight percent of the women who had experienced  severe violence sought help one or more times for personal problems and the predicted probability of seeking help for high levels of severe violence was .77. While age, education, occupation, fear of being hit, having parents who hit each other, and depression were all found to influence the probability of seeking help, the amount of severe violence experienced was the primary factor in the woman's decision to seek help. A stress model of help-seeking was supported by the data. The findings suggest a needed change in the image of the battered woman from weak and passive to active and help-seeking. Appendixes include indexes for help-seeking, severe violence, and depression; provided also are four data tables and eight figures. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"This study compared the rate of physical abuse of children from a 1975 study with the rates from a 1985 replication study. Both studies used nationally representative samples (2,143 families in 1975 and 3,520 families in 1985), and both found an extremely high incidence of physical assaults against children which were severe enough to constitute child abuse. Although the 1985 rates were high, they were substantially lower than the 1975 rates. There was a 47% decrease in physical child abuse reported from 1975 to 1985. Possible reasons for the decrease include: (1) differences in the methods of the studies; (2) increased reluctance to report incidents of child abuse; (3) reductions in intra-family violence due to 10 years of intensive prevention and treatment efforts; and (4)  reductions due to changes in American society and family patterns which would have produced lower rates of intra-family violence even without ameliorative programs. Most likely the findings represent a combination of changed attitudes and norms, and changes in overt behavior. This interpretation is based on changes in American society in the areas of the family, the economy, the social acceptability of family violence, alternatives available to women, social control processes, and the availability of treatment and prevention services. (Policy implications of the decreases and of the continued high rate of child abuse, are discussed.) (Author/NB)",

        "description":"In this decade, the pervasiveness of wife abuse across all segments of society has become more evident to the public, leading to a redefinition of it as criminal. This social change, based on the collective response of feminists, battered women's advocates, and legislators, has altered laws on family violence in some 43 states. While new laws appear to have forced a more vigorous response to wife abuse cases by criminal justice system members, new legislation per se has not changed the system's response. Problems persist in the criminal justice system response to wife abuse, and there is difficulty in implementing new laws, in enforcing protective orders, and in categorizing domestic violence as criminal even though a possible consequence is death to a spouse. This paper uses the  theoretical framework developed by Freeman (1975) to describe social change to show how the organized efforts of Illinois feminist attorneys and battered women's advocates changed state law and the structure of the Cook County First Municipal District Court. A social control perspective delineated by Madoo Lengerman, and Wallace (1985) is used to analyze data obtained from an evaluation of the Chicago court. (NB)",

        "description":"Recent panel studies of deterrence have reported little evidence that perceptions of legal sanctions promote deterrence. Yet those studies have consistently found that extralegal sanctions &quot;inhibit&quot; criminal involvement. Conclusions drawn from this line of research remain speculative, however, because they are guided by an unnecessarily narrow conception of deterrence, the distinction between legal and extralegal sanctions is unclear, and the analyses conducted gloss over some potentially relevant measurement distinctions. To address these issues, data from one wave of an ongoing national panel study of assaults between adult partners were used to assess the perceived costs associated with the perpetration of assaultive action and the perceived costs associated with being  sanctioned (i.e., arrested) for such action. Based on results of the study, it was proposed that the costs seen as flowing from arrest, identified as attachment loss, social stigma, and self-stigma, should be considered part of the deterrence process. Judgments about how engaging in some illegal act might create costs in these three areas for perpetrators are seen as extralegal sources of control, not as part of deterrence. Future research might attempt to assess the controlling power of costs associated with actual and potential arrest for a variety of illegal acts. (Fourteen endnotes are included.) (Author/NB)",

        "description":"There are many studies of violence in marriage and in dating. Methodological differences between studies, however, make it difficult to determine differences in the nature and extent of physical assault between marital status groups. This study analyzed data from two surveys: a study of 526 dating couples at a large midwestern university, and a study of a national probability sample of 5,005 married and 237 cohabiting couples. The results showed that cohabiting couples had a higher rate of assault than did married couples. These findings persisted after controls for age and socioeconomic status were introduced. Violence was also more severe in cohabiting than in married or dating couples. A number of factors may account for the more frequent violence in cohabiting relationships.  These include social isolation, the publicity given to wife-beating by the women's movement, questions of autonomy and control, and the investment in the relationship. When age was controlled, dating couples had the lowest violence rate of the three marital status groups. The fact that those who date generally are in a less serious/committed relationship as compared to those who cohabit or are married, may explain the lower rate of dating violence. (Author)",

        "description":"Decision Support Systems (DSSs) are computer-based decision aids to use when making decisions which are partially amenable to rational decision-making procedures but contain elements where intuitive judgment is an essential component. In such situations, DSSs are used to improve the quality of decision-making. The DSS approach is based on Simon's (1960) bounded rationality model of decision-making. Replacing that model with a more detailed model of decision-making would increase the usefulness of DSSs. Janis and Mann's (1978) conflict theory of decision-making sees most significant decisions to be somewhat stressful. The challenge of a threat or an opportunity starts a decision-making process in which four questions are asked, resulting in the possibility of five basic outcomes:  (1) unconflicted adherence, in which the person determines that the best course of action is to do nothing; (2) unconflicted change, in which the most immediately available alternative is selected without further consideration; (3) defensive avoidance, in which the problem is ignored; (4) hypervigilance, in which panic sets in; and (5) vigilance, in which a full and effective search of the alternatives can be made. The model also contains a Decisional Balance Sheet with which to evaluate decisions. This model of decision-making should enable the decision support model to be extended in a way which suggests new approaches to using computers as decision aids, especially in the area of career guidance.

Implementation of the project, which began with the creation of a pilot program in the fall of 1985, is reviewed and changes and improvements made since the pilot program are discussed. A section on programming describes the three major programming components of instruction, community activities, and student  involvement opportunities. Under the component of instruction, two courses currently offered as part of the HDC project are described: a basic course for residents or participants within the developmental community and a special course for student leaders within the project. The component of community activities lists three activities: (1) periodic large group meetings of all community members; (2) a special \"Wellness Fair\"; and (3) service projects. The ongoing assessment and evaluation of the project is discussed.

Research findings suggest that sexuality educators and adolescents themselves are divided on the issue. The current political climate suggests that educators should promote abstinence. Some programs concentrate on the negative aspects of intercourse for adolescents, such as pregnancy, premature parenthood, venereal disease, abandonment by the loved one, and loss of self-respect, but do not offer alternatives. Abstinence programs which avoid the mention of contraception reinforce a reluctance to plan, to take responsibility for one's behavior, or to use contraception. Planned Parenthood should teach abstinence from intercourse within  the context of sexuality education, not instead of such comprehensive education. Planned Parenthood has always presented abstinence as one contraceptive option, but only one of many options, and has asserted that informed choice is critical. Individuals have the right to have access to information about family planning. Schools, school systems, and states should work to implement the provision of sexuality education for all students, and to assure that contraceptive services are accessible to young people. (NB)",

The first chapter reviews results of empirical studies which addressed the question of how the parent-adolescent relationship contributes to the successful transition of adolescents into adult society. The review is grounded in studies of parent-adolescent relationships in well-functioning families of middle socioeconomic status. The results are then used as the framework for assessing other factors which bear on contemporary youths' transition into adulthood. The second chapter discusses divorce and its effects on such areas as family income, parent-adolescent relationships, stepparents, educational achievement, psychosocial well-being, heterosexual relationships, and maternal employment.  The third chapter discusses career development from a framework based on three sets of factors which are important for work and career development, i.e., psychological factors, social-structural factors, and family factors. The final chapter reviews studies regarding peer relationships with regard to the question of whether they counter or extend parent-adolescent relationships. The popular view of a unitary youth culture with separate values from adult culture is rejected. This chapter contends that the friendships children establish are healthy and need not be competitive in terms of affection or value orientation. The conclusions section discusses factors that either undermine or support the mutuality of adolescent-parent relationships that assists youth in passing on the worthwhile  traditions of the social order.

        "description":"Although no specific personality disorder seems responsible for suicide behavior, it has been suggested that hysterical personality could predispose to suicide behavior. Schizoid, anti-social and obsessoid rigid personalities have been linked to high risk suicide attempts. This study elicited response patterns and attitudes of South African university students (N=283) to hypothetical stressful situations. Suicidal psychiatric patients (N=60) who had recovered from a current episode of mental illness served as controls. All subjects completed questionnaires consisting of seven attitude scales: (1) attitude to self; (2) attitude to life; (3) attitude to the world; (4) stress reaction; (5) happiness scale; (6) passive death wishes; and (7) active death wishes. The results revealed  that 32% of the students and 56% of the patients would be inclined to suicide or the passive acceptance of death under stressful circumstances. Forty-eight percent of the students and 46% of the patients reported having attempted suicide. Twenty-two percent of the students and 30% of the patients thought future suicidal behavior was likely. Several target attitudes were identified as markers of possible future suicidal acts. Subjects identified as high-risk thought they had insufficient achievement in life, felt they should not have been born, considered themselves not understood or appreciated by their family, found death too far away, and had nervous reactions to stress with agitation and confusion.

        "description":"Recent research has demonstrated that spatial memory in young and elderly adults depends upon the context in which items to be remembered are placed. Contexts in which cues to location are distinctive and heterogeneous have been found to be associated with better object location memory for both age groups. In this study, the relative contributions of contextual visual distinctiveness at encoding and at retrieval to this effect were assessed. In an earlier study, contexts were identified that either maximized spacial memory performance (e.g., a room with highly distinctive furnishings) or minimized it (e.g., a schematic black-and-white scale map of that room). Since it has been previously demonstrated that one context (the map) hindered spatial memory while the other (the room)  aided performance for both age groups, it was possible to estimate the relative importance of encoding and retrieval for successful recall by comparing results of these conditions. Subjects included 24 young adults and 24 active, healthy elderly adults; there were no significant differences in occupational or educational background of respondents. Conditions at encoding were found to be of greater importance to the spatial memory performance of both age groups than were conditions at retrieval. A second experiment using 12 young and 12 elderly adults demonstrated that respondents of both ages tended to encode object locations more effectively than they did the associations of specific locations with specific stimulus objects.

Printed materials from the organization suggested that \"caring\" and \"life enrichment\" were among its priorities. Program coordinators built on the group members' feelings of  solidarity by encouraging them, through applause and cheering, and by directing each meeting to minimize conflict and confusion. Two enthusiastic adult group members assisted the coordinators.

        "description":"Staff and residents of settings for the aged often hold substantially different views of their shared environment, and the literature suggests that these perceptual discrepancies transcend such factors as degree of institutional totality, quality of care, and differences in personal characteristics among staff and residents. Despite the pervasiveness of staff-resident perceptual discrepancies, there has been virtually no effort toward understanding either their theoretical or applied significance. From a review of the literature on staff-resident perceptual discrepancies in long-term care settings several conclusions emerge. First, it appears evident that status as either staff or resident is more predictive of environmental perceptions than are other relevant personal  characteristics, except for, perhaps, age of residents. Secondly, staff-resident perceptual discrepancies appear to become more pronounced as one shifts from concrete dimensions, such as the physical or organizational characteristics of environments, to more abstract dimensions such as emotionality or degree of resident control. There is also a dearth of information regarding the consequences and behavioral correlates of staff-resident perceptual discrepancies. Finally, the bulk of the research in this area has been descriptive and atheoretical in nature. Further understanding of the implications of this perceptual incongruence will be restricted until adequate theoretical models are developed. (ABL)",

The short form was administered to 104 elderly patients, 48 of whom had probable Alzheimer's disease, with the additional 56 meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III criteria for major depression. Statistically significant differences were found between the Alzheimer's  disease and depressed group on all 10 clinical scales included in the short form. The depressed group produced a completely normal profile when the critical level age and education adjustment procedure was applied. A discriminant analysis correctly classified 81.7% of the cases, with an estimated cross-validation correct classification rate of 75%.

        "description":"Typically, neuropsychological assessment has been used to predict various diagnostic parameters. In the elderly, referrals are often made to psychologists for the purpose of facilitating diagnosis of psychiatric or organic conditions, such as depression or Alzheimer's disease. However, psychologists are routinely requested to make recommendations about patients' functional capacity for the purpose of aftercare planning. This study examined the relationship between various neuropsychological skills and ability to perform a number of instrumental daily living tasks in a sample of 98 elderly inpatients of a geriatric psychiatry ward. When activities of daily living (ADL) items were grouped according to categories of personal self-care, mobility, and independent self-care,  significant relationships were noted between cognitive-based ADL functions and neuropsychological test performance. Results suggest the potential utility of neuropsychological tests for prediction of functional outcome and for examining models of neuropsychological skills required for various daily living requirements. Results also suggest that neuropsychological test performance is unlikely to be useful in predicting basic self-care and mobility functions. These findings may be of value in future research designed to evaluate the predictive efficacy of clinical neuropsychological evaluations in determining functional outcomes with hospitalized elderly patients.

This study examined individual's self-set goals, certainty, and task performance of two work periods in a group setting as a function of Type A behavior pattern and task labels (difficult versus easy). Subjects (N=115) were students in an undergraduate psychology course. Subjects were divided into three groups (Type A, intermediate, Type B) according to a three-split of their Type A scores. An identical anagram-solving task was labeled either as a difficult task or as an easy task. Results showed that in the first work period subjects in the easy condition set higher goals than did  those in the difficult condition. Type A's showed a higher level of certainty of goal accomplishment than did intermediates and Type B's. No significant performance differences were found in the first work period. In the second work period, Type A's in the easy condition set significantly higher goals than did Type B's. Intermediates in the easy condition set higher goals than did those in the difficult condition. Type A's' goal setting in the second period was not affected by the task labels. Subjects in the difficult condition were more certain in their goal accomplishment than were those in the easy condition. Again no significant performance differences were found in that period.

        "description":"Dual wage families are becoming the norm. Increased maternal participation in the workplace has transformed the lives of families and these dramatic changes have created an urgent need for strategies to assist families with two working parents. Most individuals pursuing this lifestyle are eager to learn how to cope more effectively with various common sources of conflict. Helping these families requires an understanding of their conflicts and stressors, and the application of appropriately conceived interventions. Four factors have been found to characterize successful dual earner couples. These couple-attitudes are commitment to an egalitarian lifestyle; assumption of a high degree of personal responsibility and recognition of choices; self-perception as generally competent; and  demonstration of a high degree of mutual trust and respect. An intervention which has been successfully used with a diverse group of dual wage family members focuses on building stress-resistance strategies by building an orientation of hardiness. In the 1980s it seems that more couples would like a more truly egalitarian lifestyle, one in which both husband and wife, each equally committed to family and work, aspire to integrate their two roles as parent and worker and to view family and work as complementary, rather than adversarial segments of life experience.

Data to test the proposed model were collected through semi-structured interviews and standardized questionnaires with 490 widows and widowers at 6 weeks (T1), 6 months (T2), 12 months (T3), 18 months (T4), and 24 months (T5) following the loss of the spouse. A linear structural equation approach using the statistical program LISREL was  employed in the analysis of data. A model was estimated with an adequate fit for T1, T2, and T3, but not for T4 or T5. There was no evidence for a direct effect of social support on the well-being of the bereaved. In examining the indirect effects of social support, parameter estimates were consistent with the premise that social support enhances coping behaviors which, in turn foster well-being (as evidenced by diminished illness symptomatology). Perceived stress also had a direct positive effect on illness symptomatology. (Six figures and 25 references are included.) (Author)",

Psychologists in increasing numbers work in hospital and hospice settings, and therapists treat terminally ill patients and/or their families. Greater attention is being paid to the needs and rights of these patients and families, especially the rights of privacy, self-determination, and informed consent. This paper raises questions which must be faced in dealing with ethical dilemmas that arise over conflicting rights and needs in the area of informed consent. It also provides a decision-making model for working through such dilemmas. The model presented contains the five stages of recognizing the conflict, structuring the conflict, deciding on an action after  considering all the alternatives and their implications, carrying out the decision or action, and assessing the results. The model is used in an analysis of the ethical dilemma involved in the dying patient's right to give informed consent. Procedures used by a hospice team are discussed as a sample of the decision-making process. (Thirty-five references are listed.) (Author/NB)",

This study was conducted to: (1) describe the nature of maltreatment among runaway and homeless youth; (2) provide a profile of their family and demographic characteristics; (3) examine how maltreated runaway and homeless youth differ from the runaway and homeless youth population at large; and (4) present behavioral indicators of adolescent maltreatment to assist with the uncovering of maltreatment among troubled youth. Data were derived from the Statewide Teamwork for Abused Runaways (STAR) project, a federal research and demonstration project designed to strengthen services to runaway and homeless youth and their families. Subjects  included 223 abused and neglected youth who sought services from nine runaway and homeless youth programs in New York. A questionnaire on the nature of maltreatment, youth and family characteristics, and the runaway program's experience with child protective services, and the Youth Information Form were completed by project staff when services were terminated. Youth were not directly interviewed with the instruments. The results revealed that, compared to runaways and homeless youth in general, the maltreated sample had a higher percentage of females, and a higher percentage of Black and Hispanic program users. Maltreatment was the primary reason most of the maltreated subjects sought help from the project. The results of the study affirm the importance of identifying maltreatment among  runaway and homeless youth. (Thirty-five references are provided.) (NB)",

A survey of 208 school psychology training programs was conducted to obtain information about trainers' perceptions of significant problems influencing the practice of school psychology, required coursework and educational experiences, and recruitment strategies. Responding program directors (N=139) cited an overemphasis on assessment, resulting in limited opportunity to engage in consultation and cognitive/behavioral interventions as the most serious problem influencing the practice of school psychology. Poor working conditions such as low salaries, inadequate resources, and lack of respect for professional skills was the second most frequently  cited problem. The need for a more professional working environment was stressed. Program directors rank ordered the five most important academic and training experiences, in order of importance, to be psychodiagnostic assessment, consultation, internship, practicum, and cognitive and/or behavioral interventions. Another significant finding was that brochures were perceived as the most successful recruitment strategy while trips to other colleges and universities received the lowest rating. These findings have implications for how school psychology graduate programs could most effectively spend their limited recruitment funds. (NB)",

There is considerable evidence that decisions about institutionalization are usually stressful and difficult for family members. This study obtained qualitative and quantitative data from two studies conducted at the Margaret Blenkner Research Center of the Benjamin Rose Institute to illustrate six ethical issues involved in family caregiving and institutionalization. The first study involved a survey of 614 family members living with and caring for an impaired elderly spouse or parent and a follow-up study 4 years later with 146 of the original families, 35 of whom had institutionalized the elder during that time. The second study was a 6-year panel study of family  decision making and caregiving which involved 400 caregiving families, 32 of whom had institutionalized an elderly parent. Combining both studies, 67 families were interviewed before and after the elder's institutionalization. Results of the interviews revealed dilemmas arising because of: (1) difficulties inherent in defining what is best for the individual elder; (2) problems in delineating caregivers' responsibilities toward the parent or spouse; (3) conflicts of interest or competing obligations; (4) policies, services, and reimbursement mechanisms for long-term care; (5) tension between such values as autonomy and paternalism; (6) different perceptions among caregivers; and (7) the quality of family relationships.

        "description":"This study compared the functional disability levels of participants in adult day centers with patients in intermediate care facilities (ICFs). A three-page questionnaire measuring demographics, social resources, physical health, mental health, and activities of daily living as assessed by the Activities of Daily Living scale and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale was administered by trained staff at all 15 of Hawaii's adult day centers and at 22 of Hawaii's 26 ICFs. The final sample (N=824) consisted of 462 ICF patients, 67 Adult Day Health (ADH) participants, and 295 Adult Day Care (ADC) participants. The results revealed significant differences among the three subgroups in functional status while similarities existed in medical diagnoses and demographic  characteristics. The demographic makeup of the ADC and ICF groups was similar for mean age, percent female, and incidence of medical diagnoses. The two groups differed in that the ADC group was healthier, more independent, and more involved in social activities that was the ICF group. The degree of family support of ADC participants was significantly higher than for ICF patients. The ADH participants, compared to ICP and ADC participants, were younger, equally likely to be male or female, and had the shortest length of stay in the program. The findings suggest that the availability of family and informal support is an important factor in the use of adult day centers. Appendixes include the functional disability questionnaire and four data tables. (NB)",

Of particular interest to both clinicians and researchers would be a study focusing on changes in the patient's cognitive and behavioral abilities over time. This study measured the changes in cognitive and behavioral abilities displayed by Alzheimer's disease patients over a period of 6 months. Data were collected as part of a large-scale, ongoing longitudinal research project. Subjects were 5 males and 11 females meeting criteria for probable AD. The mean age of the sample ws 76.4 years and the average level of education was 12.4 years. The cognitive  tests used included the Mental Status Questionnaire, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Information-Memory-Concentration test. The behavioral tests used included the Memory/Behavior Problem Checklist (MBPC) and a scale designed to assess the patient's ability to carry out activities of daily living. Subjects were tested at two points in time separated by approximately 6 months. Caregivers also completed measures of behavioral impairment. Results showed all measures except the MBPC were able to discriminate changes in patient abilities. The patients' cognitive scores at the first testing were predictive of their level of behavioral impairment at the second testing. The rate of decline for individuals was not subject to substantial fluctuation. (ABL)",

        "description":"This document notes that the literature addressing children's nuclear fears suggests that children are introduced to the nuclear threat by ways that do not provide dialogue and without regard to the age appropriate needs of the child, and that parents seem to be protecting their children from the horror of a holocaust by not talking about the threat, thereby creating a communication barrier between the generations. It presents material designed to encourage parents to discuss nuclear issues with their children. Ten myths about children's nuclear fears are listed. These myths include the following: (1) a child's fear of nuclear war is not normal; (2) children feel free to talk about what is bothering them; (3) children believe that nuclear war is preventable; (4) children know  what their parents think about nuclear war; (5) children are aware that many people are working to prevent nuclear war; (6) American children are better informed than children in the Soviet Union; (7) children get most of their information from the schools; (8) children who worry about nuclear war must be worriers about everything; (9) children are too young to be so worried and afraid of nuclear war; and (10) nuclear fears are best handled by experts. The importance of the process of parents encouraging children to express their concerns and ventilate their fears is described. It is concluded that reducing children's fears is not a political issue, but rather a parental one which does not entail the necessity for a belief in either nuclear disarmament or proliferation.

It discusses weekly program meetings, staff recruitment and training, program monitoring, and program evaluation. Evaluation results are presented which showing that low- and moderate-risk student-athletes who  participated in the program had a higher mean grade point average (GPA) at the end of their first quarter than did student-athletes in the same two risk categories who did not participate in the program, while borderline and high-risk student-athlete program participants had a lower mean GPA than did borderline and high-risk nonparticipants. Program evaluation findings are reported, after 3 years of program operation, which suggest that traditional study skills alone do not adequately address the needs of student-athletes. The evaluation concludes that program planners must know the academic background of the target population and must incorporate flexibility into the basic program design.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of an instructional design procedure developed to reduce examiner scoring errors on the WISC-R. Data concerning frequent sources of error on the WISC-R were obtained from 14 clinical psychology graduate students (pre-intervention group) enrolled in an Individual Intelligence Testing course. Remedial strategies were developed to clarify response categories and minimize errors due to carelessness. Strategies were used with 9 post-intervention students who took the course the following fall term. Pre- and post-intervention students completed the course and administered the  WISC-R several times. A total of 98 pre-intervention and 63 post-intervention protocols were analyzed to determine the number and type of errors. Compared to the pre-intervention group, the post-intervention group had significantly fewer errors, with careless mathematical and clerical mistakes almost eliminated. Students continued to make mistakes, showing no improvement with practice in test administrations. A certain amount of difficulty in scoring may be inherent in the WISC-R test manual, and it may be advisable to incorporate examiner scoring errors into the WISC-R standard error of measurement.

        "description":"There have been assumptions in the literature that sexuality education programs can increase adolescents' knowledge, help them clarify values, and improve decision making and communication skills; and that these changes, in turn, can reduce irresponsible sexual activity, unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, some sexual dysfunctions, and can improve interpersonal relationships and self-perception. This study examined the relation between a comprehensive sexuality health education course and the self-perception of adolescents. Subjects were high school students who took either the self-esteem portion of a health class during the first 9 weeks of the first semester (N=104), students who took the reproductive knowledge portion of the class first (N=92), and a  control group who took the health class second semester (N=86). Subjects completed the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents and a teacher-made test of general reproductive knowledge as pretests, posttest, and delayed posttests. The results showed that students' level of reproductive knowledge was increased by taking the health class, but that students retained only 50% of that knowledge 9 weeks after taking the class. Analysis of the Self-Perception Profile posttest scores revealed no significant differences between groups. Changes in self-perception among students taking the self-esteem portion of the class were statistically insignificant. The survey instrument is appended. (NB)",

This study addressed the interplay between environmental events, personal attempts to cope with the demands of those events, and the effect that environmental demand and personal coping have on a school principal's perception of stress. Elementary and secondary school principals (N=429) in Alberta, Canada completed a survey measuring demographic information; fluctuations in stress levels over the school year and the reciprocal influences between job and nonjob stressors; the procedures principals used to control stress; and the relationship between demands, perceived coping effectiveness, and stress for both job  and nonjob demands. The results revealed that the principals considered their jobs to be moderately stressful, with stress levels varying throughout the school year. Stress levels were reported to be higher in job settings than in nonjob settings. Most principals reported using few skills that have been demonstrated to be successful for controlling stress. The positive relationship found between demand and stress, coupled with the negative relationship found between stress and perceived coping effectiveness, suggests that people who perceive themselves as coping effectively with the demands they face generally are not very stressed.

This study was conducted to develop and field test a procedure for depicting change in cognitive structure across time and to investigate the relationship between changes in cognitive structure and counseling skill. Seven first year students in a masters level counselor education program participated in the study during a 13-week practicum course. All students had completed a course in counseling theory and a course in counseling skills and strategies prior to enrolling in the practicum. Assessments were made during the first week in which students were seeing clients and during the last 3 weeks of the practicum. Assessment procedures included a  procedure developed to provide a descriptive analysis of the skills that counselors used in interactions with clients, and a cognitive mapping task designed to assess counselor conceptualizations of how clients changed in counseling. The cognitive mapping task did provide evidence of change in the cognitive structure of the students during their practicum experiences. The purpose of the investigation was to field test the methodology. Based on the data obtained, the cognitive mapping task and the skill coding and analysis procedures appeared to have useful applications to both counselor education and to counseling research. (NB)",

Teaching courses is described as one area where student affairs staff directly contribute to the academic mission. While there are many subject areas that could be taught by student affairs personnel, some particularly relevant ones are considered, such as courses dealing with college students, leadership, training, community development, higher  education, and finance and administration. This report elaborates and illustrates the role of student affairs personnel in academic functions by discussing the teaching of a course entitled \"Education and Racism.\" It concludes that there are unique contributions that can be made by student affairs personnel that directly affect academic functions which are not being made by others on campus, asserting that an attempt should be made to redefine and develop the academic role for student affairs staff and calling for a future conference on the topic.

While some recent studies have begun to examine the academic and career needs of international students, most of these studies did not directly compare the needs of international students to those of American students. This study was conducted to assess career and academic needs of incoming international students (N=215) and to compare those needs to needs of United States students (N=1,002). Two general patterns emerged from the results. First, international students expressed greater academic and career needs than did American students. Second, the rank-ordering of relative importance of the needs differed between the two groups. Job seeking  skills and exploring job opportunities were ranked as relatively more important to American students than they were to international students. International students ranked the need to learn how to prepare a career and the need to see a counselor about career plans as relatively more important than did students from the United States. These findings suggest implications for counseling programs designed to help international students. (Author/NB)",

Operating in sites in Manhattan and Queens, New York, the program served 294 second to sixth grade students during the 1986-1987 school year. Students who scored poorly on the Degrees of Reading Power Test or the Metropolitan Achievement Test, many of whom came from troubled homes, were given the opportunity to improve their reading and writing skills in the CAC program by learning the vocabulary of art, listening to stories and talking about characters, and working on art projects related to the stories. Student achievement in reading generally exceeded levels set as indicative of program success, with 88% of the second  graders and 92% of the students in grades three to six mastering at least three new skills on the McGraw-Hill Prescriptive Reading Inventory; and a high percentage of students in dual-cycle classes, as well as grade three and four single-cycle classes, mastering five or more new skills. Student achievement in writing also exceeded targeted goals, with over 50% of students in the program improving their proficiency. Finally, student achievement on the art vocabulary test exceeded criteria for program success. (Ten tables of data, sample tests, criteria, and questionnaires are included.) (ARH)",

Ten teachers in the treatment group were taught to recast traditional basal skills as strategies to be used flexibly and adaptively and to explain to students how to use these strategies in reading texts. Ten control teachers used the basal text in the standard way but received training in the use of management strategies. Results showed that although there was no difference between the concepts of reading stated by  teachers trained to be explicit in teaching reading as a strategic sense-making process and those not trained, their students differed in their concepts of reading and the teachers differed in the concepts of reading they communicated during their instruction. The study supports the importance of teachers having both pedagogical content knowledge as well as content knowledge. (Eleven tables of data are included, and 39 references are appended.) (MS)",

Subjects, 24 typical first-semester freshmen, participated in the course, with activities including: (1) focusing on a definition of dialogue and three implied questions asked in all reading and writing; (2) creating microcosmic questions and answers; (3) sentence-outlining sub-questions and answers; (4) dialogical &quot;sentence-debining&quot; and sentence-combining; and (5) keeping journals. Besides assignments in reading and writing, transfer of learning was sought by practicing dialogical communication, arranging  opportunities for discovering relationships between reading and writing, providing illustrative exercises, and suggesting ways to transfer learning beyond English class. The semester-long demonstration was monitored by six instruments: cloze reading samples, the Goodman miscue analysis, Buxton-scored writing samples, student interviews and instructor journal, and a questionnaire on instructional activities and the Student-Instructional Rating System (SIRS). Results indicated that the set of instructional activities was helpful in improving verbal and written communication.

Examination showed that content analyses of college reading materials issued before 1975 focused on studies analyzing the overall content of a text, and studies analyzing specific skills or subskills presented in a text. Contemporary content analyses concentrated on the perspectives of theory/research-driven analysis and curricular-driven analysis. Analysis revealed the following conclusions: (1) a consensus across texts as to what constituted  effective study methods did not exist; (2) research evidence for most of the advocated techniques was missing; (3) adequate instruction and practice for presented skills and subskills were limited in scope and validity; (4) transfer value of many practice activities to actual postsecondary reading and study tasks was in question; and (5) reliance on impressionistic evidence rather than research and statistical evidence was the norm.

        "description":"The teaching profession's present notion of the ability of teachers to contribute to theory development in language education needs reexamination. University researchers can best foster this ability by encouraging and assisting teachers to become engaged in classroom research. On the basis of both published evidence and field data, it can be argued that (1) teachers inescapably function as theorists, (2) their potential contributions to theory are vital to the growth of the profession, and (3) their work as theory builders is enhanced by engaging in the process of research. Current literature as well as examples from field work with researchers who teach in public school classrooms show that research enhances theory building by helping teachers focus observations, sharpen  research skill, and develop collegial relationships with other researchers and theorists. Finally, many current notions of teacher research are too limited to be useful in theory building. The vital contributions of teachers to language learning theory will come through their involvement in what James Britton called &quot;basic research.&quot; Inviting teachers, who live daily with the complex realities of language growth through language use, to be full partners in the enterprise of research and theory development is the &quot;best help&quot; for teachers, and the teaching profession as well. Teacher researchers can provide theoretical enrichment as thoughtful professionals constantly in touch with crucial data. (Fifty references are attached.) (RAE)",

The subjects, three males and five females, were selected from responses to a university campus advertisement. Six of them were working towards bachelor's degrees with varying majors. Two of the eight students had additional post-graduate training in psychology and none had a college physics course, although seven of the eight had taken physics in high school. Students with a range of grade-point averages were chosen so that learner differences could be examined. Subjects were given instruction in physics and required to demonstrate mastery of basic physical principles. Talk-aloud protocols  were employed to examine the way the subjects learned and understood the examples, and then used their understanding to solve problems. The subjects were split into two groups post hoc using a median split on their problem solving success. Results indicated that &quot;good&quot; students tend to study examples and exercises by explaining and providing justifications for each action and relate their explanations to the principles and concepts in the text. &quot;Poor&quot; students do not often explain the examples or exercises to themselves, and when they do, their explanations do not seem to connect their understanding with the principles and concepts in the text. The results provide, at a gross level, empirical evidence to support existing artificial intelligence models of explanation-based generalizations.

Much easier to implement than dramatic performances, reader's theater is seen as part theater and part oral interpretation. As outlined in the pamphlet, the procedures for implementing readers' theater in the classroom include (1) finding or writing scripts; (2) introducing and assigning parts; (3) rehearsing; (4) reassigning parts; (5) planning a performance; and (6) finally performing. The pamphlet lists the steps to help involve students in writing scripts as: selecting the story; making a photocopy to mark; labeling character and narrator parts; deleting non-essential information; reading aloud to edit; and typing. The pamphlet concludes that the  major benefits of readers' theater are increased oral reading, a deeper and more meaningful understanding of the elements of story such as character and plot development, and exposure to new books.

Subjects, 17 fourth graders and 16 fifth graders from one elementary school, had regularly received remedial reading comprehension instruction. Subjects were administered a pretest consisting of a self-efficacy test assessing children's perceived capabilities for correctly answering different types of questions that tapped comprehension of main ideas, and a reading comprehension skill test. Following the pretest, subjects were randomly assigned within sex and grade level to one of three experimental conditions--process goal, product goal, and instructional (general) goal. All students received 35-minute training sessions over 15  consecutive school days. Subjects' perceptions of their goals during the instructional sessions were assessed on the day following the last session, and subjects were also administered a posttest identical to the pretest except that a parallel form of the skill test was used. Results supported the theory that providing students with a specific learning goal can have important effects on achievement behaviors. Compared with students who received a general goal of working productively, those given either a process goal of learning to use a comprehension strategy or a product goal of answering questions demonstrated significantly higher self-efficacy on completion of the instructional program. Findings also showed that pursuing a learning process goal led to the highest comprehension skill.  (One table of data is included and 35 references are appended.) (MM)",

Subjects were 38 regular class third graders and 18 average intelligence fifth graders receiving resource room assistance for reading difficulties. Third grade regular class students were matched on spelling with fifth grade reading disabled students (achieving two years below grade level); average and below average spellers were identified in each class. As part of a larger study examining the relationship between cognitive processing and reading ability, subjects were administered achievement tests, cognitive processing tests, and a computerized spelling test.  Hypothesized underlying cognitive processes of memory access, memory span, simultaneous and successive processing, and phonological processing were examined and related to spelling performance. In addition, spelling errors made by the different groups on words differing in word familiarity and spelling predictability were analyzed using a developmental model of spelling. Results showed (to a limited extent) that the underlying cognitive processing supported the developmental lag hypothesis. The analysis of spelling errors much more strongly supported the notion that poor spellers were learning to spell according to a normal developmental pattern but at a much slower rate. In addition, the patterns identified through the analysis of spelling errors provided better diagnostic and  instructional information than the analysis of underlying cognitive processes.

Based on their performance on the comprehension portion of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, subjects were classified as good readers (43 students), average readers (39 students), and poor readers (18 students). The study employed four short reading passages, and constructed a second version of those passages by changing one or two words in a critical line to include information that contradicted earlier information in the passage. Consistent and inconsistent versions of the four passages were divided into two &quot;Passage Groups,&quot; each  containing two consistent and two inconsistent passages. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two passage groups; within each group, half the subjects received the four passages in random order, and half received the passages in reverse order. After reading each passage on microcomputer, students answered questions that probed for detection of text-based inconsistencies embedded in the passage. Results suggested that differences existed among good, average, and poor college readers in evaluation of text for coherence, but not in strategic repair following recognition of comprehension failure. Findings indicated that evaluation of text for coherence related to the nature of the reader's semantic involvement with the text, and that this involvement varied with reading ability.

        "description":"When teaching writing in content areas, such as hydrobiology, instructors should remember that what works in a writing class does not necessarily work across the curriculum. Yet although differences exist, content area teachers still need writing departments to teach their students to write. One possible response is the generic course, such as &quot;Writing in the Sciences.&quot; However, writing in biology is very different from writing in chemistry and physics--the problem with the generic approach is in trying to design one course to teach many different types of writing. Furthermore, writing teachers generally do not know enough about the assumptions, methods, and vocabulary in other disciplines to be able to judge accurately the writing in that discipline. If writing teachers consider  teaching generic courses, they need to recognize both their own limitations and the limitations of such courses. Beyond the generic course, two alternatives exist. First, content teachers can be encouraged to teach writing processes in their own classrooms, breaking writing assignments into smaller, more manageable chunks for their students. Secondly, a thorough study of academic writing should be made, analyzing the history of writing development in different fields to find similarities and differences. Perhaps with this knowledge, writing instructors could teach not simply a generic writing course, but methods for analyzing the writing in a discipline, for discovering its constraints, and for adapting prose to fit those constraints. Students would then be enabled to make their own  analysis and to adjust their writing accordingly. (One page of footnotes is appended.) (MM)",

        "description":"A truly diverse press not only takes seriously its political role of fostering robust debate but stands committed to its cultural role of providing a distinctively local context for the issues and discussions it reports. However, what contributes to the diminution of press diversity remains a controversial question that continues to attract considerable study and debate. The more particular question of the influence of ownership on the uniformity of news has led to inconclusive research. To take a closer look at this question, a study examined and compared the accounts of Gary Hart's involvement with Donna Rice in: (1) 29 newspapers owned by the Knight-Ridder chain; (2) a matched sample of 29 newspapers that were not owned by Knight-Ridder but that subscribed to the Knight-Ridder  news service; and (3) a matched sample of 27 newspapers that were neither owned by Knight-Ridder nor subscribers to the Knight-Ridder news service. Results showed that Knight-Ridder (owners of the &quot;Miami-Herald&quot; which first broke the story) newspapers as a group gave more and better play to the Gary Hart story, which points to the subtle influence that chains can exert on their member newspapers. The evidence also calls into question a chain's ability to meet the commitment to press diversity and a distinctly local agenda. (Thirty notes, one figure, and two tables of data are included.)

This practice was examined to determine whether there is a relationship between the length of time a reporter has been covering the police beat and his or her reported access. Full-time law enforcement reporters (N=23) at Tennessee's 11 largest daily newspapers, as well as their primary official sources (N=30) within the metropolitan police and sheriffs' departments to which they were assigned, were interviewed in person during March and April 1987. Results  indicated that differences between reporters and law enforcement sources in age, experience, and years in the community may account for some of the friction that exists in the police-press relationship in Tennessee. A common complaint was that young reporters did not understand police procedures and were often newcomers to the community. (Fourteen tables of data and 33 notes are included.) (MS)",

Using qualitative research methodology, the study investigated how the indigenous population reacted to the press laws. The Newspaper Ordinance law was selected because it was the first newspaper law enacted by the colonial government. Decree No. 4 was selected because it embodied all previously enacted post-independence press laws. Both laws were enacted by an authoritarian form of government--a colonialist/imperialist regime in one instance and a military dictatorship in the other. Analysis indicated that the  introduction of the first press law met with public resentment similar to the public opposition to the press law enacted by the Muhammadu Buhari military regime. The objectives of the press laws were found to be about the same, and the rationales for public resentment of the laws were congruent. Also, the public had similar reactions to both press laws, and used the press (especially the letters-to-the-editor columns) to express their resentment. (Five pages of footnotes are attached.)

The procedure has eight steps, some of which can be repeated as often as necessary: warm-up, process writing, sharing, revision, sharing, revision, editing group sharing, and revision. The warm-up gets the writer focused on the flow of writing. Process writing, 15-20 minutes of directed freewriting using any of 13 different approaches (such as first thoughts, dialogues, and narrative thinking) to thinking about the topic, fosters both  creativity and control over the topic. Sharing and editing take place in groups of students, the sharing groups concentrating on ideas rather than grammar and syntax. Assignments are turned in to the instructor only after going through several drafts and after editing by an editing group. By participating in sharing and editing groups, students essentially learn by teaching. As a result of using these techniques, the instructor's role changes from a grammar and mechanics corrector to that of a writing partner, guiding the students to the clear expression of their ideas.

        "description":"To determine when, if ever, deceptive acts can be morally justified in investigative reporting, it is important to distinguish a deceptive act that is morally justified from an act that is not deceptive in the first place. This paper seeks to provide an account of what counts as deception and identify the kinds of journalistic practice that are morally questionable; i.e., to identify the acts that require justification by journalists as investigators, interrogators, and informers. Journalists have acted deceptively, if they have, in the course of an investigation, through intentional action or assertion, attempted to initiate or sustain a false belief, or if they have allowed another person, with whom they have a special relationship, to initiate or sustain a false belief. The  journalist as interrogator has a duty to tell the source (1) that an interview for publication is taking place; (2) how the information is being recorded; and (3) if, through some misunderstanding and resultant action on the part of the source, the source becomes more likely to be harmed than he realizes. As informers, journalists have a duty to disclose information that the news organization has explicitly or implicitly promised to disclose, and that, if withheld, would lead readers to a false conclusion.

        "description":"Persuasion theories typically attempt to account for attitude change, but mass media reviews influence more ephemeral variables, the chief of which is &quot;interest&quot; in attending or otherwise consuming a cultural event or object. Reviewing and other forms of &quot;evaluative journalism&quot;--including much sports, consumer, and political reportage--affect interest primarily through variation in two variables: information and evaluation. A study examined the processes that accompany audience reaction to reviews. Subjects, 226 students enrolled in large introductory mass media courses for majors and non-majors at a state university, after a pretest, were randomly assigned to one of seven film-review treatments of different evaluative directions and information levels: (1) negative, mixed, and  positive reviews with a low level of information; (2) negative, mixed, and positive reviews with a high level of information; and (3) a &quot;non-review&quot; which contained a high level of information but no evaluative adjectives or phrases. A posttest was also administered. Results indicated that a high level of neutral information increased interest in a film compared with a low level, but information level was not as powerful as evaluation direction. Neutral information alone, however, increased interest almost as much as a positive, high-information review. (Nineteen notes, four tables of data, and one figure are included.) (MS)",

It also used earlier collected data to compare some characteristics of Chicago journalists with characteristics of rural editors in 1900. To examine quantitative materials that would support or refute qualitative information, data about the demographic characteristics of Chicago journalists was compiled from the 1900 federal census manuscripts. Results showed that by 1900 staff division of journalistic  labor was beginning to emerge. The analysis of census manuscripts for urban journalists in Chicago also indicated that (1) journalists were relatively young and less established in terms of family, children, and property when compared to their rural counterparts; (2) they were more likely to be women and Black than the rural journalist, but it was still an industry dominated by White males; and (3) they were more likely to be foreign born than were rural journalists and the United States population in general.

The &quot;collateral bar&quot; rule--which requires that court orders, even those later determined to be unconstitutional, must be complied with until amended or vacated--in effect, calls for journalists either to accept almost certain conviction for contempt, or to obey the order, seek review, and forfeit, temporarily or permanently, the First Amendment rights they seek to exercise. Courts in various jurisdictions have looked at the same history of the collateral bar rule and the First Amendment, and come to different conclusions on how they ought to be balanced, resulting in inconsistency and confusion. United States versus &quot;Privdence  Journal&quot; would have provided the first opportunity for the Supreme Court to consider directly the applicability of the collateral bar rule in a case where an unconstitutional prior restraint order had been issued against a news organization. The effectiveness of the courts depends on their ability to have orders obeyed. But if an invalid order prevents the exercise of First Amendment rights, and the appeal cannot be heard before the circumstances require public dissemination, journalists must be able to challenge the order when appealing a contempt conviction. Such a collateral bar challenge shows no more disrespect for the law than an invalid court order restricting freedom of speech and press. (Two hundred thirteen notes are included.) (MS)",

        "description":"Over the years, journalists, social scientists, and government commissions have defined news in a variety of ways, but their definitions consistently lack the notion that, above all, news is a commodity and must sell. Within the journalism profession, and particularly in television news, the potential for conflict between a media corporation's interest in maximizing profit and a journalist's obligation to maximize public understanding is rarely acknowledged. Yet the best interest of the corporation in getting the most for its stockholders often conflicts with the best interest of the public in understanding its environment. This pessimistic conclusion about journalism rests on a theory of news as a transaction between an information provider and consumer. An informal cost/benefit  analysis based on this theory can be used to develop a model for predicting news content. In this model, where news is seen as a transaction, the probability of an event or item of information being covered by corporate media is inversely proportional to the cost of discovery (what a news corporation expends to learn of events and information) and the cost of assembly (what a corporation expends to create the news account), and is proportional to the anticipated breadth and intensity of its appeal to audiences that advertisers value. The implications of this theory include the suggestion that news corporations are unlikely to accept social responsibilities that conflict with business interests. (Fifty-four references are listed.)

George Hillocks in &quot;Research on Written Composition,&quot; describes four instructional approaches: presentational, natural process, environmental, and individualized. The three latter approaches, although newer than the traditional presentational mode, emphasize process and still consider any interest in a written product as outside immediate concern. The latest preoccupation in writing seems to be narcissism--classifying, and teaching writing from a social, transactional, or epistemic perspective. The intention is not to divorce product from process, but that process must be reunited with product. If students are  to be adequately prepared for all kinds of writing, including the test essay, they need to be made aware of how situations differ rhetorically. Students need to know that there are many forms of discourse to suit many rhetorical situations. In order to develop this sensitivity, students need to be presented with a variety of assignments in which meaning and form are developed together through successive drafts, conferencing, peer evaluation, and extensive revisions, assignments with built-in constraints of time, topic, and form. Lloyd Bitzer's terms of exigence, constraints, and audience are also components which relate to writing assessment. (Fifteen references are attached.) (RAE)",

        "description":"An examination of the transformations that the concept of genius undergoes when viewed through the apparently incommensurable expressivistic and social views of composing helps to reconcile phenomenologically objective descriptions of composing with value-laden descriptions of the self in the act of writing. When the description of composition is changed, a different aspect of the complex act of composition is highlighted and the center of the composing act is moved to a new location. Both descriptions carry with them assumptions on the value of writing and of the notion of the &quot;self&quot; writing. A series of brief but contrasting descriptions of the composing process serves to suggest representative positions compositionists have taken. In the expressivistic view, the self struggles  both with and against language in order to understand and extend the autonomous self but loses opportunities to enlarge and enrich the self through participation in cooperative projects. The self in the social constructivist view must conform to linguistic form and convention but decreases self-definition. If Husserlian phenomenology is to aid in the study of the complex act of composing, it must take into account individuals composing in various scenes, directed toward different purposes, and using a variety of discourse forms. How composing processes are understood and described has important consequences for the writing teacher's students, not only in the classroom but later when they leave the university. (RS)",

Students completed a questionnaire about their home, school, and community, and each student was interviewed to verify answers on the questionnaire.

Two writing samples from each student were analyzed to correlate findings with results from the WAS and KTS, and two case studies  were analyzed. Results revealed a significant correlation between writers' attitudes and their personality traits, writing apprehension, and writing background. Eight of the ten students who tested &quot;extraversion&quot; on the KTS were not writing apprehensive.

However, now that the emotional considerations of war are no longer being discounted, it seems appropriate that many survivor books are being written by, and focusing on, women. In &quot;Casaulties: Death in Viet Nam; Anguish and Survival in America&quot; (1984), Heather Brandon models her book on the veterans' oral histories and discourse with the community of families who lost one of their own in the war. Joan Didion in &quot;Democracy&quot; offers glimpses into the lives of her fictional &quot;glitterati,&quot; reflecting snatches from the lives of  real-life public figures, disclosing more personally the struggle to situate oneself amid the shards of contemporary American historical experience, in which Vietnam figures prominently. Writing from and representing the opposite social perspective, West Virginia native Jayne Anne Phillips'&quot;Machine Dreams,&quot; which appeared, like &quot;Democracy,&quot; in 1984, focuses primarily on women. Phillips' subject is history and the passage of time, the dislocations peppering the lives of her characters, and she portrays the dissolution of family life as a reflection of individual lives fragmenting, and cultural order decaying.

In addition, when students choose their own interview subjects and read their write-ups in class, they are able to introduce both classmates and teacher to new sources of information. Finally, teachers who draw explicit attention to the processes involved in interviewing have a good opportunity to reinforce other elements of the writing course, as well as to demonstrate the relevance of the composition class to other facets of students' lives, in and  out of school.

        "description":"To learn when children would be able to evaluate and revise texts that presented significant comprehension problems, and to investigate the relationship between general reading skill and comprehension monitoring and revision skills, a study administered revision tests to 65 fourth grade and 38 sixth grade students from a rural New England school district. Students were classified as good, average, or poor readers on the basis of their reading comprehension scores on the Gates-MacGinitie test. Students participated in three revision tasks: (1) story writing and revision; (2) revision of a peer story; and (3) a comprehension monitoring and revision interview, where students were asked to evaluate and revise eight experimental texts containing different comprehension problems.  Results indicated that although students took their role as &quot;editors&quot; seriously and made suggestions for improving the texts, they had difficulty seeing that the sentences were inconsistent or that the information necessary for complete comprehension was not actually provided in the texts. Findings showed a strong relationship between students' reading ability and their comprehension monitoring and revision performance. Also, the performance of good readers improved more with age than that of average and poor readers. Finally, a comparison of students' performance on the different types of text problems showed that they were able to use several revision strategies, such as addition and deletion, to improve texts.

Stories were also coded for the same  characteristics as they applied to males. Analysis revealed that of 180 stories coded in &quot;The Dispatch,&quot; women were the main subject of one story and four &quot;Business Briefs,&quot; were quoted in 11 stories and one brief, had 10 bylines, and were featured in nine photos. In contrast, men were the main subject of 31 stories and 10 briefs, were quoted in 89 stories and eight briefs, had 35 bylines, and were depicted in 35 photos.

        "description":"An examination of the interrelated philosophical, political, economic, and cultural dimensions of the four normative media theories (authoritarian, Soviet-communist, liberal, and social responsibility) in a societal context based on power relationships leads to four conclusions of a general nature. First, the media in one nation can have different ownership and control structures, as well as several philosophies regarding the function of the media. Second, individual media structures can be included in the above distinction. Third, this approach provides a more appropriate methodology to analyze normative views on communication at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Fourth, as power relationships are looked at in a multidirected and dialectic fashion, this  approach does not limit itself to a top-down perspective only. This implies that participatory or user-oriented modes of communication can also be explained and analyzed from this perspective. The importance of including a societal context based on power relationships is illustrated in the different ways that the concepts &quot;freedom of information&quot; and &quot;free flow of information&quot; are interpreted in cultures throughout the world. An illustration of the participatory mode of communication and the freedom from the limitation of the top-down power relationship is the recent international effort to establish the right to communicate, the active and passive human right of the receiver to inform and be informed.

        "author":["Ferrante, Karlene"],
        "description":"Sexism and racism in advertising have been well documented, but feminist research aimed at social change must go beyond existing content analyses to ask how advertising is created. Analysis of the &quot;mirror assumption&quot; (advertising reflects society) and the &quot;gender assumption&quot; (advertising speaks in a male voice to female consumers) reveals the fact that the advertising industry is a patriarchal institution which has capitalized on and reinforced women's position in the patriarchal order. Rather than mirroring society, ads exaggerate some parts of the picture while minimizing or even eliminating others. Rather than reflecting stereotypes which exist in society, ads actively promote them in order to sell more products. Once feminist researchers become aware that the &quot;mirror  assumption&quot; is false, they can direct their energies to the implications of the &quot;gender assumption&quot; with its artificial social order of men as active authority figures and women as passive product users.

        "description":"In an effort to help describe and explain why people do not read and subscribe to newspapers, a study built on previous research by adding two new contributions: (1) reliance on a four-wave panel data-set rather than on a one-shot survey; and (2) use of a dynamic modeling procedure rather than cross-sectional analysis. The problem with previous studies of newspaper subscribing that use static comparison, is that the technique may be sufficient for descriptive purposes but can do little beyond that. Use of a longitudinal study that links &quot;actual&quot; changes in lifestyles to changes in subscribing status with a four-wave panel data-set solved this problem. A data-set from the American Society of Newspaper Editors' Readership and Research Committee (ASNE) and a dynamic modeling tool  developed by Paul Allison were used to supply data. Results indicated that there were two underlying processes going on in the subscribing decision, and that static and dynamic variables played different roles in influencing these processes. Results also showed that the conventional cross-sectional comparison is not sufficient to capture and explain this complexity, whereas dynamic analysis on longitudinal data may improve knowledge of the process.

        "description":"To develop a method of categorizing public relations practitioners according to a hierarchy of professionalism which would also identify what training is needed to raise those in lower levels to higher levels, a study surveyed 93 Iowa practitioners listed in the 1986-87 Public Relations Society of America Register Issue. Response rate was 66% and usable rate was 54%. The survey used James Grunig's four models of public relations--press agent/publicity, public information, two-way asymmetric, and two-way symmetric--which combined two dimensions (direction of communication and balance of intended effect) to conceptualize public relations. Based on responses on a five-point Likert scale to 27 public relations model indexes, respondents were separated into the four models. The  respondents within each model were then statistically tested to determine how well they correlated with 16 common public relations procedures. Next, the procedures were factor analyzed to determine if patterns existed, other than the four models already proposed, that would better stratify responses in a meaningful hierarchy of sophistication. Analysis indicated little support for the four-model approach to categorizing practitioners according to their activities. Results of the factor analysis showed a strong pattern of specialization among practitioners, indicating little crossover of activities between levels.

        "description":"In this essay, Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory (which seeks to explain how individuals try to reconcile holding two inconsistent beliefs at the same time) is used to explore the nature of expectancy effects and what possible roles they play in the thinking of the radical right. The paper first defines expectancy effects and explains how they work by discussing three variables in the expectancy process: senders' disposition, reinforcement, and correspondence bias. The theory of expectancy effects is then used in the paper to examine three of the groups who supported Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s to show that even though the beliefs that each group holds may be false, when each group looks for ways to resolve this tension between beliefs, they create an additional  false predisposition. The groups are the pseudo-conservatives (so-called by Richard Hofstadter), certain ethnic groups, and small businessmen. Next, the paper examines how the rest of the expectancy process works with the radical right. The paper concludes that expectancy effects are a useful tool for explaining the implications of the tension reducing strategies described by Festinger. (Twenty notes are included.) (MS)",

        "description":"The shooting down of KAL Flight 007, a South Korean airliner, by a Soviet jet fighter, and the resulting deaths of the 269 people on board, has brought into focus the Reagan's administration's equivocal relationship with the Soviet Union, provided insights into the channels of power in the Soviet military hierarchy, and led other nations to concentrate on international codes of conduct for the superpowers. A study explored in detail one of the first news reports about the flight. In addition, the study examined United States representations of the Soviet Union, and more broadly, the relationship of news to cultural life. The first account of the shooting of Flight 007 in the &quot;New York Times&quot; (September 2, 1983) was analyzed by using Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic approach. The  analysis found that in the &quot;New York Times&quot; report, the international incident: (1) was portrayed in the narrow context of United States affairs, (2) was firmly grounded in American culture; (3) gave heavy emphasis to American officials, American reactions, and possible American reprisals; and (4) affirmed a dominant United States role in world affairs. The analysis also revealed that the report could be seen as a drama of victimage that creates and then castigates an enemy shared by a group in a dramatic enactment that offers integration, identification, and social cohesion.

The study examined viewer reactions to four local stations'&quot;news teams&quot; and individual news &quot;personalities,&quot; focusing strictly on viewership of their primary newscasts, and using a parasocial framework, developed by Rebecca B. Rubin, consisting of 20 statements tapping parasocial interaction in TV news. Prior to the interviewing, a pretest using a similar survey was conducted, involving residents of Athens, Ohio. For the Denver survey, 800 phone numbers were selected at random and 303 valid responses were obtained. Findings revealed a high correlation  between news team parasocial interaction and viewership, with news teams having the greatest numbers of viewers also evoking the greatest parasocial interaction. Yet although audience members conceded their parasocial inclinations, they did not discriminate well between the personalities, possibly indicating that TV news parasocial interaction is team-centered.

Out of 516 valid responses, the survey yielded a sample of 233 VCR households; 71 VCR renting households, also located in the telephone survey, were not included in the analysis. Descriptive information and mean comparisons were used to reflect activities and attitudes in relation to VCR and TV use between viewers who reallocated their leisure time because of VCR ownership, and those who did not. Findings suggested that after owning a VCR, the majority of viewers reallocated their leisure time  to spend more time at home watching television or videos with family members, friends, or relatives. Furthermore, VCR owners who reallocated their leisure time activities were also likely to make more home recordings, watch more television or pre-recorded videos, and express greater satisfaction with their overall television and VCR use.

Conditions were identical except for the style of the target stories and their placement within the newscast. Subjects, 111 undergraduate communications and public relations students at a western university, were randomly assigned to eight viewing groups. Immediately following the newscast viewing, subjects were given a free  recall test, in which they listed all the stories they could remember, and also wrote down everything they remembered about each story. A cued recall test for the two target stories was then administered, and finally, subjects completed a multiple choice test on information contained in the target stories. Results showed that the recollections of subjects who viewed the chronological presentation were more accurate than those of subjects who viewed the traditional broadcast presentation.

Videotapes of the TWA hostage incident from &quot;ABC World News Tonight,&quot;&quot;CBS Evening News,&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; during the period of June 14 through June 30, 1985, were analyzed according to the televised news source--defined as the videotaped &quot;sound bite&quot; of the newsmaker as seen and heard in the context of a network news report. For this study, televised news sources were included in the analysis when they were seen and heard on camera in either an interview, public speech, or studio setting in both live and prerecorded contexts. A total of 790 &quot;sound bites&quot; were broadcast in  244 stories during the 17-day incident, with CBS televising the largest percentage of news. News stories which qualified as news commentary or analysis were not included in the study. Each &quot;sound bite&quot; was coded using a list of variables including network, source type, source status, time length, source setting, and newscast placement. Results showed that the sources televised during the TWA hijacking were most frequently unofficial, domestic sources. Over half of these sources were either hostages or relatives and friends of hostages, suggesting that network coverage of terrorism tends to relate a &quot;human&quot; drama in which hostages and their families are portrayed as the central characters.

        "description":"To understand better the ethical inclinations of public relations students, a study examined students' self-reported ethical beliefs and behaviors regarding their college work. In two mid-Atlantic state universities, a questionnaire was administered to communication classes for college juniors and seniors during the winter term 1988, yielding 258 usable responses (70% of the eligible sample). The questionnaire consisted of 26 items in each of three &quot;belief&quot; and two &quot;behavior&quot; situations relating to college work, such as writing term papers, taking tests, and doing homework. Items were measured on five-point response categories ranging from &quot;very unethical&quot; to &quot;not at all unethical,&quot; and examined the ethical beliefs of public relations students, their perceptions of the ethical  beliefs of most college students, their perceptions of the ethical beliefs of their professors, their self-reported ethical behaviors, and their perceptions of the ethical behaviors of most college students. Factor analysis identified four primary ethical dimensions: (1) traditional behaviors (unethical behaviors among students); (2) normative behaviors (caused when social pressures exert influence on behavior regardless of personal beliefs); (3) collegial-support behaviors (opportunistic behaviors related to the intent to create a supportive environment for involvement in unethical behaviors); and (4) substitution behaviors (for example, taking a test for another student). Results indicated that the students' ethical beliefs were moderately high, but were rated lower than those of their  professors and higher than those of their colleagues.

        "description":"While a person's &quot;interest&quot; is recognized as important in seeking information about science, few studies have investigated what people mean when they say they are interested in a science story or have investigated the effects of that interest on memory for science information. Two studies tested several hypotheses on two components of interest, relevance and entertainment value, and on the link between interest and memory. In the first study, subjects, 150 undergraduate students at a large midwestern university who received extra credit in journalism courses for their participation, viewed three 90-second &quot;Science Reports for Television,&quot; and then were tested on their perceived interest in the specific report. The second study, which used 80 undergraduate students at another  university (they received extra credit in a variety of speech and communication courses), was identical to the first except that it added a fourth story and several questions to the questionnaire. Results of the first study indicated that the two components of interest, relevance and entertainment value, predicted most of the variance in self-reports of interest for television science stories. The difficulty and familiarity of the story predicted small or insignificant amounts of variance in interest. Results of the second study found that interest measures predicted a significant amount of variance in memory for only some stories.

To explore the dimensions of this myth, a study examined data, available from a national sample of television reporters and news producers, to determine the differences between these two groups of broadcast journalists in terms of professional training, motivations for pursuing careers in broadcast journalism, their career plans, and the manner in which they would handle a hypothetical news decision. Subjects, 512 reporters (out of a sample of 793) and 126 producers (out of a sample of 199), randomly selected, were  asked about their attitudes towards television news and for demographic information. Results showed that producers were less critical than reporters of their stations' newscasts and that producers were also likely to have pursued television news careers for more pragmatic and less idealistic reasons than reporters. However, there was little evidence that reporters are fighting for the journalistic integrity of television news against producers who are interested only in the show-business aspects of television.

Each quarter, 1,000 homes in cabled areas were interviewed by telephone to establish awareness, viewership, and satisfaction levels for over thirty programming services, including community and access channels. Both the head of the household and a randomly selected household member age 12 or older were interviewed in each home; interviews were completed in 60 percent of the eligible homes listed for the survey and a total of 1322 usable responses were  obtained. Other measures included in the study were demographic variables, such as respondent's sex, employment status, marital status, household size, ethnicity, age, education, and income. Results revealed that nearly 60% of all homes serviced by cable were served by at least one community channel, and 16% of the overall audience reported viewing a community channel within the week preceding their interview. Findings also suggested that access viewers were likely to be better educated, older, retired, and have lower incomes. (Nine tables of data, seven footnotes, and 22 references are appended.) (MM)",

        "description":"The goal of this paper is to describe how one classroom teacher uses the Sender-Receiver Communications Model to illustrate for students in a lively and memorable way the process of &quot;targeting your audience&quot; with medium and message. Students are used as examples of Receivers, or target audience, illustrating the potential range of characteristics (age, ethnicity, attitudes, etc.) and how instructors, as Senders, use these factors to shape communication with students. In this context, the need for demographic and psychographic research becomes clear. Next, the use of research to determine the choice of medium--the vehicle on which a message is delivered, such as radio, posters, or tee shirts--is discussed, noting the key factors of reception and credibility which influence  audience preference. Many factors also affect the credibility of the Sender, including intentions, trustworthiness, and expertise, as perceived by the target audience. Several factors which can contribute to a failure to communicate are illustrated in the model. Entropy, or the tendency for matter to tend toward disorder, contributes to miscommunication through typos, misspellings, and other fact errors. The &quot;Gatekeeper&quot; (the person--for example, an editor--who decides whether a message will appear in the medium) is another important facet of the model, as are the elements of feedback and environment. After presenting the model, an exercise is assigned to students to reinforce how this information can be used in communication efforts.

Only students who had completed at least six years of study in Missouri public schools participated in the study. To determine if students viewed their experiences as predominantly left or right brain oriented, or integrated, subjects identified the degree to which they had experienced various types of educational endeavors throughout their kindergarten through grade 12 experiences. Subjects also completed the Hough Brain Dominance Test to determine individual brain-dominance preferences. Responses showed that students perceived their public school experiences to be sometimes analytical, often sequential, concrete, rational, active, and quite goal-oriented, indicating that the students viewed their education in a traditional left-brain fashion. Similarly, students perceived the right-brain functions to be less dominant. (Two tables of data are included, and the student survey, brain dominance survey, results of brain dominance self-evaluation, five tables of data, and 28 references are appended.

Fifty-one programs for children and teens, selected on the basis of Nielsen ratings of the top 20 prime-time programs in November 1985 and November 1986, were analyzed with a mixture of quantitative and qualitative content analysis and elements of audience research. Results showed programs can be placed in two categories: (1)  programs in which the producers seemed to be making a conscious effort to include some content of special interest to, and with potential benefit for, children and teens, including, but not limited to, messages concerning educational and vocational motivations and aspirations and achievement; and (2) programs in which there is little if any focus on learning in the broad sense or education in the narrow sense. Programs in both categories have considerable sex stereotyping, contain little information about occupations and schools, and focus on middle and upper socio-economic status and materialism.

The communications student who rationalizes academically dishonest behavior as a means of coping with academic pressure may later behave unethically in highly competitive work situations. Honest students may find themselves at a disadvantage regarding grades, scholarships, graduate school, and employment. Employers and graduate schools, disappointed with the job performance of a student with a high (dishonestly obtained) G.P.A., may in future discount the abilities of other students from the same university. If instructors allow cheating, their own reputations and marketability may suffer. Six suggestions may aid in curbing and  preventing cheating: (1) cheating and penalties should be explained during the first class session; (2) tests and quizzes should be duplicated under strict security; (3) small group assignments should include individual assignments in which students judge the extent of their own and other students' participation; (4) cheating policies should be enforced; (5) proceedings against an accused student should be publicized, though maintaining the student's rights to confidentiality; and (6) due process should be ensured. Future research should identify the most prevalent problems by surveying students and faculty, and listing past occurrences among professionals. (SR)",

Lederman and L. P. Stewart in 1985) could enhance, clarify, and extend its findings. Managers were asked to write down what they would say to their subordinates in order to elicit the desired performance. What was not known was whether what the managers wrote was an accurate reflection of what they would actually say. Also not known was which managers were considered effective by their superiors or by their subordinates, or whether their chosen strategies would have worked in the sample situations. Using the Marble Company simulation with a series of intact groups (role-playing students or faculty) information on  verbal and nonverbal behaviors was collected. Video cameras, stationary and portable, and unobtrusive observers were used during the three simulations. Results indicated that although the nonverbal behavior that the cameras were able to catch was invaluable in filling in and verifying or modifying personal observations, trained human observers were essential. Also, the debriefing session was an extremely valuable source of information. Motives offered and what individuals had done, compared to what others thought those individuals had done, frequently differed. Findings suggest that there are advantages and disadvantages to the Marble Company simulation (and in using simulation in general) but simulations can be a rich source of data on human communication.

        "description":"The emergence of frequency modulation or FM radio signals, which arose from the desire to free broadcasting of static noise common to amplitude modulation or AM, has produced the controversial development of stereo broadcasting. The resulting enhancement of sound quality helped FM pass AM in audience shares in less than two decades. The basic groundwork for FM stereo was laid in 1955 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed FM multiplexing, where one transmitter sends out two simultaneous (and, possibly different) signals. By April 20, 1961, the FCC allowed FM stations to broadcast stereo with multiplex, creating considerable excitement in the broadcast industry. The decision to allow stereocasting for AM radio was much more problematic. The FCC, in 1982 (after  years of debate) finally decided that, rather than pick a single standard to ensure rapid facilitation of stereo on AM stations, they would instead pass the decision process to the marketplace. The FCC sent the AM stereo decision to the marketplace out of confusion and desperation. The changing role of the Commission during deregulation of radio directly affected AM stereo, particularly since both proceedings were being dealt with by the FCC simultaneously. The result was that the FCC failed to set a standard. The major difference between the evolution of FM stereo and AM stereo was the changing policy of the FCC. The outcome made it clear that self-regulation of the airwaves is a difficult task. (Ninety-eight references are appended.) (MS)",

A study describes the nature of commentary on religion by the mass media by examining recent editorial cartoons that refer to religious subjects. One hundred and fifty-one editorial cartoons from 24 newspapers published in the United States over a 13-month period beginning September 1, 1986, were studied for visual content, metaphors, and thematic narratives offered about religion. Findings showed that in the editorial cartoons (1) religion was pictured as a competitive arena with religious  groups and leaders battling over &quot;turf&quot; or concentrating on fundraising at the expense of spiritual service; (2) images and narratives portrayed religion as dominated by combative leaders obsessed with self-interest, whose practices are diametrically opposed to the standards of modesty, stewardship, and emphasis on spiritual values that is normally assumed leaders will hold; (3) religious issues are nothing sacred and they have become a part of the fabric of political and economic affairs, not just the culture; and (4) cartoonists were guided by a vision of traditional religious values.

In the first study, 100 undergraduate students at a large eastern university were interviewed, while the second study surveyed 100 other undergraduates, both studies asking their subjects to reflect back on such an utterance in a heterosexual relationship. Results indicated that males typically said &quot;I love you&quot; first and their motivation included sharing true feelings, attempts at secondary gains, comforting behavior, and sheer confusion. It was also found that this expression was usually pre-planned and ultimately seemed to have a positive impact on the  relationship, though different expressions of the sentiment carried different weights, and a diverse pattern of receiver-reaction was evident.

Japanese industry has developed a corporate model that may have provided the concepts involved in organizational culture: ideology, beliefs, rituals, myths, and symbols. Organizational culture is inextricably interwoven with speech communication, but organizational communication entails more than just speech communication. A recent survey has found that professional communicators rate the ability to define corporate and communications objectives as their most important concerns. Technical writing is also a prime concern of corporate professionals. The manner in which organizations and the people who work within them use language is directly  related to the concept of organizational culture, since language is the prime element with which values are articulated and communications are transmitted and understood.

        "description":"With the latest appointment to the United States Supreme Court, five of the nine justices have indicated a willingness to consider some form of camera coverage in federal courts. The landmark cases, Estes versus Texas (1965) and Chandler versus Florida (1980), called for more data prior to reconsideration of the issue. An in-depth examination of original documents concerning the development of the American Bar Association's (ABA) 1937 camera ban, reveals that although the press/bar committee considering the issue recommended implementation of camera coverage of proceedings, and delegates to the 1937 convention agreed, internal ABA politics and other factors led to the paradoxical vote by the same delegates to accept a different committee's recommendation of the ban. Regarding the  status of courtroom cameras today, 43 states permit some form of coverage in the state courts. There are no cameras in federal courts, because of a specific federal ban on courtroom cameras. The author of a recent definitive study of courtroom coverage has concluded that the research indicates that many of the prejudicial influences once thought to result from cameras in courtrooms actually develop regardless of the presence of the media and are due to the intrinsic nature of the trial process.

The survey sample consisted of individuals from a broad range of age groups with 35% aged 19-21, 24% aged 22-25, 19% between 26 and 35, and 20% over 35 years of age. The questionnaire was designed to survey a broad range of factors relevant to service jobs. The final version consisted of 94 questions, 25 of which were the original Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA) items. Analysis revealed that service workers chose their occupations in accordance with their level of communication apprehension, supporting the theory that high communication apprehensive individuals choose occupations they perceive as  requiring little communication. Those in service and particularly management jobs reported much lower levels of communication apprehension, whereas those that desired or thought they would be working in a manufacturing job reported higher levels of communication apprehension. Management should provide a positive work climate where employees can solve problems on the spot and have a degree of freedom and independence, and also upgrade the service worker image in their training programs.

        "description":"Issue advertising is intended to inform an audience--most commonly with the intent of changing unfavorable opinions or reinforcing favorable ones--to affect cognition (in contrast to the behavioral emphasis of product and service advertising, intended to stimulate trail and adoption). To explore public reactions to printed and televised issues advertising, a study looked into reactions of university students to the current campaign sponsored by the United States Committee for Energy Awareness (USCEA). Seventy-four female and 42 male students, divided into four groups, were exposed to a magazine advertisement and three 30-second television advertisements on issues related to energy. One group served as control, one read the printed ad, one saw the videotapes, and one both viewed  the tape and read the ad. All then responded to a questionnaire indicating their support/opposition to nuclear energy. Analysis of their answers suggests that, in some regards, issues advertisements influence opponents of public policy more than they influence supporters. Supporters of nuclear energy simply continued their beliefs and arguments for it, while opponents generated an increased number of arguments against nuclear energy (not by refuting the advertisements' claims, but by stressing other issues). These effects were most pronounced among those who saw the videos, which suggests that issue advertisement effects may vary both across and within forms of media.

Surveys were sent to 302 Associated Press managing editors of daily newspapers (with a 48% response rate), and included an explanation about and photograph of videotex. Editors responded to statements about readers' problems in accessing, reading, and finding satisfaction in electronic news delivery. In addition, the survey was uploaded into 117 different areas of CompuServe Information Services, the largest videotex service in the United States. Videotex reader respondents were  videotex users in a non-experimental, non-laboratory situation with a variety of interests and reasons for using videotex services. Results suggested that editors have become more negative about audience members' ability to use videotex for news. More editors in 1987 than in 1976 saw videotex as a problem for readers to use, and all of the items were perceived as problems by more editors than readers. Results showed that editors in 1976 were more accurate than current editors at perceiving audience reactions to videotex. In general, videotex was not a problem for readers.

Besides certain constitutional rights (including parents' right to direct their children's education), parents and students have been granted various rights under state and federal statutes. This book aims to demystify the law and provide parents with the necessary knowledge to assert their rights (outside the court system) and bring violations to the attention of teachers, administrators, and other parents so that their children receive an appropriate education. Following a brief overview of parents' rights, chapters 2 through 6 discuss rights derived from the Constitution, including a student's right to fair treatment by a school disciplinary system, First Amendment  protections of freedom of speech and press, freedom of religion and separation of church and state, and equal educational opportunity. Chapters 7 through 9 focus on the common law and state control of education, covering compensation for injured children, damages collection for poor teaching, and conflicts between parent and state education agencies. Chapter 10 treats parents' rights concerning school records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Chapter 11 discusses federal law governing rights of parents of children with special education needs, highlighting the Education for All Children Act of 1975. Chapter 12 concerns physical appearance (proper dress), while chapter 13 confronts the rights of poor and non-English-speaking parents and children. The final  chapter covers legal literacy for parents. Three appendices provide constitutional amendments of special relevance to parents and students, legal research hints, and two Supreme Court decisions.

The paper also explores other relevant studies published through early 1983. First, four research and evaluation studies on cadres of organizational specialists (in \"Keele\"--a fictitious town--Washington; Eugene, Oregon; Buffalo, New York; and New South Wales, Australia) are discussed, along with more recent efforts in Colorado, Florida, Idaho, and California. Next, the paper reviews 13 large-scale research studies, including the Cooperative Project for Educational Development (1965), a high school renewal  project (1979), an Oregon organizational training project (1970), and an Oregon innovative elementary schools project (1970). A dozen other studies are briefly discussed. Last, the chief conclusions from OD research in schools are summarized. Entry and start-up success depends on adequate staff orientation time, staff consent, readiness to risk change, support from the top, and an active staff \"variety pool.\" During transition, OD projects have little chance of success if efforts are focused on improving individuals as individuals. OD's success is more likely when connected with an educational improvement program stressing tasks, not personal growth. Outcomes vary depending on intent and can increase trust, improve comunication, and help facilitate stressful organization changes. Included  are 89 references. (MLH)",

This paper discusses the development, accuracy, resilience, and management of the grapevine. Since grapevines do not develop by managerial design, they ignore formal communication channels and are affected by building and office layout and by common hobbies and activities, not to mention lunch schedules, family ties, social relationships, common home towns, and committee work. Messages travel along the grapevine at an alarmingly rapid pace, whether information is correct or distorted. The grapevine is extremely resilient and is  unlikely to be eliminated or formalized by executive fiat. For this reason, administrators must learn to manage the informal network by (1) using it; (2) being as candid as possible; (3) effectively screening employees; and (4) admitting mistakes quickly. Failure to understand and manage the grapevine properly will cause frustrating management problems. (MLH)",

Questionnaires were sent to 205 secondary school principals (of whom 76 responded), randomly selected to represent each school board in Ontario. The questionaires elicited (1) background information on the principals' current use of computers; (2) information on school scheduling procedures; and (3) information on types of information needed by educational  administrators that could then be part of the Management Information System. Findings identified the range of hardware and software currently in use by educational administrators, along with the reasons for using each piece of software. The reasons for not using computer technology were also solicited, and the most common response was lack of resources of all types (human, fiscal, capital and consumable, time, information, and expertise). The final section of the report provides recommendations on a systemwide basis for overcoming the reluctance to change, along with concrete suggestions for the training of educational administrators in the use of computer technology to assist them in their planning tasks.

The second section lists general population characteristics for each state, including per-capita income, educational attainment of adults, and percent voting. The third section  focuses on financial resources of each state, including gross state product per school-age child and relative tax capacity index. The fourth section provides statistics on student needs, based on the school-age population in poverty and the percent of K-12 enrollments in private schools. The final section provides data collected from questionnaires on the features of the states' educational programs. Included are comparative statistics on instructional time, school participation, teacher preparation and certification, and effective schooling programs. Color-coded maps are provided to illustrate each of these tables. A final section addresses gaps in the data presented and describes future efforts to obtain data on educational outcomes. (TE)",

Chapter 1 describes the two main types of Catholic school boards: consultative boards, in which the pastor of the diocese has final authority to accept the recommendations; and boards with limited jurisdiction, constituted by the pastor to govern the parish education program, subject to certain decisions reserved to the pastor and the bishop. Chapter 2 outlines the laws affecting Catholic education in the United States, including constitutional law, statutes and regulations, common law, and contract law. Chapter 3 discusses tort liability of schools, focusing on cases brought against schools  for negligence, corporal punishment, search and seizure, and defamation. Chapter 4 discusses the duties and rights of school employees, particularly with regard to discipline and dismissal of teachers. Chapter 5 discusses the duties and responsibilities of board members to the diocese and church, to the principal, to teachers, and to parents, students, and the community. The concluding chapter offers general recommendations to Catholic board members for dealing with tort law, for developing a parent/student handbook that expresses the school board's philosophy, and for adhering to due process.

        "description":"To foster individual development, educators must seek the gifts in every child, in those not demonstrating academic abilities as well as in the most brilliant. Instead of stifling thinking, creativity, and interest development, educators must encourage these behaviors. Currently, a big discrepancy exists between the child's potential and what schools actually value or stimulate. This bulletin first examines some barriers to developing children's creativity, thinking, and interests, such as low self-concept, lack of training opportunities, testing for facts instead of relationships, fragmented curricula, short-term views on course content, and negative attitudes toward creativity. Chapter 2 discusses the meaning of creativity and explores whether it should be nurtured in all  children or only in the gifted and talented through a continuum of creative behaviors. Chapter 3 looks at ways to support cognitive development and the relationship between thinking and creativity. Chapter 4 treats the importance of interests in the child's learning and development and discusses types of interests, how they are structured, and the relation of interests to creativity. The final two chapters discuss practical strategies for supporting creativity, thinking, and interests at the district, school, and classroom levels. To produce Renaissance or visionary men and women will require a reexamination of play, interest development, self-regulation, and autonomy in early creative development. Included are 7 figures and 146 references. (MLH)",

        "author":["Schwartz, Audrey J."],
        "description":"Although viable leadership models for schools with differing social contexts are in great demand, empirical studies of high school principals have not produced consistent results. This paper summarizes part of a larger project designed to identify leadership behaviors of principals in &quot;gang-impacted&quot; and other secondary schools. The research was stimulated by reports that menacing gang behavior at some schools was adversely affecting academic programs and the learning environment. The selection of 19 high schools in East Los Angeles County (California) was driven by concern about the area's rapidly increasing teenage Latino population and the Latino gang epidemic already rampant in Los Angeles City schools. The study conceptualized principal leadership behavior as derived from  two separate, but related theoretical strands: theories about the multidimensionality of leadership and contingency theories about interaction between leadership behavior and organizational context. Multidimensional theories include behviors focused either on organizational goals or social and emotional aspects of the organization. Contingency theory asserts that different situations require and often produce different leadership behaviors. The study variables were school social context, four principal leadership behaviors, and seven pupil attitudes defining school climate. Results showed that patterns of principals' leadership behavior vary and that the relationships between these patterns and climates differ in schools with different social contexts. Principals in hostile schools  exhibit significantly more control orientation and significantly less administrative task orientation than do principals in safe schools. Further conclusions are discussed. Included are 3 footnotes, 16 additional references, and 19 tables. (MLH)",

The North Carolina General Assembly has furnished much of the necessary funds. The program provides higher standards, smaller classes, the chance to become fluent in a foreign language, more instructional materials, counseling, dropout prevention, inschool suspension, compensatory education, advanced placement programs, an addition of 11,048 teachers, a monitoring procedure concerning the quality of education and school facilities that will be implemented by 1993, and staff development. In addition to traditional curricular offerings, the Basic Education Program's curriculum includes second language study and arts education that are mandatory for students in K-5. North  Carolina is the first state to provide second language study to students in K-5. The program also features free summer school for students in K-11 if they fail to meet promotion standards or if they need remedial instruction; the use of computers for computer literacy, for automating media centers and student accounting systems, and for routing and scheduling buses; a four-year pilot program that rewards the performance of teachers with salary increases; other programs and facilities that benefit teachers; and programs that encourage good students to become teachers.

        "description":"Increasing numbers of children are meeting state compulsory education requirements at home rather than at school. Although home instruction was once the mainstay of frontier American education, some educators now regard the practice as suspect. This paper hopes to reconcile opposing views by examining home schooling, including numbers of children, curricula, and some testing data. The report briefly reviews official responses to home instruction, with special attention to constitutional limits on state regulation, and suggests how public educators and home schoolers can cooperate. Home schoolers differ philosophically, but firmly agree that parents should be deeply involved in their children's education and development. The number of home schooled children has grown from about  15,000 in the early 1970s to between 120,000 and 260,000 children today. The movement may have peaked due to the enormous parental time commitment involved and the widening availability of Christian schools. The curricular packages examined show that home schools follow no standard pattern. Scattered testing data suggest that home schooling successes are more numerous than failures regarding both academic and social development. After reviewing state policies and court actions, the paper argues for increased cooperation between public officials and home schoolers to help identify rare cases of child abuse or neglect and enrich the database for child development and learning. Included are a list of interviewees, notes, 13 references, a list of cases, and an appendix describing home  schooling in the Appalachia Educational Laboratory's region. (MLH)",

        "description":"Kentucky's Institute for Beginning Principals was designed and implemented by a study group sponsored jointly by the Kentucky Association of School Administrators (KASA) and the Appalachia Educational Laboratory (AEL). AEL's study group concept calls for an association to select a topic for study--one of high priority in the state related to school improvement. It next calls for appointing members willing to serve on such a group and to define the scope of their study such that it can be accomplished with limited funds in a reasonable time period (12 to 24 months). This report is a summary of the KASA-AEL study group's work, from the selection of a topic, through the planning stages, to the culmination of their work in the 1987 Institute for Beginning Principals. The research  question chosen by the study group was: how can KASA help beginning principals have an effective first year? Identified as the study population were 55 Kentucky principals who had completed their first year of service in 1985-86. The bulk of the report describes and tabulates the results of 34 completed interviews concerning that first year and revolving around these issues: most rewarding experiences; helpful resources; problem areas; major time-consuming and preferred tasks; effective principalship areas; adequacy of preservice preparation; inservice experiences; recommended orientation for the job; and demographic information. Appended are the interview instrument employed by the study group; the codes used for KASA-AEL interviews; tables displaying data on principals' tasks, inservice  experience, and demographic characteristics; the institute agenda, participants' list, and handouts; and evaluation results of the institute.

        "description":"A random telephone survey was conducted in July 1987 as part of a collaborative effort by the Kentucky School Board Association and the Appalachia Educational Laboratory to discover the public's perceptions about the local school board's role. Survey questions, fielded by trained and supervised interviewers, also addressed public opinions about the quality of Kentucky public schools. The survey represents a cross-section of the state, including five main regions (Appalachia, Bluegrass, Northern Kentucky, Louisville and environs, and Western Kentucky). Interviewees included adults from urban and rural areas, either working or not working, representing a wide range of educational experience, and including parents of school aged children as well as those without children in school.  Of the 473 respondents, 54 percent were female and 46 percent were male. Most were lifetime Kentucky residents, and two-thirds lived in rural communities or small towns. Findings show that 70 percent of respondents would like local school boards to have more decision-making influence than at present. A full 75 percent said they had never received any information or communication from their school board; the same number depended on the news media for this information. Also, 48 percent said they had voted in the previous fall's board elections. People's reasons for not voting included not being registered, not being interested, not having children in school, or not having enough information. Among those voting, the 25-40 age group had the highest proportion of school-age children, but were  not more likely to have voted than other groups. People over 41 were more likely to vote in school elections, tended to express more trust in their local school boards, and gave their schools a higher grade. One conclusion is that increased parental involvement with schools is necessary. Included are four references and appendices containing the survey instrument, responses, and survey results dissemination data. (MLH)",

Its elements include external environmental scanning, internal capacity analysis, participation and involvement, mission and strategic goals, implementation/linkage plans, and monitoring and assessment. This monograph addresses the need for strategic planning in restructuring education to accommodate the societal changes brought about by information technology. After an introductory overview, the paper addresses the use of strategic planning at the state level, suggesting that such planning must be coordinated at three levels of state leadership: state policy, state program management, and state leadership. A  typical model of strategic planning involves five phases of effort: (1) planning to plan and establishing a climate for change; (2) developing the strategic plan; (3) developing implementation plans; (4) implementing and monitoring plans; and (5) renewing the strategic plan. A brief concluding section discusses strategic thinking and the implications of strategic planning and related management techniques for state policy, effective management of state agencies, the state support system for leadership development, training in change management, and building statewide consensus. Appended is a discussion of strategic planning in the Appalachia Educational Laboratory's region. (TE)",

This paper presents some observations, culled from various reports, for policymakers' consideration. Section I offers a set of general observations from the literature: (1) dropouts are the most visible segment of the many children not succeeding in school; (2) problems like teen pregnancy and parenting, depression, suicide, substance abuse, and family instability complicate the issue; (3) schools' root problem may be their unappealing atmosphere; (4) schools are not organized to produce educated, self-motivated workers; (5) policy solutions will depend on an  overlap between educational research and successful practice; and (6) the opportunity and commitment to reshape schooling has never been greater. Next, vehicles to guide policy-making, including necessary vision, knowledge, multiple perspectives, active roles for affected persons, incentives for creative problem-solving, a judicious mix of mandates and assistance, and leadership and analysis, are discussed. Section III summarizes current state or island initiatives dealing with technical asssistance, program and performance mandates, financial aid, task forces, and governors' initiatives.

        "description":"Since 1951, Federal impact aid payments under P.L. 81-874 have been made to local educational agencies (LEAs) for (1) the education of pupils residing with parents who live and/or work on federal property or have a parent in the uniformed services of the United States; and (2) for the loss of tax revenue attributable to the Federal Government's purchase of land. In fiscal year 1987, section 3 (education of pupils) payments were $663 million and section 2 (loss of tax revenue) payments were $22 million. The 100th Congress is considering this program's reauthorization. This paper summarizes the payment procedures, participation levels, and proposed reauthorization options. Under the formula for calculating section 3 payments, the three principal factors are the LEA's local  contribution rate, or payment per pupil amount; types of pupils eligible for payment; and payment index (extent of burden) for each type of pupil. Annual appropriations acts for the Department of Education have placed further constraints on impact aid payments. Legislative proposals have been presented by the Administration and the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools, the principal membership group representing LEA's receiving impact aid payments. Options may be classified under five categories: method for counting pupils, payment amounts per pupil, supplemental funding, thresholds for LEA payment eligibility, and program administration. Included is an appendix explaining categories of federally connected students. (MLH)",

In this review of five recent research studies on the subject of self-esteem, one example of a successful program aimed at raising students' self-esteem is offered by Scarborough school system in Ontario, Canada. In two other studies, coming from different perspectives, Martin Covington and Jerry Conrath independently conclude that the best way for a child to sustain confidence is to acquire and demonstrate competence. In a comprehensive review of self-esteem enhancement programs, Mary Ann Scheirer and Robert Kraut reinforce this conclusion. The fifth entry raises questions of value and motivation that are often ignored,  suggesting that self-esteem is necessary, but not sufficient, for achievement, and that students need to see the value of education for themselves.

        "description":"For the past 2 years, the Regional Laboratory for Educational Improvement of the Northeast and Islands has produced issue synopses for distribution to policymakers in New England, New York, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The purpose of these publications is to acquaint policy makers and their staffs with the major educational issues their colleagues in neighboring states or islands have been acting upon. This synopsis is divided into two sections. The first provides a brief overview of the major issues confronting most of the jurisdictions in the region as well as actions that have been or will be undertaken to address those issues. The major issues covered in the overview include (1) at-risk youth; (2) teacher development; (3) drug, sex, and health education; (4) school  improvement; (5) early childhood education; (6) accountability; (7) certification; (8) school finance; and (9) teacher supply and demand. The second section, organized alphabetically by topical area, presents more specific information on action taken by states or islands regarding a particular issue from September 1986 through August 1987.

        "description":"This pamphlet discusses group problem solving in schools. Its point of departure is that teachers go at problems from a number of different directions and that principals need to capitalize on those differences and bring a whole range of skills and perceptions to the problem-solving process. Rather than trying to get everyone to think alike, principals should take advantage of the holistic approach of the idealists, the analysts' power of logic and deduction, the realists' ability to keep the situation in perspective, the pragmatists' drive to find the shortest route to the payoff, and the synthesists' gifts for creative speculation. A basic attraction of group processes is that one can reap the benefits of both convergent and divergent thinking, and both the analytical and the  intuitive. One of the obvious advantages of group problem-solving over individual effort is that the alternative suggestions generated by a committed group will almost always be greater in number and richer in creativity. These ideas are illustrated by a series of hypothetical examples and anecdotes. (TE)",

        "description":"This \"fastback\" outlines the steps to take in computerizing school administration. After an introduction that lists the potential benefits of microcomputers in administrative offices, the booklet begins by delineating a three-step process for establishing an administrative computer system: (1) creating a district-level committee of administrators, counselors, librarians, special education teachers, at least one computer expert, and other end-users to identify school administrative functions best suited for computerization; (2) to locate appropriate computer software to accomplish the administrative tasks that have been identified; and (3) to select the hardware that will run the software that has been chosen. The second chapter, selecting software, discusses stand-alone versus  integrated programs, disk operating systems, word processing, database management, spreadsheets, accounting, data analysis and graphics, and special applications. The third chapter, selecting hardware, discusses 8-bit machines, 16-bit machines, computer power, peripheral devices, and vendors. The final chapter addresses the problem of getting started and discusses consultants, establishing priorities, staff training, and the logistics of transferring to a computerized system. (TE)",

This &quot;fastback&quot; presents a conceptual model for invitational education and suggests some practical strategies for making schools the most inviting place in  town--intellectually, psychologically, and physically. Part 1 describes the assumptions, elements, and theoretical foundations of invitational education.

This research led to a hypothesis that teaching characteristics can be associated with career development stages. In phase I of this study (conducted in 1983) 145 principals from 2 midwestern states were surveyed on the question of career stages. Their responses yielded 161 characteristics which they felt differentiated one instructional stage from the other. These characteristics were then used as the basis for phase II of the study, in which 50 high school principals from each of six states in the mid-south were surveyed to determine if teaching characteristics indicating teacher efficiency could be consistently associated with  various stages of career development (analysis was based on results from 103 respondents). The subjects were requested to assign items on the survey to corresponding levels of experience they thought described teachers at certain stages of their career. Results of this study supported the proposed hypothesis and may be used to identify teachers who need staff development. However, further research is necessary to more thoroughly validate the model.

        "description":"Instructional leadership is one of the most important roles of supervisors. Supervisors lead other teachers in instruction to make them as effective as possible. They also lead teachers in developing and implementing an effective plan of instrution. The increasing complexity of teaching demands more help from supervisors and thus increases the complexity of the leadership role. Supervisors have to adapt to meet the needs of the people and the particular environment rather than practice a normative kind of leadership. Further, they must develop solutions for each individual problem as it arises rather than use \"prefabricated\" answers for any problem. Supervisors actively participate in the school's instructional program; for instance, they constantly evaluate the program and work  with teachers so as to get the best results with students. Instructional leaders improve the quality of instruction by furthering professional growth for all teachers; in-servicing contributes toward accomplishing this end. Supervisors should be flexible enough to deal with any situation and should maintain a good relationship with their staff. For example, they should consider teacher input; help teachers to do their job; listen to and empathize with teachers concerning their problems; facilitate communications; and alleviate anxiety. The characteristics of good supervisors are originality, popularity, sociability, good judgment, good humor, cooperativeness, and the ability to inspire trust; however, the improvement of instruction is the first priority.

        "description":"Just as superiors influence subordinates, subordinates may influence superiors. This study scrutinizes the relationship between the techniques of influence used by subordinates and the way in which the subordinates view their superiors' leadership styles. Questionnaires were sent to 250 randomly selected administrators of hospitality education programs (out of a possible 370) in two- and four-year higher education institutions in the United States. A total of 157 surveys were returned, of which 144 were usable, for an overall return rate of 57.6 percent. These subjects were chosen because they also function as department heads of a clearly defined sub-unit of a college or university. The supervisors influenced by the department heads included deans, directors, and chairpersons.  The Methods of Upward Influence instrument assessed upward influence methods and their frequency of use; the Perceived Leadership Style instrument gathered data regarding the subjects' views of their supervisors' leadership styles. The results revealed that the main methods of upward influence used by the department heads were reason and coalition. Reason employs facts and rational arguments to substantiate requests; coalition obtains the support of other members of an organization, such as faculty members, to exert upward influence. Treatment of the survey data suggests that subordinates are less likely to use assertiveness and higher authority (influencing the supervisor by appealing to someone at a higher level) to influence supervisors who clarify roles in achieving goals and who  consider their subordinates' welfare. Reason seems to be a preferable method when good relationships exist between the subordinates and their supervisors. Forty-three references and three tables are included. (RG)",

The four sites of the documented observations are a middle school with 480 students in a suburb west of Boston; a K-6 school in northeastern Massachusetts; a large city middle school  with 730 students; and a middle school with 800 students in a middle class suburb. The principals could be observed to use two types of strategies; one strategy stressed curriculum development, and the other emphasized enabling actions.

More visits to principals to validate the study and staff development to train principals in employing the skills are recommended. (RG)",

Cultural awareness is also important because culture influences the making and implementation of decisions. Two major research views regarding organizations and organizational culture have developed. First, the functional view regards organizational values as absolute, culture as an ontological entity, and culture as a product of the organization. Here, researchers examine causal laws, observable behaviors, and organizational structures. By contrast, the interpretive approach regards organizations as cultures that subjectively create their own realities. Here, researchers assess how personnel interpret their  organizations. Under the interpretive paradigm, three facets of culture furnish a framework for interpreting culture in organizations. The structural facet concerns the ways in which organizations perform their activities; the environmental facet concerns the context of people, events, demands, and constraints; and the value facet concerns the beliefs, norms, and priorities held by personnel. Administrators and researchers should analyze culture in their own organizations to reduce conflict and to promote the sharing of goals. Appended are 34 references. (RG)",

        "description":"This descriptive study examined the interaction between 25 mentally retarded (MR) adult participants in a physical education setting and 51 physical education majors. The study was designed to identify and analyze the causal attributions of physical education majors concerning MR adults' motor performance, to identify and analyze the causal attributions of MR adults concerning their own motor performance, and to examine the expectancies of both physical education majors and MR adults for future success of MR adults' motor performance. Written questionnaires completed by physical education majors indicated that physical education majors' primary causal categories were unstable, internal, and controllable; and their expectancies appeared to vary according to MR adults' performance.  In interviews, MR adults reported the causal categories of effort and intrinsic motive most often; their overall causal dimensions were stable, internal, and uncontrollable; and their expectations were significantly more positive than negative for future success on motor performance.

        "description":"The cohort of deaf students attending Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) from 1976-1980 were grouped into three categories, depending on their educational environments during matriculation: students registered in programs at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID); in programs both at NTID and in at least one of the other colleges of RIT; and in programs only in other RIT colleges. Analysis of student differences based on category indicated that: (1) significant differences were evident in entering achievement skills among the three categories, with students enrolled only at NTID having the lowest measured achievement skills; (2) rates of achieving some level of certification differed among the three categories; (3) students who received Bachelor of Science  degrees after majoring in both NTID and another college of RIT took a significant amount of technical and basic skills coursework at NTID to qualify for coursework in the other colleges; and (4) students receiving higher levels of certification (associate and bachelor degrees) obtained better and higher paying jobs. Overall, at least 97% of deaf RIT students required extensive remedial education, systematic alterations to the delivery of instruction, and other services offered through NTID to enable them to receive a college degree.

        "description":"The 2-year study investigated the use of word processing technology with 36 learning disabled (LD) intermediate grade children and 9 remedial teachers in five Massachusetts school districts. During the first year study staff documented how word processing was being used. In the second year, word processing activities hypothesized to be the most effective were designed and tested. Analysis resulted in a model of writing instruction with LD students and a set of student case studies which demonstrate the intersection of particular teaching approaches, the word processor, and individual LD writers. Results are interpreted in terms of: LD children's writing strengths and problems; LD students and machine skills; unique feature of word processing; instructional approaches; and most  effective approaches. Of three teaching approaches--substantive instruction, procedural instruction, and direct instruction--procedural instruction in which teachers provided students with strategies for generating ideas was the most effective. The writing model suggests that all three instructional approaches have an appropriate time in the writing cycle with procedural instruction having direct effects on productivity, a sense of ownership of the writing, and metacognitive awareness. Also included is the handbook of writing activities which developed out of this research and which include using the computer as a journal, using dialogue to write stories, using interviewing to tell other people's stories, and responding in writing to contemporary events.

Responses by June Mullins and Anne L. Corn address the  limits of educational responsibility by special education teachers and issues of special concern to teachers of blind and low vision children. Lawrence A. Scadden describes the impact of technology on visually impaired children and youth, while Gail McGregor focuses on the use of technology in educational programs for multiply handicapped students.

The time delay technique provided a means by which &quot;cognitive organizers&quot; could be taught to the students to mediate their behavior and improve academic performance. A modified multiple baseline alternating treatments design was used with junior high subjects in four special education classrooms, with each classroom having between 12 and 15 students. During the experimental phase of verbal prompt and time delay, the daily percentage of accurate oral student responses increased significantly over the baseline phase. Removing the verbal prompt and simply delaying student responses did not adversely affect accuracy. The study concluded that  time delay can be a viable means of increasing response accuracy in moderately mentally retarded adolescents. The verbal prompt was needed only as a means of establishing stimulus control for the time delay technique. (JDD)",

In addition to providing access, they also need to ensure that handicapped individuals are accommodated in the social and educational environment of college. However, it appears that the environment has not sufficiently been adapted to their special educational needs, as large percentages of deaf persons and unknown percentages of other handicapped groups withdraw from colleges and universities without graduating. These findings have a theoretical base in the predictive theory of the persistence/withdrawal process, which indicates that attrition rates will be much higher when low levels of student social and  academic integration exist. There is a need for more reliable data on attrition rates; and causes of attrition must be determined, considering such factors as learning disabilities of the handicapped, mobility problems, and communication problems. Institutional researchers must be prepared to describe the dimension of enrolled handicapped persons, their attrition rates, and their use of essential services. Then subgroups of the college population that have unacceptable rates of withdrawal can be identified and plans can be made to meet their special needs. (JDD)",

Life history interviews were conducted with 25 graduates of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. The respondents described experiences of alienation which recurred over a lifetime of interactions with hearing people. Respondents frequently described themselves as isolated within their family, due to poor sign language skills of family members. During their school years, the interviewees continued to experience social rejection and isolation in interaction with hearing peers and found social acceptance and community with deaf peers. They  later faced social alienation in their interactions with hearing people at work, while experiencing companionship and shared identity through relationships with deaf people in the community. Interviewees turned to deaf people in order to meet specific needs which were not met through interactions with hearing people: real conversation, information, close friendships, and a \"family\" relationship. An interactionist approach to understanding deaf community illustrates that, through accommodation and a greater acceptance of individual differences, the larger community can embrace all its members.

Questionnaires were completed by almost 4,000 graduates of 27 educational programs for deaf students in 21 states. Results showed that: (1) Within 10 years of their graduation from high school, approximately 50% of all deaf high school graduates had participated in some form of postsecondary education. (2) There was a considerably lower labor force participation rate and a higher unemployment rate within the deaf population compared to the hearing population 1 year after graduation; these differences were  less at 10 years after graduation. (3) While the occupational and earnings differences between the employed hearing population and employed deaf persons 10 years after graduation were not as severe as differences 1 year after graduation, a discrepancy did persist. (4) High school graduates who did not attend college had higher unemployment rates, were employed in blue collar jobs more often, and earned significantly less than those completing degree programs.

Results showed that deaf adults with degrees fared much better in the work force than did deaf high-school graduates in a number of ways: (1) Their unemployment rates were substantially lower.

Deaf adults without college degrees and those with Bachelor degrees showed little vertical mobility; those with sub-Bachelor degrees showed some gains over a 15-year period, probably due to entering occupational areas with career ladders.

It was learned that respondents encountered such challenges to their academic success as teachers who were unaware of or unresponsive to the needs of deaf learners and difficulties associated with group discussion and team projects. The students used a variety of formal and informal strategies to meet these challenges, including professional support services, networking with hearing students, informing teachers of their special needs, and staying after class for help. Some students appeared more skilled than others at assessing the academic environment and using  the full range of formal and informal supports available to them. The quality of social interaction experienced by respondents in the mainstreamed high school varied widely. Some felt they enjoyed a good social life, participating in sports and social activities, while others felt lonely and left out. These data suggest that social mainstreaming may be more difficult to achieve than academic mainstreaming. Recommendations for program development are provided. (JDD)",

        "description":"Twenty students were interviewed after transferring to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) from colleges that offered no specialized programs for hearing-impaired students. The students reported that previous teachers were not aware of their learning needs, reading materials were difficult to comprehend, classes were too large and fast-paced, and support services were inadequate. Students chose NTID because of its wide range of educational programming in technical fields, its reputation for providing a good education, and the unique social environment with both hearing-impaired and hearing students. The students felt that NTID teachers understood the needs of deaf learners and that classes were small and slower-paced, focused more on applied rather than  theoretical instruction, and used easier reading materials. Based on information from the interviews and supported by findings from other research, a postsecondary educational model is proposed that provides a continuum of educational opportunities, ranging from the &quot;special&quot; classroom to a totally mainstreamed environment with only basic communication supports required by the student. Elements highlighted in the model include teacher-student interaction and modified curricula, class size, support services, and the size of the hearing-impaired student body. (JDD)",

Graduates provided information about their postsecondary labor force activities, employment, occupations, earnings, and continuing educational pursuits. Results for this sixth annual survey are summarized as follows: Labor force participation rates of the most recent classes have increased 3.5 percent over the past three surveys, while rates among older graduates were slightly decreased. Unemployment rates for respondents were two to three times higher than the national average, depending on age group, and more respondents were employed part-time than in  previous surveys. Males were primarily employed as &quot;operatives, fabricators, and laborers,&quot; and secondly in &quot;technical, sales, and administrative support&quot; occupations. Females were also employed most often in these two categories, but in reversed order. Relative to national median weekly earnings, male and female respondents earned an average of $108 and $56 less per week, respectively. Further education of some kind had been or was currently being pursued by over 60 percent of the respondents. Increases were cited in both supplemental security insurance and vocational rehabilitation assistance. (JDD)",

The majority of the 273 respondents, who responded repeatedly to surveying from 1981 to 1985, were between ages 20 and 25.

Results included the following: At 1 year, 10 percent of the graduates had engaged in some type of continuing education, and by 5 years, over 60 percent had done so. Seventy-five percent of the respondents' degrees were earned in occupational areas, primarily in mechanical and engineering technologies and data  processing. Labor force participation rates were approximately 10 percent below national rates for the same ages. Unemployment rates averaged 30 percent across all the surveys. Respondents were primarily employed in the manufacturing sector, followed by professional and related services and the retail trade industry. Mean weekly earnings increased over time and as educational level increased, although increments were small. (JDD)",

A national program is proposed in the context of a generic definition of chronic childhood illness, emphasizing coordinated regional efforts which provide services as close to a child's home as possible. The report analyzes problems and recommends improvements in organization of services, costs and financing, educational and related services, basic research, and training of health professionals. Among detailed recommendations for change in existing programs are the development of regional data systems, individual service plans, and insurance coverage options that permit financing of a broad and continuing range of services.  Education-related recommendations include the adoption of more flexible policies regarding qualifying for homebound and hospital instruction. Continuing support for research is seen as a high priority, particularly in genetics, the development of new technologies, epidemiology, and family coping and adjustment. Increased attention to the problems of childhood chronic illness is needed in all health professional schools, emphasizing longitudinal experience with families of chronically ill children, collaboration among disciplines in working with families, and a broad definition of and approach to child and family needs.

Individuals have the right to contest their placement on this specialized unit. The need for bathrooms in single cells used in time-out procedures, as well as the need for increased staffing on the segregated unit, are noted. Mentally retarded inmates retained in the general prison population may participate in such specialized programs as compensatory or adult basic  education, hortitherapy, activity therapy, arts and crafts, anger management, and individual psychotherapy. An Orientation and Adjustment group is designed to provide the inmate with general knowledge about the institution, the function of personnel and facilities, possible job training, and basic skills such as hygiene. A support group provides reinforcement and peer support for the behaviors learned in Orientation and Adjustment. (JW)",

A longitudinal study involving 367 subjects, aged 17-18, tested the interactional model to determine the relative contributions of these factors during infancy, preschool, and elementary school years to a variety of adolescent outcomes. Patterns of individual characteristics and environmental process variables were found to be predictive of several adolescent outcomes. Early biological factors and the child's health and early temperament were predisposing for the adolescent mental health problems of depression,  aggressive and nonaggressive conduct disorders, and hospitalization for psychological treatment. The effects of later familial, social, and cognitive factors were even more important in shaping educational outcomes. In other outcomes, such as substance use, delinquency, and alternate living situations, the early predisposing factors shared equally with the elementary school variables in explaining the outcomes.

The experimental group consisted of 32 SLD individuals and the control group consisted of 32 SLD individuals from two non-demonstration school districts. The project's intervention involved a comprehensive SLD assessment, interdisciplinary team planning, individualized service plans, program preparation, and curriculum modifications. At team meetings, assessment results were reported, transition needs were identified, and an individual transition plan was developed for each subject, outlining recommended  services and a timeframe. In-service training and technical assistance were provided to community agencies, postsecondary institutions, and school sites to instruct staff to accommodate the learning-disabled subjects in their programs. An evaluation component of the program determined that: (1) project participants who carried out their transition plans more often reported benefits from the project in the areas of job search, job satisfaction, college admission, increased self-confidence, etc., and (2) parents viewed the project as helpful to their children and indicated that the project enhanced their awareness of the availability of funds, services, and transition programs for learning-disabled students. At the time of the follow-up survey, the participants had a higher full-time  employment rate and lower part-time employment rate than the control subjects. (JDD)",

        "description":"Students earning a Master's Degree in Special Education in 1985 at West Virginia University were surveyed concerning their job satisfaction and their teacher training programs. The majority of the 54 respondents found special education to be a personally satisfying career and believed that their individual efforts made a difference. However, many felt less than prepared for the stresses associated with their teaching positions and that they would select another profession if given the opportunity to begin again. Barely a third planned to remain in the field until retirement. The stress-training correlation varied depending upon the categorical training and teaching area involved, such as behavior disorders, learning disabilities, mentally impairments, or severe and profound  handicaps. The apparent contradiction in the expressions of job satisfaction with plans to leave the profession are attributed to factors external to the special education teacher's control, such as discipline, recordkeeping, and relationships with administrators. In order to retain special education teachers, it is suggested that teacher training programs place added emphasis on the following areas: adapting curriculum to meet individual students' needs, teaching strategies, and classroom management. It is also recommended that training programs better prepare teachers to handle job stress factors. (JDD)",

        "description":"Supported employment offers opportunities for severely disabled adults to carry out paid work at regular work sites within their communities and provides a path to normalization. Supported employment differs from traditional programs in that the positions are integrated into the community, skills are taught on the job, and support is need-based and ongoing. Service providers find job openings, identify the skills and abilities needed to do and hold each job, evaluate the skills and support needs of the person to be employed, match the person with a job, do on-the-job training, and provide ongoing evaluation and long-term job support. The three most popular kinds of supported employment positions are work enclaves, individual supported jobs, and mobile crews. This guide answers  parents' questions about the kinds of supported employment jobs, who pays for the support services, effects on Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance benefits, and necessary preparation for supported employment. An appendix contains directories of state-supported employment projects, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, and other resources, and outlines federal regulations for supported employment services.

        "description":"Concern about the possible bias of using only verbal assessments for the identification of intellectually gifted students led to an examination of the effect of incorporating nonverbal assessments of intelligence into the identification process. Two nonverbal instruments (Progressive Matrices and Test of Nonverbal Intelligence) were used in conjunction with three more traditional, verbally oriented measures (Slosson, Otis-Lennon, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised--WISC-R) in three separate populations of elementary-level students. One study focused on use of the Progressive Matrices in conjunction with the Slosson, the second compared the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence with the Slosson, and the third examined relationships between the Progressive Matrices and  the WISC-R and Otis-Lennon. Results demonstrated that correlations among all pairs of measures of intellectual functioning were generally low. The addition of a nonverbal measure to the identification process influenced between 6.9% and 28.6% of the giftedness assessments. Variability was a function of the particular combination of instruments used, the grade level at which identification occurred, and the way scores were used in decision-making. (Author/JDD)",

Among reported findings were that educable mentally retarded students were distinguished from other groups by low intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and overall academic achievement. The learning disabled group represented 74 percent of the total population, scored highest on all three IQ scores measured by the Wechsler scales, and were similar to the emotionally disturbed group on both cognitive and achievement measures. The emotionally disturbed group had slightly  higher reading scores than the learning disabled group. Learning disabled, mildly emotionally disturbed, and orthopedically handicapped groups performed similarly on cognitive and achievement measures. Nine data tables are included. (JW)",

A checklist developed by the investigator was used to record observations based on six categories of speech acts: commenting, answering, affirming, denying, directives, and other. Children were observed in their classrooms during free play and while engaged in both large and small group activities. Marked differences in pragmatic language skills of the two groups were observed. The nonhandicapped children used more speech acts that gave control and direction to their conversation. By contrast, speech acts of the mildly retarded children were generally reactive in nature, characterized by  high rates of answering, affirming, and denying. Differences in types of directives were noted: nonhandicapped children used questions, while the handicapped children used short and repetitive imperatives. Type of activity also led to observed differences. The handicapped children were observed to be more comfortable speaking in settings which gave structure to their conversation, while the nonhandicapped children appeared to be more at ease talking in loosely structured activities.

The project first reviewed furniture currently available for the physically handicapped and then conducted ergonomic research concerning the design of a computer table for the target population. Also considered were the types of wheel chairs (Amigo, manual driven, electric motor driven) and the physical characteristics of each chair in terms of door clearance, wheel height, arm rest clearance, etc. A pilot study was conducted during a summer school computer literacy class for the physically handicapped to determine the physical access problems  encountered by the students and teachers. The final design of the table incorporated the previous research. The paper includes shop drawings, specifications, and design criteria at each decision point. The resulting design is defended in light of the systematically identified criteria.

The technique not only focuses on learning a second language, but on using that language as a medium to learn mathematics, science, social studies, and other academic subjects. Although this approach has been used for many years in adult, professional, and university education programs for foreign students, content-based ESL programs at the elementary and secondary school levels are just emerging. One of the reasons for the increasing interest among educators in developing content-based language instruction is the theory that language acquisition is based on input that is meaningful and understandable to the learner. Content-based ESL programs have been  developed to provide students with an opportunity to develop their cognitive academic language proficiency, as well as to provide a less abrupt transition from the ESL classroom to an all-English-medium academic program. Content-based ESL courses provide instruction in the special language of the subject matter, while focusing attention as much or more on the subject matter itself. Examples of content-based instruction include: (1) mathematics, where communicating mathematical processes, concepts, and applications in English is emphasized; (2) science, where students learn to think, observe, classify, compare, communicate, measure, infer, predict, and identify space and time relationships in English; and (3) social studies, where students develop critical concepts in order to better  understand the history and culture of the United States, as well as develop their cognitive skills.

Many have lost language skills due to a lack of a linguistically appropriate environment in which to use a particular language. Millions of individuals who have studied a second language in high school or college for several years have lost the ability to hold the most basic conversation, while others who as children or young people were monolingual speakers of other languages are now monolingual speakers of English, for they are no longer able to speak their mother tongue. Language acquisition and maintenance depend on a variety of factors including the following: (1) instructional factors that relate to the way in which the language is initially acquired, including  instructional objectives, intensity of instruction, developmental considerations, and curriculum design; (2) cultural factors that relate to how public attitudes toward bilingualism and the relative prestige of different languages influence the maintenance of a particular language; and (3) personal factors that have related and correlated certain personality traits positively with success in learning foreign languages. Language study that helps the student to use the personal and cognitive strategies used by &quot;expert learners&quot; will enhance the likelihood of language skill maintenance; courses of study in which positive cultural attitudes are fostered and in which maintenance techniques are incorporated will help to prevent attrition.

        "description":"The language minority and limited-English-proficient students attending American schools in increasing numbers must be prepared as well as possible for their continued education in the mainstream. This can be begun by implementing mainstreaming procedures that fairly and accurately determine student readiness for learning in the mainstream and making recommendations toward that end, treating the process as a set of placement procedures. These procedures would include defining what the various placement decisions are, determining student needs and other information needed to make those decisions, developing and implementing procedures and instruments for gathering the information, and collecting, analyzing, and interpreting it. The apparent simplicity of the steps masks complexity  resulting from the interplay of variables such as program size and structure and the intricacy of individual linguistic, cognitive, and sociocultural backgrounds. Small teams of individuals from both bilingual/English-as-a-second-language and mainstream programs could have responsibility for making placement decisions. (MSE)",

        "description":"Research on second language learning suggests that age or age-related factors are a major variable in the acquisition of a second language for school. In the early stages of acquisition, older students are faster and more efficient learners, with the advantage of more advanced cognitive development in the first language. This early advantage diminishes after the first year of second language learning for adults, but remains for older children and adolescents. Adolescents past puberty are likely to retain an accent but are capable of developing complete second language proficiency. When schooled only in the second language, students in the 8-to-12-year range on arrival may be the most advantaged learners of school skills in the second language. Older students have less time to  make up lost years of academic instruction easily. The effect of age diminishes over time as the learner becomes more proficient in the second language. Differences are generally found through the first five years after arrival. It takes language minority students in any type of program a minimum of four years to reach native speakers' level of school language proficiency and may take eight or more years, depending on a variety of factors.

        "description":"The convergence of several lines of psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic research suggests possible explanations for age-related influences on language acquisition. These factors, which include cognitive development, sociocultural context, affective factors, and language input, can be helpful to language educators. By being alert to the cognitive variables active in children entering the classroom, educators can base instruction on what the individual learners are ready to accomplish. The experiences that a child has with language at home and in the community may influence later success in school and may be age-related. Mastery of different kinds of language use, or elaborated code, facilitates both language acquisition and academic achievement in general. Affective factors such  as motivation, anxiety, self-confidence, and other individual characteristics are seen by some as partially responsible for the differences between adult and child language acquisition. Finally, the nature of language samples presented to the learner as input for the acquisition process is a significant, age-related factor, since older learners receive less simplified input than do children and must develop skills in gaining needed linguistic information. Teachers following research in these areas are more likely to devise language teaching systems sensitive to the needs and potential of individual learners. (MSE)",

Discrepancies between these ideals and existing program characteristics persist. Research on effective program models reveals four types: social, information processing, personal, and behavioral systems models. Four program components, used in various combinations, appear to be necessary in an effective teacher  learning process: theory, demonstration, practice, and feedback. Five approaches based on cooperative professional development, each using teacher teams for feedback through social support, focus on professional dialogue, curriculum development, peer supervision, peer coaching, and action research. Training programs exemplifying these trends include the Multidistrict Trainer of Trainers Institute (California and New York), the Bilingual Education Training Institute (New Jersey Department of Education), and the Language Development Specialist Academy (Hunter College, New York).

These procedures form part of individuals' knowledge of how to negotiate meaning. It is proposed that a communicative view of the interactive nature of lexical negotiation requires that language instructors focus as much on procedures as on the more narrowly defined declarative meanings of words. This requires an approach to vocabulary development that is richer than traditional impoverished approaches that concentrate on building a store of definitional meanings. It is suggested that previously-developed theory on the four dimensions of communicative competence  (Canale and Swain, 1980) be used to create exercises that address these dimensions lexically as a prelude to task-based vocabulary learning. The use of several exercise types in the classroom is described. Eighty-one references are listed. (MSE)",

The test consisted of five item types: personal conversation, giving directions, description of picture sequences, topical discourse, and oral task completion based on printed instructions. Three preliminary forms of the test were administered to a group of language students and native speakers, and follow-up questionnaires elicited information about format and item preferences. Based on responses, minor changes were made in test items, timing, and instructions. Two versions of the test's taped portion, one in Brazilian and one in Lusitanian Portuguese, were made. A validation study assessed interrater reliability, interchangeability of the three test versions, and the comparability of responses to  the taped interview versus a live interview. Interrater reliabilities were found to be uniform across the test forms and live interview, and interrater reliability was not adversely affected by the semi-direct format. Feedback on test construction and difficulty was generally supportive, although most respondents preferred the live interview to the taped version. The test has been operationalized and is currently available. Development of similar tests for Hausa, Hebrew, and Indonesian will follow.

The ratings were paired for comparison and the pairs were categorized as being in perfect agreement, acceptable disagreement (indicating disagreement by one subdivision of the rating scale), or total disagreement. Over 41 percent of the paired ratings were found to be in perfect agreement, almost 45 percent were in acceptable disagreement, and less than 14 percent were in total disagreement.  The majority of disagreements were within a particular level rather than across levels. The results suggest a high degree of concordance between raters, with comparatively inexperienced raters reaching acceptable levels of agreement in most cases.

Consequently, the place of the teaching of grammar in the second language classroom is being questioned. Generally, much of the research seems to indicate that the teaching of grammar has little effect on the grammatical structures used by students except in controlled exercises. In many institutions of higher learning, the teaching of grammar has gone out of fashion. Class time is devoted almost entirely to providing comprehensible input, and if any grammar is given, it is given only for homework. A review of the pertinent literature suggests that further empirical research on  what actually happens in the classroom and on how learning is affected by grammar instruction is needed.

The analysis identifies what resources are available directly to students and how many dollars are available as a subsidy through the institution. The cumulative effects of the subsidies are evaluated to determine the degree to which the funds are equitably distributed among students from different income groups, racial and ethnic background, and ability levels. No attempt is made to determine the source of the subsidy, only the amount. Information is included as to whether the students are enrolled in a two-year public college, a four-year public college, or a  private college. Data sources are longitudinal data on the high school graduating class of 1980, the High School and Beyond study, and the Higher Education General Institutional Survey. The central concern is whether the average subsidies available to students are equitable. Study questions are: whether student aid subsidies are progressive relative to student income; whether institutional subsidies are neutral across income categories; and whether subsidies will be greater for students in private colleges than for those in public colleges. 11 references.

Consolidated governing boards were present in Florida, Idaho, and West Virginia, while coordinating boards were present in Alabama, Colorado, and South Carolina. Washington State had an advisory board. For each state, a background paper on the state system was prepared by a knowledgeable local person. Interviews with 15-20 key persons who had been involved in the evaluations were conducted. The following procedures to assess state agencies and state systems are examined: self-evaluation by the state board, performance audit/sunset reviews, special study groups or commissions, and comprehensive reviews and assessments. Conclusions include: state boards of higher education should engage in periodic self-evaluation  as a means of self-improvement and to ensure accountability to the state; the performance audit/sunset review should be attentive to broad questions of the boards' effectiveness in leading emerging state issues, particularly those related to quality and assessment; special studies can be a catalyst for change for some issues, but they are not a substitute for an ongoing evaluation process; and comprehensive assessments have been directed to obtaining accurate information about higher education performance and program effectiveness. 55 references.

        "description":"In 1979 the Institute of International Education (IIE), a nonprofit organization that works on education programs in 145 countries and with U.S. colleges and universities, began a scholarship program for black South Africans wanting to study in the United States. The models workshop, held at the offices of the IIE in 1987, was made possible by the cooperation of IIE and U.S. colleges and universities on the South African Education Program (SAEP). Five professionals representing different program models addressed issues related to the origins and implementations of their programs and associated problems. Ten respondents also participated. Two black South Africans involved in educational issues presented comments from the South African perspective on the issues raised. The workshop  explored the roles that U.S. colleges and universities play in offering educational opportunities to black South Africans. It looked at the many programs currently operating to see what works and what does not work. This report covers the following: developing links; problems in launching or implementing programs; reactions on U.S. campuses; consultation; and advice to others planning programs. Each section looks at correspondence/on site, career development, faculty fellowship, academic exchange, math/science teaching, discussion, and the South Africa perspective.

        "description":"A study examining the perceptions of career growth and aspirations of mid-level administrators in higher education was undertaken because, though there has been a large recent increase in the number and importance of mid-level administrators in higher education, the structure and nature of higher education organizations seem to constrain traditional career advancement opportunities for them. This is in part due to the few discernable career paths, the vague position hierarchy of status and prestige, the flat formal structure of the organization with few senior-level positions, and the non-tenure accruing nature of their positions. Also, many senior-level incumbents remain in those positions for several years. Limited research means it is not known whether the structural  constraints of colleges and universities adversely affect mid-level administrators. The concerns behind this paper are: (1) the perceived career aspirations of mid-level administrators; (2) the motivating factors influencing their career decisions; and (3) the organizational factors they perceive as facilitating and inhibiting their career development. Following a discussion of conceptual organization, the methodology is described in terms of data source and sample, research approach, and data analysis and interpretation. Findings focus on career aspirations, planning style, field identity, experience, personal factors, career orientations, and perceptions of the organization. Results indicate that it is crucial to identify career orientations in order to understand perceptions of career  growth, and that most participants find the work environment adequate or desirable. Organizational responsiveness may be the key to minimizing perceived barriers and creating renewed commitment and growth. Tables are included. Contains 18 references. (SM)",

Literature published in &quot;American Educational Research Journal&quot; (AERJ), &quot;Educational Researcher&quot; (ER), and &quot;Review of Educational Research (RER) is reviewed for the 10-year period ending in 1987. This kind of research technique has appeared frequently in educational literature. Periodic updates of recent literature with respect to methods used has an extensive history. A description of the methodology focuses on the coding process (reading each article to identify every research method or statistical technique used and categorizing all methods and techniques identified in each article) and the categories employed to code research  methods or statistical techniques used (descriptive, bivariate correlation, t-test, nonparametric, meta analysis, ANOVA/ANCOVA, psychometric theory, multiple correlation/regression, multivariate, factor/cluster, LISREL, Bayesian, simulation, modeling, and qualitative). The results of this study show the most frequent methods used in rank order for JEP are ANOVA/ANCOVA, bivariate correlation, t-test, multiple regression, multivariate, and nonparametric techniques and for AERJ are ANOVA/ANCOVA, multiple regression, bivariate correlation, descriptive, multivariate, nonparametric, and t-test. For the three journals combined, five of the seven most frequently utilized methods are taught in most two-course statistics sequences required for doctoral study; only multivariate and nonparametric  techniques are not covered comprehensively. Thus, it appears that graduate students are well-prepared and trained. Contains 11 references. Tables are included. (SM)",

        "description":"Selected reasons for resistance to change in education are discussed, the kinds of resulting behaviors are noted, and suggestions for plausible means of overcoming this resistance are offered. Though the search for excellence and innovation in education are desirable, they are often not sustained for any appreciable period of time and the innovations are often used in a limited manner. The use of computers in higher education is a recent example of this process in operation. Though computers have been widely applied, the potential has not been realized. Cost, lack of access to good software, and teacher resistance to the approach threaten the widespread implementation of computers. Resistance to change is discussed in detail, and resistant behaviors are explained. Such behavior  becomes evident when there is an attempt to introduce new methods of instruction in education. Both aggressive (directly attacking) and subtle (stalling for time) resistant behavior is found. Various steps for overcoming resistance are &quot;unfreezing&quot; the old attitude, changing, and refreezing the new attitude. Each faculty member's needs must be considered. Information regarding the innovation must go to all necessary people in a form that is uniquely meaningful to each. Some people may fear economic or job loss or loss of job status because of the innovation, so those introducing the innovation must be aware of these fears and must act in a nonalienating way. Information must focus on things in which the change will and will not result. Too often, the individual will progress to the point  of using the innovation, but not in a way that optimizes its potential. This individual must learn to network with others and engage in mutual sharing of ideas and potential uses. Success is based on individual efforts resulting from personal commitment to change.

The faculty evaluation plan was based on four principles: broad-based faculty and administrative support; informing faculty of expectations of them before the evaluation; providing a description of the primary decision-making and data-gathering roles played by students, faculty, and administration; and providing feedback and resources to assist faculty to enhance their performance and achieve their career goals. The evaluation plan includes independent ratings of faculty in four areas: teaching, research, service (external to the university), and academic citizenship (internal university service). Each of these areas has specific criteria for three possible ratings: basic  merit, superior merit, and exceptional merit. Each faculty member participates in weighing the categories each year. After the third year of use of the plan, there have been modifications in the rating scales, but the basic system remains unchanged. The specific rating scales for each category is appended, along with the reporting form used by faculty. (Author/SW)",

In addition to required courses in abnormal psychology, social psychology, applied research methods, and counseling, electives include traditional psychology courses such as personality and industrial psychology. Fundamental to the program is a strong interdisciplinary approach that blends business coursework and training in the social and  behavioral sciences. The cornerstone of the curriculum is a four-course counseling sequence designed to promote the development of basic brief counseling and referral skills.

The task force concludes that the purpose of the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program has changed significantly in the last decade. While originally established as a loan of convenience for middle-income students, the GSL program has become the primary federal program for access to postsecondary education for low-income students. It was found that defaulters tend to be first-year students, from low income and minority backgrounds, with a small loan balance (90% less than $5,000) who did not complete much more than the first year, have borrowed only once, receive no or little assistance from parents in repaying, are likely to be unemployed  when the loans come due, and never make a first payment. Increasing Pell grants and funding of the Student Support Services program to help retain high-risk students are recommended. The task force recommends that Congress adopt a consistent set of definitions that describe how defaults must be calculated so they can be uniformly used by all program participants. GSL program management initiatives are proposed for lender, borrowers, the Department of Education, guaranty agencies, and institutions. (SW)",

Consideration is given to the social environment for graduate and undergraduate students, ways to improve students' understanding of human sexuality, and the following personal and family policy issues: child care; leave for new parents; care of elderly and incapacitated relatives; the tenure probationary period; and flexible working hours, part-time work, and job sharing. For both students and employees, the issues of sexual harassment and homosexuality are considered.  Forty-two recommendations are offered by the Task Force on Marriage, Family and Other Life Commitments. Task force recommendations concerning alcohol use include the following topics: providing alcohol, residence halls, football and alumni weekends, and drunkenness. The Task Force on Teaching offers recommendations concerning staffing and initiatives at the university and departmental levels. The residentiality report covers staff positions and roles, support services, the residential environment, women and minorities, handicapped students, and facilities. (SW)",

Chapters cover the following: goals of student outcomes assessment; philosophy of assessment; outcome taxonomies; issues of measurement in talent development assessment; cognitive outcome instruments; increasing the usefulness of outcomes assessments; and practical suggestions for conducting assessments. It is suggested that an institutional program of assessing student outcomes should be based on a coherent philosophy of institutional mission and should reflect a conception of what constitutes effective performance of that mission. Two commonly used approaches to defining excellence are discussed, reputational and resource approaches, but a &quot;talent development&quot;  approach is proposed in which assessment focuses more on changes or improvements in students' performance from entry to exit. Talent development assessments may be conducted with either standard, commercially available assessment instruments or with locally designed instruments developed on campus. Reasons why assessments may not live up to their potential as management tools are addressed, including inadequate conceptualization or political barriers. Appended is a summary of the more than 25 cognitive assessment instruments discussed (general education tests, specific skills tests, and subject matter competency).

(The formative evaluation plan for the rough-cut pilot has been replicated for  the final version of the television program.) Pretest-posttest performance by 300 students demonstrated a significant increase in achievement of the learning objectives.

Specific microcomputer applications are described, i.e., the use of 512K Macintosh computer to facilitate the collection, analysis, and presentation of ethnographic interviews, naturalistic observations, historical documents, and tabular data. Software packages discussed in this context include MacWrite for word processing; FileMaker for creating databases; Multiplan to produce spreadsheets of tabular information; and MacDraw to produce graphs and  illustrations for the final research project. Sample output is shown. Also discussed are the potentials of Hypercard, a new software package implementing the concept of hypertext that will enable researchers to organize qualitative data in a relational database. It is concluded that the computer proved especially valuable for tracking themes and for text arrangement, and that it allowed the researcher to collect, analyze, and present the data more efficiently.

        "description":"The thinking processes of students of Logo were examined to identify programming problems and possible instructional remedies. Subjects were 11 students between the ages of 8 and 12 who had completed 5 weeks of Logo instruction. These students were given a series of five short programming problems highlighting such areas of difficulty as judging angles, deciding on the directions of turns, using a variable, and using a subprocedure. The data collected included notes taken by the experimenter recording program errors, attempted repairs, and code written by students. A coding system was used to provide a measure of students' successes and errors in terms of the number of elements in a program they programmed correctly and their problem-solving efforts. The success rate in terms of  elements correct was high, but success in terms of programs running successfully was lower, and a number of problems with what might be considered trivial aspects of Logo were recorded. A few students evinced serious problems with understanding tasks involving variables and a subprocedure. Possible explanations for the challenge of trivial elements of programming include: (1) the conjunctivity effect of minor problems; (2) a shortfall in elementary problem-solving strategies; (3) difficulty in discriminating concepts with superficial similarity; and (4) domain and domain operation problems. It is concluded that many trivial elements of Logo pose genuine conceptual difficulties, a problem that instruction must face and resolve. (25 references) (MES)",

The experimental group consisted of 6 teachers who taught 9 classes of a total of 132 high school students; the control group consisted of 9 teachers who taught 13 classes of a total of 239 high school students. Data collection included a student questionnaire on previous experience with computers, a pre/posttest to assess general cognitive skills at the beginning of the term and possible transfer effects at the end, classroom observations, an end-of-semester test on BASIC, and homework assignments. Analysis focused on teachers'  fidelity to the metacourse lessons, the impact of instruction on the students' mastery of BASIC, and the transfer of cognitive skills from programming to other domains. Results showed that teachers were faithful to the lessons and found them quite teachable. Experimental group students made significantly fewer errors on the test of BASIC and did significantly better on all major categories of problems. Evidence of transfer that was observed was limited to a particular problem similar to the programming tasks.

Researchers examined prime time television programs for a period from October 15 through November 19, 1987, for the following behaviors: (1) use of math; (2) reading; (3) positive references to religion; (4) cigarettes; (5) alcoholic drinks; (6) someone attacked; (7) someone shot at; and (8) someone killed. The incidence of these behaviors was correlated with the entire sample of programs, and with the sample representing the children's favorites. It was found that the occurrence of math was the only  similarity between the two sets of programs; the children's favorites had less violence, less drinking and smoking, and fewer positive references to religion than the total sample, but conversely, had more references to reading. The occurrence of these behaviors was also examined by time slot, and a relationship was found between the time of broadcast and the occurrence of drinking, smoking, and reading. The discussion summarizes these findings, and also considers the implications of these findings for parents of school age children. The text is supplemented by nine tables, and copies of the student questionnaire and the form used by observers to evaluate prime time programs for the eight behaviors are appended.

Although blacks were less likely to have home computers, black children who did have them used them more than white children. Survey data are presented in three text tables and five detailed tables. Appendixes provide additional tables and information on the survey itself, including its reliability and the survey instrument. (EW)",

        "description":"This study presents composite profiles of teachers who were interviewed in order to assess how they are being affected by the challenges and opportunities presented by computer technology use. In-depth interviews were held with 76 teachers from 10 sites around the country, and the interview data were analyzed to identify themes and to construct seven composite profiles of teachers who articulated those themes. The profiles present the following points of view: deciding not to use computers; looking forward to teaching with technology; using computers in an elementary classroom; using computers in special education; teaching computer science and computer literacy; integrating computers into the secondary mathematics curriculum; and training teachers at the district level. The  findings drawn from all the interviews address: (1) influences on teachers' decisions about teaching with technology, their beliefs, external mandates and opportunities, and access to resources and support; (2) effects of computers on teaching style, classroom management, and teachers' roles; and (3) resources and support teachers want, hardware and software, effective training and ongoing assistance, visions of teaching with technology, layers of administrative and technical support, and greater influence on educational technology policies, applications, and use. It is noted that these findings suggest that policy efforts focus on the computer as an instructional tool, and that an integrated system of resources is necessary to support such use. A copy of the telephone interview survey  instrument is appended. (76 references) (EW)",

The environment is based on a progression of increasingly sophisticated causal models that simulate domain phenomena, generate explanations, and serve as student models. Constraints on model evolution are discussed in terms of causal consistency and learnability, and a taxonomy of models useful for instruction is outlined. The design principles underlying the creation of one type of causal model (zero-order models for electrical circuit behavior) are given, and possible progressions with respect to model elaboration, order, and perspective are described in the context of presenting a theory of  model evolution. Finally, the architecture that enables the pedagogical tools of the intelligent learning environment is described, with an emphasis on the range of instructional interactions and learning strategies that can be supported.

Subjects were 40 elementary students (4th, 5th, and 6th grades), who were randomly assigned to either convergent or divergent software treatment. These students interacted for 25 hours with numerous software packages designed to encourage the thinking skills of their treatment. Three tests were then administered: Schaefer's Creative Attitude Survey, the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, and the Cornell Critical Thinking Test. As hypothesized, subjects in the divergent group scored higher than the convergent group on all 14 measures within the creative thinking test. However, only one of the 14 comparisons was at a  significant level. No differences were found on either the critical thinking test or the creative attitude survey.

The goal in developing IMTS was to generate instructional interactions from device models composed of instances of generic objects. Problem selection in IMTS relies on the use of a normative model that reflects the structure of the target device. Proficiency measures are maintained for each student in terms of this model and support the selection of problems of appropriate difficulty and type. IMTS incorporates a formulation of generic diagnostic expertise, termed Profile, that: (1) explains the significance of particular test outcomes and remediates student beliefs about symptom implications; (2) recommends what to do  next, taking completed tests into account; (3) assesses student proficiency; and (4) debriefs the students following each fault isolation exercise. A number of findings and recommendations concerning alternative approaches to simulation, student monitoring, problem selection, and student aiding are presented. The next steps for IMTS development are also outlined, including techniques for simulation devices whose complete functional behaviors cannot be reasonably specified, and the addition of features to support procedural training.

Cognitive and behavioral patterns used as dependent variables were cognition (reading scores, language use, general information, beliefs, reality-fantasy discrimination); imagination; comprehension of television content; waiting ability; physical aggression; and school behavioral adjustment. Home influences used as independent variables included family characteristics (parents' values, attitudes toward child-rearing and discipline, mediation styles, belief-systems, family structure, and daily lifestyle); and the television environment (average weekly viewing by parent and child, type of programming, emphasis on television,  television mediation, and rules). Data were gathered by questionnaires, interviews, and home recording devices. The first study involved predictions of behavior across several years from the independent variables. The second study was a shorter term prediction based on more extensive data collected from the children on their parents' behavior. Results showed that the family patterns relevant to the question of cognitive and behavior skills included parents who: value imagination and resourcefulness or responsibility and stability; do not emphasize power-assertive discipline; actively mediate the outside world through explanation and discussion; and watch less television themselves.

The study was based on data supplied by the libraries at the University of Chicago and Columbia University, the New York Public Library Research Libraries, and the Library of Congress, as well as site visits to each library, interviews with key personnel, detailed work logs kept during the first six months of 1986, and work sampling data collected during the same period. Considerable variation was found in the unit costs of the library-specific processes of decision making and preparation and review, with smaller variations in the costs of the  film work itself.

Six teaching/learning space topics are considered: (1) light and color; (2) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; (3) acoustical and background noise; (4) furniture and ergonomics; (5) electrical wiring and conduit requirements; and (6) computer requirements. The relationship of physical properties of learning facilities and behavioral science data is considered, and the specific environmental variables that influence the student--temperature and humidity, noise, light and color, seating  position, classroom design or openness, density and privacy, and the presence of windows--are discussed. Research findings on requirements for materials storage, minimum light for learning spaces, colors and learner activity, and ideal temperatures for student activities are summarized in four tables, and diagrams of classroom space configurations for various audiovisual media are provided.

It is noted that most ARL libraries have not yet conducted studies to project the extent of use of remote access, although it is a viable reality in more than half of them, and more respondents believe it is too soon or the issues are too complex to identify causal relationships between the introduction of remote access and changes in other library services.

Subjects were 18 college freshman attending branch campuses who were academically underprepared for college level study and who also lacked basic library skills. Eleven students were taught in the lecture group, and eight students in the CAI group. The CAI group used four floppy disks and an instruction manual which covered the card catalog, periodical indexes, newspaper indexes, and government publications indexes. In addition, the CAI group completed an attitude survey to measure the effectiveness of CAI as a teaching method. No significant differences were found between the previous library skills of the lecture group  and the CAI group, but the CAI group had both a significantly higher level of performance on a mastery test given after the completion of the instruction, and highly positive attitudes toward CAI as an instructional method. It is suggested that CAI should be considered for implementation when developing and/or revising library instruction programs even though other methods may be preferable in certain situations.

Study findings, extrapolated to the 121,100 students currently enrolled in such courses at Washington's 27 community colleges, indicate the following: (1) about 46,000 &quot;place-bound&quot; adults (i.e., those with full-time family or job responsibilities in addition to their college course work) enroll in academic and vocational courses each quarter, making up 35% to 41% of the total state enrollment; (2) most community college  students are employed, with nearly one-third working full time; (3) most community college students say their courses provide them with skills related to their current or future work, and nearly 80% see a direct relationship between their coursework and their jobs; (4) 62% to 68% of the students pay the entire cost of their education without the benefit of financial aid, loans, or scholarships; (5) of the nearly 20,000 students who enroll without a high school diploma or equivalent, half are enrolled in Adult Basic Education and English as a Second Language and half in academic and vocational classes; and (6) about 48,500 students enroll each fall quarter to prepare for transfer to four-year institutions. The survey report includes profiles of seven student types: students with family  incomes below the poverty level, transfer students, re-entry homemakers, single parents, students not completing high school before college, unemployed students, and life-long learners.

        "description":"In fall 1984, the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges implemented a new statewide occupational education program evaluation and reporting system, using information supplied by occupational education administrators, instructors, and advisory committee members. To collect the evaluation data, the 106 California community colleges were divided into four representative groups and all occupational programs were divided into four clusters, with one cluster to be evaluated each year. Data on programs targeted for the 1983-84 evaluation were collected from 80 colleges in fall 1984, while data for 1984-85 were collected from 64 colleges in spring 1985. Over the 2-year period, usable responses were received from 376 administrators, 1,355 instructors, and 675  program advisory committee members, assessing 830 of the estimated 3,723 occupational programs offered at the community colleges. Major findings included the following: (1) occupational education administrators pointed to the qualifications of instructional staff and special provisions for reentry as strengths of occupational education in California, while the use of student follow-up information and the numbers of instructors were seen as two areas needing improvement; (2) occupational education instructors found the qualifications of instructional staff and administrators to be strengths, while provisions in the capital outlay budget and the use of support staff were considered the areas that most needed improvement; (3) over 85% of the local program advisory committee members felt that  all instructors were competent to teach the subject and that program completers were able to perform successfully the duties required by employers; and (4) advisory committees perceived program needs in the areas of equipment and facility maintenance, safety standards, student follow-up, and labor market information. The administrator, instructor, and program advisory committee evaluation forms and detailed results are appended. (MDB)",

A study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of SLS 1101 in reducing attrition and increasing grade point average (GPA) over the course of a year.

Study findings included the following: (1) in comparison to students who did not enroll in SLS 1101, the SLS enrollees were more likely to be U.S. Black non-Hispanics of traditional college-going age  taking fewer than 12 credits and seeking an associate in arts degree; (2) in fall 1986, 67% of the SLS students were still enrolled at MDCC, compared to 46% of those who had not taken the course; (3) re-enrollment rates were consistently higher for the SLS students whether the comparison with non-SLS students was based on ethnicity, gender, number of credits taken, degree sought, or citizenship status; (4) at the end of the first semester, 68% of the SLS enrollees and 56% of the non-SLS students had GPA's of 2.0 or higher; however, by the end of the first year the gap between the two groups had narrowed to 60% vs. 56%; and (5) 75% of the SLS students felt they were more likely to survive at MDCC because of the course.

Research on the effects of working conditions on faculty attitudes has shown consistently that interaction with students and peers and privacy within the classroom are major sources of satisfaction, while faculty are less satisfied with the time available to them to prepare for class or keep up to date in their field, the lack of recognition for professional growth, and the lack of support for instruction. Other researchers have focused on the intrinsic variables affecting job satisfaction, showing how age, commitment to a community college career, and the emotional responses of faculty relate to work attitudes. Most  researchers are concerned with utilizing their findings to effect changes in the institutional environment that will prevent faculty stagnation and burnout and enhance creativity and vitality. Recommendations include encouraging diversity in faculty work tasks and the skills used to accomplish them, hiring faculty for 12 rather than 9 months, restructuring sabbaticals to promote retraining, and adjusting salaries and bonuses to recognize teaching excellence in tangible ways.

        "description":"Southside Virginia Community College (SVCC) operates the largest inmate education program in Virginia, offering associate degree programs and academic support at three correctional centers and plannning programs at two others. The program at Mecklenburg Correctional Center, which has the reputation for being one of the country's toughest prisons, has been in existence since 1984, employing a principal, five academic teachers, two vocational teachers, a librarian, and a library aide. The program opened never-before-used classrooms in the inmate living areas; instituted vocational and apprenticeship programs; and began a college program in cooperation with SVCC. Since the advent of the program, 208 inmates have earned a high school diploma and in spring 1988, the first  student-inmate earned an associate degree. As expected, the primary impact of the college program has been on the student-inmates. Participation in the program bestows status on the student-inmates, provides a positive direction to the lives of those serving lengthy terms, and has resulted in improved inmate behavior. Five elements key to the success of SVCC's program are cooperation with the Department of Correctional Education; an active and sympathetic administration; flexibility in meeting the needs and special restrictions of inmates; screening and orientation of instructors and students alike; and institutional support.

In fall 1986, 1,254 former PGCC students were enrolled as undergraduates at UMCP. Of these students, 83% were in good academic standing, 10% had received unsatisfactory performance warnings, and 7% were dismissed at the end of the semester. The mean cumulative grade point average (GPA) of the PGCC transfer students was 2.48, somewhat below the mean GPA of 2.54 averaged by all community college transfers at UMCP. The former PGCC students  had transferred an average of 43 credits to UMCP. An analysis of information concerning the 1,304 former PGCC students enrolled at UMCP in fall 1985 revealed the following: (1) 20% of the students were new to UMCP that fall, and more than 66% had been at the college for two years or less; (2) 46% of the students had transferred between 31 and 60 credits to the university; (3) 71% enrolled for 12 or more credit hours, with the remaining 29% attending part-time; (4) programs in business and social science were the most popular among the transfer students; (5) 81% of the transfer students were white; and (6) students who transferred more than 60 units had higher GPA's than students who transferred fewer than 60 units.

        "description":"This study, which focused on effects of child care on the workplace, addressed several questions: (1) What kinds of child care arrangements do employed parents make, and why do they make them? (2) Are these parents having difficulty finding child care? (3) Does their ability to manage child care affect their absenteeism and stress? (4) What roles do occupation and personnel policies play in this issue? The study was based on a May 1983 survey of a workforce of 20,000 from 33 companies and agencies chosen to represent a broad cross section of industries, occupations, and income levels in the Portland, Oregon, area. Participants included large and small manufacturing concerns, hospitals, service industries, and retail concerns, as well as several public agencies. Of the 8,121  employees who responded to the survey, 54 percent were women, 44 percent had children under the age of 18, and 30 percent had children under the age of 12. Findings, which mainly concerned families with children under 12, indicated that child care is hard to find and difficult to manage. Family structure and ability to arrange child care have an impact on the workplace in the form of absenteeism and stress. Company policies and work requirements also affect families, and employee stress level and ability to be at work. General recommendations are offered to employers. (RH)",

        "description":"The major purpose of this study was to determine what relationship currently exists between grade 1 marks and later school achievement. Complete academic records were obtained on two samples of students from rural towns in Southwestern Ontario. Each sample contained all the children born between 1964 and 1971 who attended their town's major public elementary school from kindergarten through grade eight, and then completed their secondary education in the town's only public high school. Each student's marks in language arts and mathematics were recorded from final report cards issued in grades one through eight. At the high school level, each student's final grade point average was used as the single measure of overall high school performance. Findings, which were similar to those  of research conducted more than two decades ago, indicated that children who experience considerable difficulty in mastering the grade 1 curriculum are likely to have serious learning problems well beyond their early school years. It is concluded that screening at the preschool level for the purpose of identifying children who are likely to have learning problems in grade 1 is clearly justified. (RH)",

Findings indicated that: (1) respondents were generally unaware of PT and its purpose; (2) very few attended PT courses; (3) respondents agreed that a great need for PT exists and that PT is of great value; (4) friends and relations were considered to be as effective a source of referral as advertisements and articles; (5) churches and clinics seemed to be the main PT organizers and social workers predominated as trainers; (6) people believed that  communication, teenage problems, school and learning difficulties, and sex education could be handled by PT; (7) more than half of the respondents claimed that they were not presently experiencing problems with their children; (8) only one quarter of Indian and Colored respondents reported knowing how to relax, while nearly one half of whites said they knew how; (9) one in four of the respondents requested information about parenting in general; and (10) the helping professions in the Republic of South Africa seemed to concentrate on treatment rather than prevention.

The framers of the Constitution saw a group of interdependent systems and devised three interdependent governmental systems that included legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The powers of each branch of government is naturally limited by the powers of the other two, and the liberty of one ends where the liberties of the others begin. Each government branch has a necessary duty and a contingent liberty. The other societal systems include economics, education, public  information, and transportation. Each system has its own duties and responsibilities. When one system intrudes upon another or intervenes in another system's activities, the balance of systems is disturbed. The natural order of systems needs to be studied in order to promote balance, harmony, and felicitous interaction among social systems. (JHP)",

Demographics combine demographic data with socioeconomic and geographic factors to help business and other managers know the market for the goods and services they offer. This guide explains market, product, and site analyses, discusses data sources and resources, and includes case studies involving the General Motors Corporation, Bell Atlantic, the Country Mart in Omaha, Nebraska, and Market Statistics, Inc. Post-war population trends have had an enormous impact on consumer and labor markets, bringing home to business the importance of taking advantage of demographic shifts. The baby boom created a 75-million-person &quot;bulge&quot; in U.S. age structure which affected school  systems, housing, and the job market. Another shift is that households have been growing more rapidly than the population, with individuals living alone and childless couples contributing much of the growth. Geographic patterns of regional distribution have also altered, with the South and West accounting for most of the U.S. population increase. Advances in computerized access to data describing these changes and increased consciousness of their economic significance have spurred the application of demographic knowledge by managers and the growth of the demographic information industry. This document describes the resources and methods of demographics, including the creation and use of demographic data products. (SM)",

        "description":"Recently, a United Nations study of 30,000 10- to 14-year-olds in nine countries ranked U.S. students next-to-last in their comprehension of foreign culture. Senator Robert Stafford of Vermont pointed out that the impressive array of witnesses before the committee indicated the need to increase geography literacy among young people. Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island announced that he, Senator Stafford, and New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley were introducing an amendment to provide teacher training and retraining in history and geography. Admiral Bobby Ray Inman stated that if the country cannot upgrade the quality of education, it is doomed for a continued downward slide. Warren E. Burger, former Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, stated that geography and history are so  interrelated that they cannot be logically separated. William J. Bennett, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, noted that in his visits to U.S. public schools, he was struck by the absence of maps in many classrooms. Senator Bill Bradley stressed that a fuller appreciation of the nation's history comes when a map of the United States is used. Other participants before the committee included Ronald Abler of the National Science Foundation, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president National Geographic Society, Nancy Nakayama, of the University of California, Congressman Leon E.

        "description":"This article presents a framework for considering the problems involved in developing and implementing more education programs in public secondary schools in the United States. Barriers that exist to moral education in the schools include political, philosophical, and pedagogical problems. The major political problems are those of public consensus and the incendiary nature of debate over values in schooling. Three philosophical reasons for the malaise in moral education are: (1) lack of consensus on a definition of moral education; (2) inability to verify moral claims; and (3) the issues of moral autonomy. As long as moral education's meaning remains elusive, schools will have difficulty establishing it as part of the curriculum. All the conventional disciplines speak  authoritatively to their topics, while moral education cannot point to an uncontested basis for validation. Many philosophers argue that moral judgments and actions are not fully developed unless they are freely chosen. Pedagogical barriers to moral education include: (1) problems in defining how moral education fits into the curriculum; (2) lack of relevant preparation in pre-service teacher education; and (3) lack of clear criteria or assessment devices for measuring the success of moral education.

Students at any grade level can do surveys involving problem-solving in social situations. A creative homework assignment may be one in which students learn about some local, state, national, or international problem by interviewing their parents, neighbors, or city officials. Another way to encourage creativity is to have  students work together in research projects that culminate in oral reports. Creative homework often involves the process of analysis.

Infertility can have far-reaching effects on life satisfaction, well-being, and psychological adjustment. This paper presents an analysis of sex and intimacy among infertile couples based on the qualitative analysis of intensive interviews conducted with 22 infertile couples in western New York. One-half of the people in the study reported that their marriages had become closer rather than more distant because of the experience of infertility. A major reason for the high level of perceived closeness is the high level of communication required for a couple to deal with infertility. Thus, while infertility introduces  tensions into a relationship, working out the problems arising from the infertility leads to most of these couples achieving a closer relationship. (Author/SM)",

They may begin to believe nothing can be done to ensure the survival of the world. If minorities are invisible in the curriculum, children will believe that difference and otherness must be shunned. Curriculum developers who are willing to reconceptualize have the opportunity to interpret diversity of culture and experience so that children learn from and appreciate their own culture, while at the same time affirming and learning from the cultures of other people.

This booklet was developed to contribute to the understanding of the complexities of the situation in relation to Iran's future and U.S.--Iranian relations. The booklet contains three parts that include: (1) the revolution; (2) the question of succession; and (3) U.S. policy options. The revolution had widespread support due to countrywide opposition to the royal regime. The liberal leaders of the revolution accepted the charismatic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini because of the powerful appeal of his personality. The revolution quickly polarized between the liberal reformists and the revolutionary religious elite. With the passing of Khomeini from the political  scene, the dedication to achieving a consensus government based on Islamic ideology will subside. A struggle for leadership will occur, and a major effort will be made by the victors to achieve strong central control of the government and its institutions. Iran is militarily significant to the United States in containing the southward expansion of the Soviet Union. But the vicissitudes of U.S. policy toward Iran suggest that there has been no crystallization of a conclusion as to whether the Islamic Republican regime is a greater liability than an asset.

The Malvinas/Falklands crisis focused geopolitical attention on the South Atlantic and the chain of Southern (Austral) Islands which link the southern tip of South America to the Antarctic Peninsula. Factors contributing to the strategic and resource potential of this region are: (1) the speculation that there is oil and gas on or near the continent; (2) the great extent of living maritime resources (fish, krill, seals, whales); (3) the Drake Passage, considered an alternate route to the Panama Canal; and (4) the significance of the Antarctic Peninsula for control of South Atlantic sea lanes. Membership in the Antarctic Treaty System  has continued to grow, giving more countries a stake in events occurring there. This geopolitical attention could acquire either a confrontational or cooperative tone. It seems likely that the South American nations will play a large role in the events taking place around Antarctic, and there exists possibilities for cooperative efforts in handling the resources of the Antarctic.

In considering issues important in school-university collaborative research, the first one examined is the relationship between school context and the collaborative research being conducted. The second issue involves questions of project control and leadership. A description is given of the two models of supervision that are being used. In one model, a cooperating teacher assumes major responsibility for coordinating the teachers and interns within the school.  Another school, using an egalitarian model, has all cooperating teachers meet regularly as a group with the university supervisor in order to address specific questions of intern supervision. Products of the project are briefly described, and intended outcomes are suggested. (JD)",

The study of the training program focused on the interface between the training experiences and the retired teachers' attitudes and behaviors as they became involved in the complexities of mentoring. An essential perspective built into the training design was that retired teachers were viewed as master teachers with valued expertise. Selected retired teachers participated in three separate, intensive, four-day pre-school workshops of 18 hours each. The workshops included large and small group discussions, role  playing, demonstrations, and analysis of videotapes. The results of an analysis of the program's effectiveness are presented in three sections: phases of the transition from master teacher to mentor, comparisons of elementary and secondary teachers during the initial training, and comparisons across training sessions.

The perspective includes the intellectual, ethical, and emotional stance of the teacher who is engaged in, and reflecting upon teaching. The subjective experiences and the personal feelings of teachers are regarded as valuable for an understanding of teaching. Brief case studies are presented of four preschool teachers. To gather ethnographic and autobiographical information on the teachers they were observed in the classroom setting, interviewed to create for each a \"life-narrative\", and they engaged in personal correspondence with the author. In interviews, vignettes, and interpretive  activities,the goal was to build up a store of reflective information about practice and background in order to develop the beginnings of a thoughtful co-biographical narrative. A discussion is presented on the value of using an autobiographical method to achieve a deeper understanding of the teacher's art. (JD)",

The teachers viewed a 15-minute videtape on the subject, responded to a series of scripted questions read by student actors, and later reflected in writing on their teaching performance. The teachers varied by gender, race, years of teaching experience, and level of formal education. Videotapes of each administration were analyzed and the written records were studied in an effort to describe the effects of prior teaching experience and formal education on teacher discourse. An analysis of the discourse strategies of the teachers indicated that related to teaching experience were: (1) length of responses; (2) factual content of responses; (3)  relating history to students' personal experiences; (4) use of humor; (5) meta-talk on the questions; and (6) follow-up to students. The level of formal education was related to strategies 2 and 3 only. (Author/JD)",

The paper highlights the importance of developing \"adequate indicators\" to guage our conceptions of quality and provides selected, standardized instrument data from the study's population as a basis for discussing the importance of commitment to teaching. The paper also explores the value of sustained or extended recruitment as a way to develop and monitor students' introduction to the teaching profession. Finally, the paper frames these data-based discussions within a critique of current reform agendas designed to recruit quality students. Contributions toward substantive reform in teacher preparation will  arise only from teacher education research which sets out to expand intellectual parameters and to bracket public sentiment.

The 16-week program is designed to reduce the separation between clinical field experiences and professional education studies for preservice secondary teachers. The program has three phases: (1) university-based methods course and directed field experience; (2) student teaching; and (3) post-student teaching. The program's focus is on encouraging continuous reflections or theorizing about teaching practice, and throughout the semester teaching is presented as an investigative activity. Journals, observation assignments, and the discussions they generate, serve as a  backdrop for the treatment of specific teaching methods. Student teachers are encouraged to engage in the action research cycle (planning, acting, observing, and reflecting) in order to discover possibilities, to identify patterns and/or relationships in their practice, to judge and appraise practice, and to take actions based upon analysis of their past practice. During the post-student teaching phase of the semester students discuss and present their projects and link their findings to earlier discussions of specific approaches to teaching. (JD)",

Many of the suggestions from the two reports are similar to established practices for restructuring teacher education that were developed and implemented by National Teacher Corps, originating more than 20 years ago. The majority of Teacher Corps Programs were graduate degrees in fields other than education and trained in pedagogy with emphasis on immediate application in classrooms. Differentiated staffing was a consideration in Teacher Corps Programs. This paper points out that re-examining the thrusts of the the Teacher Corps and the Holmes and Carnegie reports leads to the conclusion that some reforms may result in  finding answers from previously tried experimental programs.

A group of 26 secondary teachers were divided into an experimental and a control group and were administered the McConnell revised Teacher Behavior Description Questionnaire (TBDQ) and the California Psychological Inventory Empathy Scale (CPI) prior to and following treatment. The treatment consisted of 40 hours of creativity training conducted at Synectics, Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts. This training emphasized experimentalism, idea development, positive interaction and empathic responses. It was concluded that the experimental group manifested statistically significant increases in empathy in comparison to the control  group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to the four subscales of the TBDQ. However, the control group did manifest statistically significant increases on the TBDQ Teacher Actual Behavior and Student-rated Actual Behavior subscales. Following the training, teachers reported that they were more open with student ideas and responses, reinforced students, allowed experimentation, and listened more intently to student input. (JD)",

Interview and observation data from four teachers provided the information for an analysis of this topic. A pattern is seen of development in teachers' awareness of the events of their practice. Initially, awareness is at the level of becoming familiar with strategies with which one is comfortable and capable. Another level involves \"fine tuning\" one's strategies. At both levels, teachers are seeing their practice within a constant frame, and are unlikely to be attentive to the \"back talk\" from their classrooms. At another level,  teachers are able to listen to students and to their practices, to reflect on puzzling situations, and begin to see their teaching in a new frame. This seeing practice differently is played out in the actions of teaching and is not necessarily thought out. Brief case histories are given of the four teachers studied, each of whom demonstrates teacher thinking at some point in the developmental continuum of learning to teach. (JD)",

In deciding which teachers would comprise the research sample, pupils were invited to describe the strengths of their recent teachers. Pupil perceptions of exemplary teacher characteristics and a consensus of teachers identified as effective resulted in the selection of teachers with different strengths and different subject specialties from secondary school and feeder primaries. These teachers selected the aspects of their teaching which particularly pleased or satisfied them. It was noted that  they initially referred to their pupils' activities or progress in pointing out elements what they consider successful teaching. An analysis of of data gathered from observation and taped reflections highlights variations among the teachers as well as generalizations on the many similarities on how the teachers evaluated their own teaching. A set of inter-connected concepts developed from intensive studies of teachers' interviews and responses to questions led to a theoretical framework of how exemplary teachers form standardized patterns of action or routines in order to maintain particular desired states in pupil activity or to promote specific kinds of progress.

Teachers perceive that PET-training has had a positive effect on their classroom performance, and they employ PET concepts regularly. Except for an increased number of coaching observations for recent trainees, the results were consistent across the three groups of PET-trained teachers. Both trained and untrained teachers were asked how many times a year they would like to have their classroom teaching observed for the purpose of improving teaching skills. Non-PET trained teachers desired significantly more observations than those  who had received PET training. A factor analysis of variables related to implementation of coaching revealed four coaching behavior factors. Coaching behaviors were generally found to be consistent with the PET model on three of these factors, with approximately half the coaches deviating from the PET model on the fourth factor.

Evaluation as empowerment and possible links between empowerment and increased utilization of evaluation results are explored. Evaluation as empowerment assumes that individuals need to be personally productive and responsible in coping with their environment. If evaluation is seen as empowerment, the evaluator is recognized as the enabler. A case study of a participatory evaluation illustrates these concepts. In the case study, six young people conducted a survey of youth employment needs in a small upstate New York community. Evaluation use will only become more evident if participation involves stakeholders in empowering ways. Stakeholders must fully understand the evaluation  process, be willing to support it, and feel enough sense of involvement and accountability to work toward changes. (SLD)",

Random samples of entrants at a predominantly White eastern state university were administered the Noncognitive Questionnaire (NCQ) during summer orientation in 1979 and 1980. The subjects included 208 Black and 1,475 White entering freshmen. The NCQ results and the SAT scores were used to derive structural models (using LISREL) of early academic success for both Black and White students. The structural models for the Black and White students were found to be  very different. For Black students, traditional academic ability was related to first semester GPA, but neither GPA nor academic ability was related to persistence. Only the non-cognitive dimensions were predictive of Black student persistence. For White students, academic ability was the best predictor of first semester grades and these grades were the major predictor of subsequent persistence. The non-cognitive dimensions were not important in White student academic success, while they were crucial in Black student academic success. (Author/SLD)",

The theorem is substantially extended, and shown to have fundamental implications for the theory and practice of statistics. It supports an operational meaning for the partial assertion of prevision via asserted bounds. The theorem is expanded to apply to general quantities; to allow bounds and orderings on previsions as input to the programming problem; and to yield bounds, even on conditional previsions, as output. Consequences include the ultimate strengthening of any probability inequality based on linear constraints, such as the Bienayme-P. L. Chebyshev inequality and an inequality related to Kolmogorov's inequality, but based only on the judgment of a sequence of  quantities as exchangeable. Included in the wide variety of potential applications are the safety assessment of complex engineering systems, the analysis of agricultural production statistics, and a synthesis of subjective judgments in macro-economic forecasting. Prevision is explicitly recognized as a completion of the notion of logical assertion, introduced by Frege. (Author/SLD)",

The BNLP may be one of the most extensively evaluated national literacy programs ever conducted, with a program staff intensively trained in evaluation. One lesson of the repeated evaluations of the BNLP is that a point comes when evaluation may use resources needed for program implementation. Evaluation cannot be fully exorcised of politics; however, the political ramifications must at least be clarified and the worst political encroachments resisted. Internal evaluations seemed to serve program implementation better and demonstrated the usefulness of the Action Training Model. The need to intervene and control partly explained when and why the  various evaluations were commissioned and what use was made of evaluation results. (SLD)",

The learning procedures must be capable of modifying the connection strengths in such a way that internal units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain. Several interesting gradient-descent procedures have recently been discovered. Each connection computes the derivative, with respect to the connection strength, of a global measure of the error in the performance of the network. The strength is then adjusted in the direction that decreases the error. These relatively simple, gradient-descent learning procedures work  well for small tasks and the new challenge is to find ways of improving the speed of learning so that they can be applied to larger, more realistic tasks.

Commentary and research on elements of the evaluation process are examined in this framework, and the ways in which formal programs and policies have impact on evaluation are considered. The framework here presented is summarized as: (1) establishing evaluation purposes; (2) assigning tasks to students; (3) setting student performance criteria; (4) setting performance standards; (5) sampling information on student performance; (6) assessing student performance; (7) providing feedback to students; and (8) monitoring outcomes of evaluation. This framework is a  first step toward the comprehensive framework needed for effective evaluation. A 13-page list of references and four tables are presented. (SLD)",

There was essentially no evidence to support the effectiveness of group-based mastery learning on standardized achievement measures. Effects were generally positive, though moderate, on experimenter-made measures, with little evidence that they were maintained over time.

        "description":"This paper offers evidence, both empirical and qualitative, linking R. J. Sternberg's Triarchic Theory of Intelligence with H. A. Witkin's Theory of Field-dependence/independence (FDI). Some of the logical arguments are articulated that can be made connecting studies on FDI done in the past with aspects of Sternberg's componential and contextual concepts of intelligence. Focus is on the following issues: (1) FDI-related differences in the ability to structure when structure is not provided; (2) FDI-related differences in dependence on salient cues; (3) FDI as it might relate to practical intelligence; (4) FDI as a matter of intelligence and achievement; and (5) the malleability of FDI characteristics and intelligence. FDI data are presented, which are consistent with some of  Sternberg's proposals. The relationship between intelligence and FDI is worth exploring as a way of identifying individuals who might profit from special enrichment programs. (Author/TJH)",

A group of the regular clientele of the school (55 eleventh graders) was compared with a group of low-income minority students given scholarships to the course (33 Black or Hispanic eleventh graders). The effects of the coaching school were studied, using equivalent control and experimental groups. Administrative problems and time constraints resulted in a lower quality instructional environment for the scholarship students. After coaching, regular students increased their SAT scores by about 52 points for verbal and 58 points for math. For scholarship students, coaching had no effect on verbal scores and increased their scores by about 57 points for math. This  may have reflected a lack of experience in teaching minority students by the instructors as well as inadequate high school preparation for the type of instruction offered. (SLD)",

The concept of a testing procedure that selects items to match the level of performance of an examinee during the administration of a test had to wait for the technology necessary to apply the idea.

The results confirm a four-factor structure and reveal all factor loadings and covariances to be invariant across groups; 11 of 21 uniquenesses were non-invariant. Although, in a strict statistical sense, the differentially reliable items bore implications of bias in favor of the high track, these discrepancies, on the basis of absolute values, were judged to be of little practical significance. Overall, in light of the stringency  of LISREL CFA procedures in general, and those used in this study in particular, the SDQ III demonstrated exceptionally superior psychometric properties.

The evaluation involved several researchers working independently and information collected using a variety of both quantitative and qualitative methods (including student and staff interviews and questionnaire surveys, nominal group procedures with staff, and administration of instruments assessing student perceptions of classroom-level and teacher perceptions of school-level environment). The most striking finding emerging from almost every aspect of the evaluation was the success of the Colleges in creating a positive ethos for both students and staff. Some of the areas of concern which were  identified included a relatively low level of student cohesiveness, confusion about the purpose of the Colleges, the distracting behavior of some younger students, and staff's conditions of service.

The results of item bias detection methods based on this conditional definition and using a stepwise or iterative procedure appear to be adequate. In this paper, experimental studies in the Netherlands on the explanation of item bias are reported. For each of the 60 items of an arithmetic test, an assessment was made as to whether the item was biased between Dutch and Turkish/Moroccan students at the end of their sixth-grade year. Hypotheses were formulated to explain the bias. According to the hypotheses, biased items were modified to become less biased and unbiased items were modified to become more biased. The original and  modified test versions were randomly administered to each of 169 students of Dutch origin and 93 students of Turkish or Moroccan origin. The statistical tests showed that the hypothesis was confirmed in only three of the 38 cases. (Author/TJH)",

Almost all of the subjects were 11th graders (97.8%), with 0.7% sophomores and 1.5% seniors. Seven items on the verbal and 10 on the math section showed more than a 10% difference in the percentage of each sex getting them correct. An additional 22 verbal items and 16 math items showed a difference greater than 5% in favoring one sex. Other questions considered were methods of test construction that might reduce bias, the relationships between SAT scores and school performance, the role of  test anxiety on SAT performance, and the effects of SAT scores on college choices. As other researchers have found, girls did less well than boys on the SAT, yet had higher school grades. Recommendations for sex-fairer tests include the following: (1) remove items having large response differences between the sexes unless balanced by other items; (2) manipulate mean scores on the verbal test so that males and females score equally; (3) ensure that verbal content on math items favors girls; and (4) make validity studies correlating test scores and first-year college performance widely available both to consumers and researchers.

The data for the study were generated using the Statistical Analysis System computing package. The results indicate that no single transformation or analysis procedure is uniformly superior in controlling the family-wise error rate or in statistical power. The relationship  between sample size and variances is a major factor in selecting a contrast analysis procedure. Adopting a multiple analysis strategy is recommended.

The difference is so small that it appears that gender differences in verbal ability no longer exist. A major goal was also to define age trends in the pattern of gender differences. Analyses of effect sizes for different measures of verbal ability showed almost all to be small in magnitude; these measures covered vocabulary, analogies, reading comprehension, speech production, essay writing, anagrams, and general verbal ability. For the 1985 administration of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, verbal scores showed superior male performance. Analysis of tests requiring different cognitive processes  involved in verbal ability gave no evidence of substantial gender differences in any aspect of processing. An analysis by age showed no striking changes in the magnitude of gender differences at different ages, countering E. E. Maccoby and C. N. Jacklin's conclusion that gender differences in verbal ability emerge at about 11 years of age. Comparison of studies published in 1973 or earlier with subsequent studies indicates a slight decline in the magnitude of the gender differences in recent years. These findings have implications for theories of sex differences in brain lateralization and changing gender roles.

The first conceptualization was developed in Hungary and involves three domains of school motivation: (1) affective; (2) cognitive; and (3) moral. The first study explored the factor structure in the two countries of an inventory designed to operationalize this first set of concepts. The second conceptualization focused on intrinsic, extrinsic and achievement factors as well as fear of failure. In research at the university level, these forms of motivation have been found to relate to  qualitative differences in approaches to learning and studying. The second study used an extended inventory to investigate the interrelationships between the two conceptualizations of motivation and approaches to learning and studying. Finally, an instrument was developed to assess students' attributions of success and failure and the feelings associated with those attributions. Factor analysis indicated identical factor structures in all of the instruments developed for the two countries. The analyses enabled a more complete mapping of the components of school motivation to be achieved. Eleven tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"A longitudinal study of achievement data from public schools in Durham County, North Carolina, was undertaken to examine individual growth curves as well as to chart the progress of educational institutions and the effects of aggregation on the study of growth. A two-level hierarchical linear model was used in the study to specify individual growth and to relate the parameters of the growth model to a relevant background variable. Computer analysis was conducted using TIMEPATH, a program written in GAUSS, a matrix programming language developed by Aptech Systems, Inc. Data consisted of eight waves of achievement scores collected in the spring of each year from 1978 to 1985, and three ability scores collected in the fall of 1979 for a cohort of students as they progressed from  Grade 1 to 8. Tests included the Prescriptive Reading Inventory, Diagnostic Mathematics Inventory, California Achievement Tests, and tests within the North Carolina Annual Testing Program. Results indicate that the use of growth curves as indices of change has numerous advantages over other methods, and that longitudinal data analyses are feasible for school districts when a suitable longitudinal database has been maintained. Growth curves focus on the use of multi-wave data, provide statistical advantages of multiple occasions of measurement, and emphasize the individual student. Nine tables and two graphs are included.

The approach involves an individual growth model to estimate performance on each measure. Then, information from multiple measures is combined in profiles to investigate multivariate aspects of status and growth, including intra-individual strengths and weaknesses. A simple straight-line growth model is used. During 1985, the approach was applied to a group of students who attended all four years of high school in the San Francisco Unified School District during the 1980-81/1983-84 period. Data  consist of scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, Form S, Level 4, administered in the fall of 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983. Individual and group analyses were conducted.

        "description":"The effects of correlated dimensions on parameter estimation were assessed, using a two-dimensional item response theory model. Past research has shown the inadequacies of the unidimensional analysis of multidimensional item response data. However, few studies have reported multidimensional analysis of multidimensional data, and, in those using simulated data, the results were usually based on replication. Multidimensional analysis of simulated two-dimensional item response data fitting the M2PL model of M. D. Reckase (1985) was done using the analysis program known as MIRTE. A Monte Carlo study was employed. Three data sets (2,000 ability vectors by 104 items) were generated to satisfy different degrees of correlation between the two abilities. The data sets and analyses were  replicated 100 times each. Summary statistics on the 100 replications were used to examine the effects of the degree of correlation between ability dimensions. Results shed light on the degree of correlation between the two ability dimensions. Ability and item parameters were recovered well enough to encourage further investigation of and to justify limited use of multidimensional analysis. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"Two intermediate elementary schools in the Bay Shore District of Bay Shore, New York, were studied to assess the impact upon student achievement of a program in cooperative learning applied to mathematics, reading, and writing. The schools include the Gardiner Manor and South Country Schools; in the 1986-87 school year, 510 students attended the former, and 449 attended the latter. Twenty-four third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade teachers and their classrooms participated in the study. Assessments were also made to determine the effects of such programming on students' attitudes, self-esteem, and gender and race relations. Demographic analyses were conducted. The study adopted a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design. Data collection instruments included the Iowa Tests of Basic  Skills, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, a modified version of &quot;Who Are Your Friends?&quot;, student writing samples, and various attitude inventories. Unlike previous studies, cooperative learning in this instance did not prove to be any more effective than traditional educational strategies in increasing students' achievement, enhancing race and gender relations, or improving youngsters' attitudes toward school. The complexity of the experimental design, its compressed nature, and the effectiveness of the existing traditional curriculum may explain this result. Positive gains found for Hispanic students should be investigated further. A 115-item reference list is presented. (TJH)",

The DMIMS is a criterion-referenced standardized test comprised of seven levels, and it can be used to assess student performance from the middle of kindergarten to the end of ninth grade. Two mathematics educators participated in the study and completed the same task. Findings indicate that the DMIMS reached from 17% to 48% of the NAEP's matrix cells, figures that did not differ dramatically from earlier results on norm-referenced tests and an earlier NAEP system. The NAEP does not address each content-process combination at each  level, and comparing these figures to a 100% base would not be appropriate. These findings show that individuals concerned with student assessment in mathematics along the NAEP system will find that the DMIMS attends to the same interests as do the norm-referenced standardized tests on mathematics. Findings also have implications for inclusion in tests of items other than those that deal with operations with numbers. Thirteen tables are included, and notes and references are appended. (TJH)",

All writing activities took place within the respective classrooms during the morning, and the students were given as much time to complete the writing assignments as they needed. Ninety-two imaginative writing samples were collected; 72 informative writing samples were collected; and 76 persuasive writing samples were collected. Results were compared to NAEP findings for the national sample. For informative and persuasive writing, the NAEP sample produced superior writing samples, but the study sample was superior in imaginative  writing. Within the study sample, no significant differences were attributable to gender for imaginative or informative writing, but females were superior to males in persuasive writing. The distribution of scores in the study sample was different from NAEP findings, indicating that the NAEP results have applications as a criterion in schools and do not exist for their own sake.

In the first year, Project HELP received 8,222 calls, and throughout the year, teachers answered an average of 97 calls per day during the afternoon and evening hours that the service was provided. More than half of the callers asked for help in mathematics. In the 1986-87 school year, Project HELP operated 127 evenings and received 16,528 calls, with an average of 130 calls taken each evening. Results of a survey of 263 contacts indicate that over 90%  of the students considered that their questions had been adequately answered. Many callers were frequent users of the service; it was also found, however, that Hispanic and Asian students were underrepresented in proportion to their numbers. Increased promotion should encourage more students to use Project HELP, a service considered very worthwhile by users and teacher participants. (SLD)",

        "description":"The distinctive focus of interpretive research on the meaning of curriculum is described, and the reconceptualization of the practice that interpretive studies provide is illustrated. The illustration includes the use of an interpretive lens to assess curriculum differentiation in lower-track high school classes. The interpretivist's interest in meaning provokes inquiry in three general domains: (1) the perspectives of school participants; (2) the processes in which meaning is constructed; and (3) the contexts in which meaning is shaped. From the interpretivist's perspective, curriculum differentiation is a sociocultural, political process in which teachers' and students' definitions of their roles and of knowledge interact in particular institutional settings. In the process,  track placement, roles, interactional prerogatives, status, and knowledge are differentially allocated within a school and between schools. Application of the interpretive approach to a 2,000-student midwestern United States comprehensive high school provides insights into students' and teachers' perspective of the lower-track curriculum and patterns of resolving classroom conflicts. Results suggest that differentiation in public high schools occurs, in degree and process, much like differentiation in American society as a whole. The study also demonstrates that as important as the question of whether students and teachers come to school with different views of important knowledge is the question of why and how the differences are made important within the school. Thirteen notes and 87  references are appended. (TJH)",

Pupil control ideology and teacher behavior are conceptualized along a continuum that goes from humanistic to custodial. Instruments were administered to 239 elementary and secondary teachers in five school districts (urban, suburban, and rural) in a midwestern state to ascertain their control ideologies. It was found that control ideology and behavior of teachers did have an impact on the quality of school life for students. Custodial classrooms with faculty-student relationships characterized by  dominance and subordination, mistrust, conformity, and punitive sanctions had deleterious effects on students' satisfaction with school, their commitment to classwork, and their reactions to teachers. Humanistic classrooms with faculty ideology and behavior marked by acceptance, understanding, trust, flexibility, and attempts to encourage self-discipline resulted in positive attitudes toward school, high commitment to classwork, and positive reactions to teachers. The influence of faculty on students was found to be powerful and pervasive. More humanistic control is needed in the organizational culture of public schools.

        "description":"For students in most high schools, graduation is predicated on the successful completion of a specified number of courses or credits. In most cases when these students fail they are not retained in grade but become credit deficient. This report is concerned with a longitudinal study of loss of credit among high school students in the St. Paul (Minnesota) Public School District. For each course failed data were recorded on the following items: (1) student's demographic profile; (2) student's attendance record; (3) course information; and (4) teacher recorded information. An analysis of four years of data sought to find patterns and changes in the way failures had occurred. The findings showed that absenteeism was the best predictor of future credit loss and that dangerous patterns  of absenteeism may begin as early as elementary school. The conclusions include the following: (1) absenteeism must be addressed in schools before it leads to credit loss; (2) teachers must expect and reward good attendance; (3) administrative actions must include both incentives for attendance and penalties for non-attendance; (4) the causes of absenteeism must be probed; and (5) minority students are more susceptible to the loss of credit than are white students. More studies of loss of credit are needed in other settings to address these concerns more thoroughly. Statistical data are included in 12 tables and 6 graphs. (VM)",

Many of the southern racial tragedies of the past are still unresolved and this is reflected in schools as they teach about the South. Since schools are dependent on published materials to teach classes, and since there is wide variation in how these materials treat topics such as slavery, no common picture of southern culture is being given. For significant social change to occur, black and white students need a new curriculum free of distortions. The new South is fundamentally different from the old South in that there is a redistribution of economic and political resources. In some instances scholars of the American South are redefining  southern culture to incorporate the experiences of blacks and other ethnic groups. This must be reflected in texts and other educational materials. More research is needed to investigate how culture can mitigate learning or serve as a vehicle for liberation. (VM)",

The study focused on how at-risk students performed on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Scores were compared among ethnic groups and with those of Caucasian students in the same school. Significant differences were found between ethnic groups and between socioeconomic classes. Sex was a factor in grade point average where females were  significantly higher than males. Korean students outperformed others on the SAT. Even students who performed at low levels within their courses went on to college after graduation. This was thought to be due to the exposure they received to an academic curriculum and those content areas required for college. Also their confidence was boosted from the knowledge that they had completed a rigorous program.

The findings included the following: (1) most of these students had not needed special education services, those who did needed low levels of service; (2) the  performance of the Chapter 1 students on statewide reading and mathematics tests was similar to that of ninth graders throughout the state but lower than that of ninth graders in the district; (3) the target group performed below grade level on criterion-referenced tests; (4) the suspension rate for the Chapter 1 students was over twice that of other students in their cohort; and (5) the Chapter 1 students experienced other problems, in areas such as achievement, speech and language, listening and social or emotional adjustment. Statistical data are provided on tables. (VM)",

        "description":"The three conference papers presented in this document are grouped under the general heading, &quot;Our National Dilemma,&quot; and deal with issues involved in providing disadvantaged students with a quality education. The first paper, &quot;Building Quality Relationships&quot; (James Comer), discusses the need to improve the quality of relationships between home and school, and between adults and children. Preschool experiences are important sources of these relationships. The black experience in America created conditions that disconnected black families from the mainstream of society, and denied many black children the kinds of preschool experiences that would allow them to succeed in school. The second paper, entitled &quot;The Educationally Disadvantaged Are Still among Us&quot; (Henry Levin), discusses  the new reforms and the disadvantaged and the social consequences of inaction. A discussion on what needs to be done is provided, and a new approach--the establishment of Accelerated Schools for the Disadvantaged--is suggested. The third paper, &quot;Understanding the Dimensions of Our Problem&quot; (Samuel Betances), presents a personal account of the experiences of a black Puerto Rican in America. Educators who teach minorities from dominant/host society enclaves should focus on empowering them with job skills, and the skills to reject rejection. Businesses should sponsor evening tutoring centers for children whose parents are unable to help them at home. (BJV)",

The first paper, entitled &quot;The Organization--A Viable Instrument for Progress&quot; (Barbara Sizemore), addresses the subject of high-achieving, predominantly black elementary schools. Routines in these schools not present in low-achieving black schools are identified. Principals in high-achieving schools changed the structure of the school and the attitudes of the teachers to adapt to the needs of black students. The second paper, &quot;Equity, Relevance, and Will&quot; (Kati Haycock), asserts that equal opportunity does not exist: schools that serve minority children have fewer resources than other schools, and tracking often sorts minorities into lower ability groups.  Minorities, therefore, are often not as well prepared for college as are their majority counterparts. Components of high-achieving schools are identified. Principals should be allowed to bring about change, and schools should build leadership teams to help minorities succeed. The third paper, &quot;Effective Instructional Approaches to Bilingual Education&quot; (Fred Tempes), describes the California State Department of Education's attempt to implement a consistent pedagogy across bilingual programs in California. The positive and negative effects of bilingualism are examined. Non-English speaking students in five schools learned all their subject area material in Spanish, and were gradually taught in English. The program appeared to be successful. (BJV)",

Dropping out is the anti-climactic conclusion of a long, visible, and painful process, and the dropout problem will continue to worsen. Approaches to reducing the number of dropouts are susgested. The second paper, &quot;Reducing Dropouts through Community Promoted Initiatives&quot; (Roger D. Mitchell), consolidates suggestions for reducing dropouts through community and business promoted initiatives developed by community task forces on education in  Rochester, New York, and Flint, Michigan. The third paper, &quot;Innovative Community Sponsored Projects&quot; (Lori S. Orum), discusses community-based approaches to improve the educational status of Hispanics developed by the National Council of La Raza, such as the Academia del Pueblo, Project Success, Project Second Chance, Parents as Partners, and the Teacher Support Network.

The first paper, &quot;Integrated Content Language Approach&quot; (Jose Galvan), suggests that LEP students who are at the intermediate level or beyond will benefit from programs integrating content and language instruction because their transitional progress will have the added advantage of a strong affective element. Interest in the language being used will rise, and their progress in the subject matter will continue. The second paper, entitled &quot;The Eastman Success Story for Helping Limited English Proficient Students Succeed&quot; (Bonnie Rubio), describes the Eastman Curriculum Design Project implemented in seven schools in the Los  Angeles Unified School District in California. The program focuses on language separation: subject matter is taught either in Spanish, sheltered English, or mainstream English. The goals of the program are high-level oral fluency in English and academic achievement. The third paper, &quot;Helping Limited English Proficient Students Succeed&quot; (Amado Padilla), asserts that the stress that LEP children experience is very different from the stress that children generally have. External and internal mediators, which buffer the impact of stress, can be developed; if LEP students learn how to cope with stress, they will be less at risk of dropping out. (BJV)",

The program focuses on helping teachers address the issues of content and concept through collaborative organization. A new model, expanding the role of the teacher as instructional leader, professional developer, mentor, and clinical consultant, should be considered. The second paper, &quot;Teacher Effectiveness&quot; (Charles Moody), asserts that teachers and schools have been effective in their original purpose: to legitimize adult economic inequality. To make schools truly  effective we must realize that all students can learn, and that we know all we need to know to educate all students. When educators understand that equity and excellence do not compete with each other, then schools will become effective. Recommendations are made for improving teacher effectiveness. The third paper, &quot;Improving the Quality of Teachers for Minority Students&quot; (Ana Marie Schuhmann), reviews the declining numbers of minority teachers, and suggests various ways of improving teacher quality to help close the achievement gap between majority and minority students.

        "description":"Problems of urban high schools, including poor attendance, high dropout rates, low achievement, and poor social relationships, are linked together by a strong sense of alienation among students and teachers. Yet much of the educational research and policy treat these issues separately. In this study a conceptual framework for understanding student and teacher commitment is presented and illustrated with data from a field study of 10 urban high schools. An open-ended interview approach was used to obtain information on school factors, student commitment, and teacher commitment. The findings showed how teachers and students are in conflict even though they are members of two mutually dependent subcultures. Teachers and students must respect and affiliate with one another. Teachers  must make schoolwork interesting for students. Administrative tasks and paperwork must be decreased to a level that does not burden teachers. Administrative support for teachers is needed. Strategies for maximizing commitment must include attention to the following five school factors: (1) relevance; (2) respect; (3) support; (4) expectations; and (5) influence. (VM)",

During the first two years of the program, 18 mini-grants were awarded to 16 teachers, one student, and one parent organization. A large number of both regular and special education students, from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade, received benefits from the projects. The projects were cost-efficient and encouraged active student participation in the educational process. Many of the programs were characterized by the following: (1) a hands-on approach to learning; (2) the use of outside human resources; (3) culminating activities that served as an evaluative measure; (4) an investigative approach to learning; and (5) a focus on  the specific needs of the pupils. BEEF uses a simplified proposal process. Some projects in the following areas are described: (1) the humanities and social sciences; (2) mathematics and science; and (3) special education.

The data are limited to the enrollment of civilian noninstitutional population in regular schools, and thus exclude enrollments in vocational schools, adult education classes, and special schools. The report also includes summary data from earlier CPS surveys, and a discussion of recent enrollment trends. The following highlights are included: (1) elementary and high school enrollment was 40.8 million in 1985, down from 46.1 million in 1975; (2)  enrollment rates of 6- to 15-year-olds remained essentially the same, while the enrollment rates of 16- and 17-year olds grew slightly; (3) there were 12.5 million college students in 1985, 15 percent above enrollment in 1975; (4) the college enrollment rate of black 18- to 21-year-olds remained at 25 percent from 1975 to 1985, and the proportion of the age group who were high school dropouts declined by 10 percentage points to 17 percent; (5) preprimary enrollment of 3- to 5-year-olds was 5.9 million in 1985, an 18 percent increase from 1975 (due partially to a rise in the number of 3- to 5-year-olds); (6) in 1985, 38 percent of kindergarten students attended all day, up from 14 percent in 1970; and (7) in 1985, 34 percent of nursery school students attended all day, compared with 27  percent in 1970.

Census counts for 1980 are also shown for each of the areas. Except for Puerto Rico, all of the areas are growing at a rate well above that of the United States (6.4 percent). Of all the areas, Guam has exhibited the most growth since 1980--19.6 percent. Although both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have increased in population since 1980, both experienced population declines between 1985 and 1986: the Virgin Islands declined by 1.2 percent, Puerto Rico by 0.3 percent. The components of population decline are natural change (births minus deaths) and net migration (immigrants minus emigrants). Limitations of the  estimates are discussed.

The Act established a legalization program that permits undocumented aliens to become permanent residents. Aliens have until May 4, 1988 to apply for residence; Congress is considering extending the deadline. However, extending the deadline may not encourage these aliens to apply for residency because of the following reasons: (1) no reliable data exist to forecast the number of aliens who will apply; (2) The 1.3 to 1.5 million expected applicants are fewer than the initial forecast of 2 to 3.9 million made by the Immigration and  Naturalization Service (INS); (3) awareness of the legalization program is high among Hispanics, according to a study that addressed program awareness; (4) extending the deadline may require appropriating additional funds; (5) the operational problems that exist do not threaten the program's viability; (6) the program has similarities to other countries' legalization programs; and (7) studies by others provide reasons why some aliens have not applied.

        "description":"Scientific investigations of the relationship between race and rape have been flawed by the acceptance of official statistics and have been influenced by prevailing myths about rape and race. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding rape and race. The thesis is presented that only the black victim of sexual assault is viewed by society as a legitimate victim. The society is able to neutralize such assaults against black victims by denying the responsibility of the perpetrator, denying that the black woman was injured by the assault, and denying that such assaults constitute victimization of black women. Historically, this has been supported by the legal system which treats white and black rape victims differently. Public reports, serious treatment in court,  criminal charges, and court sentences are less common when black women are raped. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of slavery on the victimization of black females and the influence of the patriarchal system in legitimizing the victimization of all women. New models must be developed for understanding all categories of race and rape. Statistical information and references are provided. (Author/VM)",

Experimental valuation methods can reclassify or misclassify individuals considered to be in or out of poverty. The Census Bureau's publications do not give adequate warning of the magnitude of differences in poverty estimates resulting from conceptual, operational, and computational concerns with the valuation of noncash benefits. More work needs to be done to  improve how we measure poverty in the United States. Data are presented on a table.

In fiscal year 1986, 83.4 percent of all AFDC households in the United States participated in the Food Stamp Program. Participation rates for individual states varied from 93.3 percent (Michigan) to 58.9 percent (Virginia). Participation rates for households comprised solely of AFDC recipients were higher than rates for all AFDC households; rates for households containing AFDC recipients as well as people not receiving AFDC benefits were lower than those for all AFDC  households. Because the way that the state programs count household income is not uniform, many AFDC households that did not participate in the Food Stamp Program may not have been eligible to do so.

The primary objectives of the project were to demonstrate that there are children's books that beginning readers can read to their children, to offer suggestions about reading to children, and to provide opportunities to share experiences and concerns, and to practice reading some children's picture books in a supportive and nonthreatening atmosphere. Local education and community service agencies interested in participating in the family reading project were identified. Then, in collaboration with the Free Library of Philadelphia and nine of the local education and community service programs, eight two-part family reading workshops were  held for nonreading parents. The first session of each workshop was hosted by a community program, and the second half was held at a nearby branch of the library. Overall, the project was quite successful and well received, the main problem being poor workshop attendance at some sites. It was felt that attendance could be improved by allowing for seasonal conditions and child care needs when scheduling future workshops. (Appendixes include the initial project letter and questionnaire, workshop schedules, and workshop materials. Resource lists include books: (1) for parents; (2) for preschool children; (3) about black children; and (4) to use with Spanish-American children. (MN)",

Strategies, academic skills, reading, writing, and mathematics were introduced as part of the program. Over the years, counselors at the Center have noted the substance abusers have one outstanding problem--poor self-image. Clients were helped to set goals and to prepare for the General Educational Development Tests in order to receive a high school diploma. A curriculum centered on motivation lessons that would increase self-esteem, enhance decision-making ability, and give the students goal-making skills was developed and implemented. The BASIS  test was used for pre- and posttesting. Self-esteem was measured by the Junior-Senior High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ). To implement the curriculum, two adult learning center instructors met with 41 Crossroads students in groups of eight for two hours per week. Lessons included exercises, grammar, sharing of feelings, writing activities, and group discussion. The results of the academic testing showed increases in both mathematics and reading areas. The results of the personality testing were inconclusive, often due to the clients' use of medication, but their comments and the comments of staff members were positive. Many of the students were continuing their education following the conclusion of the program. (Ten motivation lessons that were developed for the program are  included in this report.) (KC)",

The case studies are grouped into three categories. The first six case studies are examples of programs that have been developed to assist in training for new jobs as a result of business relocation or expansion. They illustrate ways in which state assistance (either alone or coupled with local money) and community and/or regional economic development organizations can create new jobs by attracting business to an area. Next, five case studies show how employer-initiated efforts, in cooperation with local education and training institutions, can help prevent job loss by retraining existing workers  so that they can meet changing workplace needs (such as the adoption of new equipment or processes). The five case studies presented in the third chapter, all of which are dislocated worker programs operated under the auspices of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), reflect strategies for retraining workers who have been laid off from their jobs with little or no prospect of ever returning to them. These programs exemplify how employers, unions, local governments, and JTPA Private Industry Councils can join forces to develop dislocated worker programs.

The guide investigates the effects of local politics and organizational turf on a partnership, communication between individuals from different professional worlds, and how turnover of staff can affect a partnership. An indepth look is taken at the realities of mobilizing community leaders and of sustaining those leaders' active involvement over time. The following key issues in nurturing a partnership project are explored: brokering,  forming two groups of the right players, building commitment through ownership, planning a partnership, and preserving the partnership.

Persons testifying included representatives of the Reagan Administration, voluntary nonprofit organizations, various individuals who have been offering such projects over the past several years, and sponsors of the act. Some of the questions addressed in the hearing included the following: (1) will this policy increase the amount of service available to older individuals? (2) will this policy create an entitlement that cannot be guaranteed by the federal government? and (3) will persons who have not previously volunteered be denied  services when participants begin to cash in their credits? Those who testified or gave written statements both supported and rejected the idea of credits for volunteer service, although the majority of those testifying were in favor of some sort of credit system. They testified that such a system would make more volunteer help available and make it easier for senior citizens to accept help. Others were concerned that even more bureaucracy would be created, and they anticipated bookkeeping problems. Further testimony on the proposal was expected following the hearing. (KC)",

The survey showed that over the last decade, the number of mothers in the labor force has grown by nearly 40 percent; for these women, obtaining reliable, high quality care for their children at reasonable cost is often a major problem. Approximately 11 percent of establishments with 10 or more employees offered some benefits to help them with their child-care arrangements. In addition, about 61 percent of establishments had the kinds of policies on flexible work schedules or leave that could help employees handle  child-care arrangements even though these policies may not have been designed with that purpose in mind. About 2 percent of establishments provided day-care facilities, one-third of which were day-care facilities. Large firms and government agencies were more likely to provide these types of benefits than small businesses. Some establishments made other types of arrangements such as flexible time, flexible leave, part-time work, and job sharing. (KC)",

Participation in all Title II-A and II-B programs showed increases; data for Title III and for  SDAs only began to be collected last year and trends cannot be analyzed. Review of the data showed a tremendous variation in participation rates from state to state, involvement of groups representing people with disabilities in the policy or management of JTPA influencing participation, and a smaller number of disabled participants in JTPA programs in states with unemployment rates higher than the national average. Recommendations are provided for increasing participation of disabled persons in JTPA programs. (KC)",

Information on a nationally representative sample of jail inmates was obtained from the 1983 Survey of Inmates of Local Jails sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Some of the major findings of the study were as follows: (1) between 1970 and 1986, arrests for DUI increased nearly 223 percent, while the number of licensed drivers increased by 42 percent; (2) arrest rates for DUI were highest  among 21-year-olds; (3) since 1983, most states have raised the minimum age for consumption of alcoholic beverages to 21; (4) per capita arrest rates for DUI for those aged 18-20 have decreased by 14 percent since 1983; (5) prior to their arrest for DWI, convicted offenders had consumed a median of 6 ounces of pure alcohol; (6) for DWI offenders sentenced to jail, the median term imposed was five months; and (7) those in jail for DWI were 95 percent male, had a median age of 32, and reflected a racial distribution similar to the adult general population.

It discusses extension functions in agricultural production institutions and varying institutional settings, describes types of extension systems, and considers farmers' degree of influence on extension systems and multiple extension systems. Part II analyzes national arrangements for extension. A chart presents an overview of national arrangements and compares these with extension system approaches and their relationship to farmers. Public sector and private sector extension are then discussed separately. Part III is a critical review of recent developments relating to extension, including focus on private sector provision,  privatization of public extension systems, trend among large farmers to bypass public extension services, research institutions' efforts to provide \"frontline extension,\" development of new designs and mechanisms for linking research and extension, search for participatory methods, and experimentation with hybrid research-extension systems. Part IV recommends four directions or priorities for the future: development policy goals, national arrangements for institutional change, extension agency development, and social science research requirements.

Employee involvement programs in the private sector and in the federal government were studied. The use of seven involvement practices was examined: suggestion systems, survey feedback, quality circles, quality of work-life committees, job redesign, self-managing teams, and employee participation groups. Elements were identified that can help ensure the long-term oranizational support needed for the success of employee involvement programs. Management interest and support was found to be essential for successful implementation. A long-term strategy was shown to be needed to ensure a good match between employee involvement practices  chosen and the organization's culture. The research supported the suggestions of experts that a strategy should include readiness assessment, communication, training, and evaluation. (YLB)",

Nathan Associates, Inc., report, &quot;The Private and Public Costs of Proposed Mandatory Advance Notification Legislation.&quot; It concluded that the methodology and analysis used to construct cost and employment estimates were inadequate to support the study's conclusions. The Nathan study estimated that 460,000 fewer jobs would have been created in the United States if an advance notice requirement had been in effect. The methodology used to estimate the job impact ignored factors far more important than the presence or absence of an advance notice requirement. Aspects of the methodology that raised questions regarding its validity included the selection of countries used in the comparison and the time period  covered by the analysis. The Nathan study estimated that employers would incur yearly costs of $1.8 billion as the result of the enactment of advance notice legislation from three sources: added administrative cost, cost associated with employees quitting after receiving notice but before closing--so-called talent drain, and legal penalties associated with noncompliance. To the extent that firms already have the capacity to plan for the future, the administrative cost estimate was found to be very likely overstated. The talent drain estimate probably overstated the cost by ignoring offsetting gains and overstating the extent to which workers quit their jobs before closing. The penalty cost estimates excluded firms that would be allowed waivers and apparently double counted.  (YLB)",

Nearly 5,000 employers were surveyed in 1987 to determine (1) the incidence of 401(k) plans and their relationship to other types of retirement plans; (2) the variation in plan provisions and experiences across firms; (3) the extent to which plans benefit employees at various salary levels; and (4) anticipated effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on 401(k) plans. The study found that only about 4 percent of all corporations in the sample (about 35,000 firms out of 793,000) sponsor 401(k) plans, that most provided other retirement plans as well, and that most made matching contributions to their plans, except in smaller firms. Nearly  all firms with 5,000 or more employees sponsored 401(k) plans in 1986; about 6 percent of all full-time civilian workers were eligible to participate; and about 62 percent of those workers made contributions. The study also found that (1) 401(k) plans are used almost exclusively for retirement savings, despite hardship withdrawal provisions; (2) about 95 percent of the assets in these plans were invested conservatively; and (3) the plans benefit higher-paid workers more than lower-paid ones. Finally, the study predicted that some of the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 could reduce employee participation in 401(k) plans, especially among higher-paid workers. (KC)",

Eighteen of the respondents were given follow-up interviews. The teachers whose previous studies had been in technical and vocational areas did not find their prior experience nearly as helpful as the teachers with university and college degrees. Student-related problems were generally  perceived as being more serious than teaching practice and self-related problems. The wide range of teaching problems mentioned during the interviews suggests that a problem-based approach would be useful in training teachers in classroom management techniques. It was found that, as students, the teachers need to acquire some diagnostic and management skills for their own academic work and some strategies for remedial work with students.

        "description":"The New South Wales Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system developed its New Opportunities for Women (NOW) course to provide mature women with greater access to technical occupations by making them aware of educational and employment opportunities related to technical fields. The primary objectives of the course are to help women accomplish the following: develop an understanding of their social, political, and economic position in society; develop skills in communications, mathematics, and scientific and technical processes that are not traditionally part of women's experiences; recognize and apply their own skills and develop self-confidence and an increased capacity to control their own lives; and make progress toward further education, training, and employment within a  supportive learning environment. The course has three strands. The work strand explores women's changing role in society, the importance of paid and unpaid work, the labor market, and work force issues. In the technical strand, women are introduced to the technical skills currently used in vocational training and employment (including mathematics, computing, science, and trade and technical skills). The communications strand covers language skills and confidence building. The central issues that arose when the course was taught at Gilmour College include the following: (1) considerable changes in the TAFE system are needed to enable the equitable participation of mature age women; (2) the simultaneous heterogeneity and homogeneity of this group must be taken into account; (3) assessment  procedures should be self rather than group referenced; (4) curriculum relevance must consider the employment discrimination faced by women; and (5) methods used to facilitate learning could be used in TAFE generally.

More specific information was sought in three case studies, the project findings were developed, and recommendations were formulated. Principal conclusions included the following: (1) the task force approach to the management of NCC development is appropriate and effective; (2) the research, development, and diffusion model of curriculum design commonly used in NCC development does not enhance the degree of fidelity in their implementation; (3) the most positive effect of NCC on standards should be the  improvement in the quality of learning materials, but this benefit is not necessarily delivered to students; and (4) national industry/occupational surveys would help maintain standards of NCC. Principal benefits to students were improved mobility and a greater acceptance of state/territory vocational courses by licensing and registration authorities across Australia. Recommendations called for the use of more techniques of curriculum development, feasibility studies prior to authorization of national curriculum projects, and monitoring of NCC implementation.

For this reason, the issue of assessing adult learners' life experiences for the purpose of granting them exemptions from various course work was studied and a model for conducting such assessments was developed. The assessment process uses an assessment panel consisting of people with recognized expertise in the field in question. Persons seeking certification submit portfolios and participate in assessment interviews. After having received the appropriate assessment training, the same panel assesses both portfolio and  interview performance. The portfolio assessment involves checking the relevance of the competencies claimed against the outcomes of the courses from which exemption is being sought and classifying the work presented against rating scales. A structured interview and checklist are used in assessing candidates' interview performance. Provisional exemption is granted by the assessment panel, and assessment of performance continues on the job for a specified period (this is done primarily through a log book). After all of stages stages have been successfully completed, exemption is finally ratified. (MN)",

        "description":"Australia's tertiary institutions and licensing authorities that control the right to work in various trades and professions have largely ignored the need for procedures and processes to recognize formally the knowledge that people gain in their life experiences. For this reason, the issue of assessing adult learners' life experiences for the purpose of granting them exemptions from various course work was studied and a model for conducting such assessments was developed. Persons seeking certification submit portfolios and participate in assessment interviews. A panel of experts in the field in which exemption is being sought assesses candidates' portfolios and conducts a structured interview to assess their performance. The portfolio assessment involves checking the relevance of  the competencies claimed against the outcomes of the courses from which exemption is being sought and classifying the work presented against rating scales. Candidates having satisfactory interviews and portfolios are first granted provisional exemption. Final ratification of the exemption is after a provisional period during which candidates undergo on-the-job assessment. (This report includes extracts from the portfolio of a woman seeking exemption from course work in child care, syllabus information about the courses from which she is seeking exemption, and a bibliography.)

The center issued its first corporate plan in 1985. This second corporate plan is intended to outline the center's main goals for the next 2 to 3 years. During that time the center will seek to maintain its reputation for research and development by working closely with its network, but especially with the Conference of TAFE Directors. The center will continue its concern for economical operation and cost-effectiveness and will maintain its present management structures and  decision-making processes. Its four main approaches to research and its commitment to staff development will be maintained. Nonprint approaches to dissemination will be investigated and tested, and the center's international reputation as an applied research organization will be strengthened.

        "description":"The purpose of this report, based on interviews and examination of relevant reports and papers, is to provide an illuminative picture of technical and further education (TAFE)/industry interaction in Australia. Chapter 1 sets forth a typology of interaction. Chapter 2 examines perspectives on the nature of TAFE/industry collaboration. Three very different views of the relationship are summarized--views that were evident in interviews with TAFE administrators, TAFE college staff, and people from industry. Chapter 3 examines seven basic issues and their implications for interaction between TAFE and industry: ignorance of what TAFE does, credibility of TAFE awards, staff attitudes, what constitutes an industry, identification of industry needs, competition, and state versus local  needs. Chapter 4 studies actual instances of liaison between TAFE and industry in the context of the typology set out in Chapter 1. Chapter 5 looks at two possible directions for future development--the development of industry skills centers and a training levy on industries. The report concludes with a brief chapter reviewing some key ways in which increased industry participation in training might be effected. An appendix contains a report of a preliminary study for the project on the ways and means of promoting shared facilities between TAFE and industry in Western Australia. (YLB)",

A literature search, interviews, and submissions were the principal sources of data for the needs assessment. The following were identified as areas in which senior college staff may require further education: planning for the future of the college, staff management, college administration, educational leadership, communications, and additional professional capacities (report writing, time management, industrial relations and laws, the TAFE authority, disturbed students, implementation of government policies, stress management, problem solving, and  computer literacy). It was recommended that every TAFE teacher, including senior college staff members, be involved in a continuing and individual staff development program, that provision be made for regular confidential performance appraisals for all college staff members throughout their careers, that individualized staff development programs be provided, and that special consideration in staff development programs be given to underrepresented groups.

        "description":"This report describes the U.S. soybean industry from producers to consumers and provides a single source of economic and statistical information on soybeans. Highlights are as follows: U.S. soybean production has increased sevenfold since 1950, making soybeans the second highest valued crop after corn. Soybean production has risen in response to increasing world demand for soybeans and their derivative products, oil and meal. The U.S. share of the world export market has ranged from 65 to 80 percent during the 1980s. Soybean oil accounts for 75 percent of the fats and oils used in edible oil products. Soybean meal is the major high-protein feed for livestock in the United States. U.S. farmers have increased their soybean plantings from 15.6 million acres in 1950 to 60.4 million  acres in 1986. Production increased from 299.2 million to nearly 2 billion bushels, with the average yield per acre increasing from 21.6 to 33.3 bushels. About 55 percent of the U.S soybean crop is crushed domestically, with most of the rest exported as beans. Soybean prices increased moderately through the 1960s and then jumped sharply in the 1970s, reflecting crop failures abroad and increasing world demand for protein feeds. Since the 1970s, soybean prices have fluctuated widely. Government price supports have been available for soybeans every year since 1941 except for 1975, with the season average price exceeding the price support level for most years. The United States remains the world's leading producer and exporter of soybeans; however, its share of world production has dropped  from 74 percent in 1967-69 to 56 percent during 1984-86. (MN)",

A series of eight training modules was developed during the first project year (June 1986 to May 1987). The modules dealt with the rationale for curriculum-based vocational assessment, technical concepts in assessment, steps in conducting a curriculum-based vocational assessment, and procedures for evaluating the curriculum-based vocational assessment process. Field testing of the training modules in a variety of preservice and inservice settings began in the last quarter of the first project year; it is slated for completion at  the end of the second year (May 1988). The inservice field tests involved 38 vocational education and special services personnel at sites in three states. Preservice field testing involved six universities throughout the country. The following activities are scheduled for the third project year (June 1988 through May 1989): revision of the entire training curriculum based on evaluative data obtained from peserrvice and inservice testing; dissemination of the revised products at six workshops; and marketing of the materials by at least one and possibly two professional organizations. Appended are the module evaluation instrument, a product assessment checklist, and a trainer's log. (MN)",

Using as a guide the Washington Commission on Vocational Education's 1986 booklet entitled \"Options for Equivalent Credit in the High School Curriculum,\" project staff completed a review of all vocational classes currently offered at the high school to determine if they could meet the requirements proposed in the booklet. A list of classes that appeared to meet the equivalent credit requirements was compiled and sent to the school's existing curriculum committee. The committee then set up meetings with the recommending departments  and the departments requested to grant equivalent credit. Each proposal was discussed in detail at the meetings. The final steps of the approval process were forwarding those proposals that had been recommended for approval to the high school principal and documenting the approvals and disapprovals with the rationale behind them. (Appendixes include an outline of the equivalent credit procedures developed, cross-credit proposals for vocational classes, a completed request for equivalent credit course approval, and individual academic responses to equivalent credit proposals.)

This study compared the alcohol-related beliefs of subjects who possessed close relatives with alcohol problems with alcohol-related beliefs of subjects who possessed no such relatives. Subjects included college students (N=32) who reported having a mother or father who had experienced problems with alcohol or alcoholism and students (N=32) who reported no such parent. Subjects completed questionnaires on demographics, frequency of alcohol consumption, the presence or absence of a problem drinking relative, and alcohol-related beliefs. Results indicated that alcohol-related beliefs  could be used to differentiate students who came from families with alcoholic relatives from those students who came from problem-free families. No significant differences were found in drinking frequencies of the two groups. Further research is currently underway to delineate the interaction of family dynamics and beliefs about alcohol's effects, alcoholism, and perceptions of vulnerability to alcoholism. (ABL)",

        "description":"Economic well-being after retirement depends on an individual's portfolio which includes income from Social Security, pensions, transfers from public or private sources, and accumulated wealth. Any event which interrupts the savings process can have an adverse effect on an individual's economic status after retirement. Dissolution of marriage, which may affect as many as one-third of all families, is such an event. Marriage dissolution may effect the family's savings rate. Property division rules discourage marital savings if either party anticipates divorce. Because most divorces occur early in the individual's lifetime, the impact on retirement savings can be great. The effect of excluding certain assets from the marital property pool creates differences in the expected rate of  return between property subject, and not subject, to division. The rate of return to marital property is uncertain, not only because the asset has risk, but also because there is a chance that the other spouse will own the asset after marriage. Actual divorce involves economic costs which further reduce the couple's wealth through legal fees, loss of the value of the imperfect annuity that marriage represents, and loss of access to valuable property rights. Whether divorce interrupts the savings process or destroys assets, it is unlikely that most individuals will be able to save enough in later life to overcome the loss. The long-term effect may well be that in future years, a new category of elderly poor will be recognized, those who have experienced divorce. (Author/ABL)",

Data for this study were taken from in-person interviews with a subsample from a longitudinal survey of three-generalizational families. Respondents (N=63) included 18 relatives of elders with a physical illness or chronic disability, 19 relatives of elders suffering from a mental dysfunction, and 25 relatives who reported no illnesses and no caregiving. Interviewees were asked to describe their family situation and were evaluated for depression, degree of burden, and activities of daily living scale to  indicate degree of impairment of relative. There were no significant differences between physically and mentally impaired groups on degree of impairment, burden, or depression. The activities of daily living items predicted burden in the physical impairment group. Moreover, in the physical group, families who provided greater frequency of care reported more burden, while in the mental group, families who provided less care reported more burden. (Author/ABL)",

After this discussion six simulation exercises are provided. In these exercises a situation is described involving the use of test scores by a counselor and then questions are asked about possible test bias, fairness, score differences, and counselor action. Eleven standards for educational and psychological testing and bias in measurement taken from the Standards for Test Use in Counseling are given. Five guidelines for responsible test use in counseling discussed include: (1) using the test for the purpose it was intended; (2) avoiding using a single test score to  make a decision about an individual; (3) using caution when tests have different norms for different groups of individuals; (4) using caution when a procedure assigns individuals to groups on the basis of test score; and (5) being prepared to investigate test score differences across groups of students. Counselors are advised to use common sense above all. (ABL)",

The myriad of social and cultural changes of the past two decades have had a profound effect on the type, intensity, and prevalence of problems currently experienced by women between 30-50 years of age. In the 1980s, normal developmental issues and dynamics are confounded by major changes in family structure and economics, new social and professional roles and expectations, and the pressure associated with redefining lifelong values and perceptions. Until recently, little attention was devoted to the exploration of issues, attitudes, and development of this group. Traditional counseling approaches and development theory have failed  to adequately confront the reality and impact of this disparate experience of males and females within American society. Effective counseling interactions and developmental support programs for women must be based upon a thorough understanding of their uniqueness. (ABL)",

The second part discusses assessing exposures to environmental tobacco smoke, focusing on the external environment, questionnaires, exposure-dose relationship, and biological markers. The third part discusses possible health effects associated with exposure to ETS. These effects include the following: (1) sensory reactions; (2) lung function and respiratory symptoms; (3) lung cancer; (4) cancers other than lung; (5)  cardiovascular system; and (6) special considerations in children. Appendixes discuss guidelines for public and occupational chemical exposures to materials that are also found in ETS, a method of combining data from studies of ETS exposure and lung cancer, adjustments to epidemiological estimates of excess lung cancer in persons exposed to ETS, and risk assessment for exposure to ETS and lung cancer.

In addition, the content of the beliefs did not seem to act as a strong reinforcer. Thirty-two of the 390 subjects who participated in the original study were interviewed in-depth at a later date to explore the content of their beliefs, how they had come to hold them, and what aspects of religious commitment seemed to yield the most personal reward. A content analysis of the interviews revealed that parents exerted more influence on religiousness than did peers because parents appeared to care more and they reinforced religious participation that was similar to  their own. Religious beliefs seem to be rewarding when they are informed and consistent, but often this is not the case with adolescents. As a consequence, emotional rewards for religiousness are more pervasive and powerful for adolescents than are rewards related directly to the religious beliefs themselves. (Author/NB)",

Intervening in domestic disturbances has long been seen as the single most frequent cause of police deaths. A study was conducted by the National Institute of Justice to examine the danger faced by police when responding to domestic disturbance calls. Previously, data on all disturbance calls had been interpreted as solely or primarily domestic disturbances. In fact, domestic disturbances make up only a small part of the general disturbance category and, when separated, the data revealed that fewer deaths were actually associated with these assignments than previously reported. The findings suggest that the danger to police in domestic disturbance cases has been overstated.  While there is a risk to officers in responding to family violence calls, other police assignments are far more dangerous. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and from seven independent studies were analyzed, revealing that robbery calls were consistently the most dangerous in terms of police officer deaths. This new information should help police chiefs revise and improve training for their officers in how to deal with domestic disturbance calls. (NB)",

Data collected in a state-wide study of civil commitment respondents in North Carolina were used to evaluate the effectiveness of OPC as a less restrictive alternative to involuntary hospitalization. Analysis was limited to civil commitment respondents who were chronically mentally ill, had refused psychiatric medication, and had histories of prior hospitalization and prior dangerousness. This study compared 6-month outcome data for those who were court-ordered to outpatient treatment with those who were released and  those who were committed to the hospital. Multiple outcome measures indicated that respondents ordered to outpatient treatment were as well off as respondents who were released and those who were initially committed to the hospital; and they were significantly more likely to use aftercare services and to continue in treatment. The findings suggest that outpatient commitment is an effective, less restrictive alternative to inpatient commitment for dealing with the chronically mentally ill who revolve in and out of courts and mental hospitals.

        "description":"Most research on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has been medical and most social science research on AIDS has been concerned with social factors in its spread and with social-psychological effects of contracting AIDS. This study was conducted to examine public attitudes toward, and public knowledge about AIDS. Knowledge about AIDS was measured by an index summing correct answers to 15 true-false items based on information readily available to subjects. Attitudes toward AIDS were measured by a set of 18 belief statements concerning persons with AIDS to which subjects agreed or disagreed on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Both instruments were completed by 117 college students. The results suggest that a large majority of college students have basic knowledge of the  mechanisms of AIDS contagion and have little misinformation, yet are limited in their knowledge about its history, progress, and diagnosis. The data also suggest that college students share neither fear of casual contact with, nor moral condemnation of, persons with AIDS. Respondents did show inconsistency between their knowledge and their attitudes. While a majority recognized that AIDS is not spread through casual contact, a majority also expressed aversion toward food preparation and handling by persons with AIDS or by persons living with a person with AIDS. Although a majority of subjects were noncondemning and nonfearful of being in close proximity to persons with AIDS, a minority expressed negative attitudes toward persons with AIDS. (NB)",

It briefly describes a group therapy program for female adolescent survivors of incest offered by a counseling center in Ohio which meets once a week. It explores some of the issues, dynamics, and approaches regarding leadership of such a group. Included are discussions of the difficulties in building group cohesion due to poor social skills of group members, along with the need for universality to overcome feelings of isolation; the leader-directed versus group-directed format; and the benefits and drawbacks of structure in such a group. Six sample activities derived from the expressive arts  therapies are presented and described.

Four absenteeism measures were calculated from personnel records for each month of the year: no pay (the sum of unscheduled, unpaid sick, and leave without pay), part day (the sum of arrived late and left early), paid sick, and total. Analysis was undertaken on the arcsine transformed values to equalize variances. Independent variables were obtained from administrative records and included unit on which the nurse worked, whether or not the nurse was a registered nurse, part- or full-time status, shift, sex, marital status, number of tax exemptions, birth year, and year of employment. Absenteeism was found to be higher on one new unit than on other units, lower  among registered nurses than among other nurses, lower among more senior nursing staff, and higher for employees with a greater number of exemptions taken. Absenteeism was also lower in the winter than at other times of the year. Seniority was the most important explanatory variable, but the effect was approximately linear. A hypothesized burnout pattern predicting that absenteeism would be low initially, would increase after one year, and would be low among nursing staff remaining for 2 years or longer was not found.

Questionnaire research on physical violence in both marital and dating couples has not yet included measures of conventionalization to control for social desirability. This study was conducted to examine the relationship between coercion and conventionalization in dating couples. Undergraduate students (N=488) completed a measure of coercion, defined as verbal and/or physical behaviors to compel compliance, and a conventionalization measure concerning their current or most recent dating relationship. The results indicated that increased conventionalization was  associated with increased depth of involvement, increased duration of the relationship, decreased levels of coercion, and an ongoing versus past relationship.

        "description":"A central component of anorexia nervosa is a body image disturbance (BID). BID, as it is experienced in anorexia nervosa, is defined as an inability to recognize how thin one really is and is exhibited by a sense of feeling overweight in spite of severe emaciation. Several researchers have recognized a relationship between depressive personality traits and a negative body image. This study was conducted to investigate whether there exists a predispositional link between feelings of depression and the onset of BID. Female college students (N=110) with different levels of depression were asked to estimate their body size after being given feedback that they either weighed three percent more or less than they actually did. As predicted, females who had personality traits of  depression had a body image that was more vulnerable to the external feedback than did their less depressed counterparts. The external feedback in the study was designed to simulate a possible mechanism that underlies the societal messages American females are constantly confronted with about their weight. The results can aid in understanding the etiology of body image disturbance and offer important implications for the treatment and prevention of BID and anorexia nervosa. (Author/NB)",

Risk factors associated with adolescent suicide, personality traits of high-risk adolescents, and the contagion effect of adolescent suicide are discussed. A chapter on the response to suicide focuses on intervention, prevention, and reaction. The formation of a school crisis team is explained and suggested procedures for the team to use in dealing with suicide-related referrals are listed. A reaction outline  presents a compilation of several school districts' responses to student suicides. It is noted that the model presented can be adjusted to address suicide attempts or other emotionally catastrophic events. Eleven recommendations by the Sudden Adolescent Death Committee concerning an adolescent suicide are listed. The final section discusses an early detection and treatment program for adolescent suicide prevention. An epilogue contains a statement of suicide addressed to the Grosse Pointe, Michigan community.

Two survey instruments, one for elementary school principals and one for superintendents, were developed. Results from surveys completed by 350 elementary school principals and 85 school superintendents revealed five major findings: (1) principals and superintendents supported the elementary guidance and counseling program; (2) both principals and superintendents strongly supported the existing certification requirements for counselors;  (3) fewer than one-third of respondents had attended a state department of education regional orientation meeting on the new guidance and counseling program; (4) when ranking functions of elementary school guidance counselors, respondents chose as most important the provision of individual and group counseling for students; and (5) respondents ranked &quot;funding a qualified, full-time guidance counselor&quot; as their major concern about implementation of the program, and &quot;availability of fully qualified guidance personnel&quot; as their second concern.

The other theories are those which hold that homicide is a function of cultural norms which support violence and of a weak system of social control. The regression analysis also included three control variables: urbanization, percent black, and the percent of families with incomes below the federal poverty level. The regressions were replicated for the overall homicide rate, and for homicides of family members, acquaintances, and strangers. Results of these analyses: (1) confirmed an earlier finding using 1976 data showing a strong relationship between an index of the stressfulness of states and  regions and the total homicide rate; (2) found a similar relationship of stress to family and acquaintance homicide but not to homicide of strangers; and (3) found that the stress-homicide relationship held even when effects of some of the other major variables that have been used to explain homicide were allowed, including cultural support for violence, weak social control, economic deprivation, urbanization, and a large minority population. These results suggest the relevance of social stress in understanding homicide. The stress theory does not appear to be simply a restatement of some of the better established themes of homicide reported. (ABL)",

        "description":"In comparative studies of homicide, many theories compete. This study examined two established theories, stress theory and culture of violence theory, in terms of their ability to explain state-to-state differences in the rate of highly specific types of homicides. The separate and joint effects on homicide committed by handguns, shoulder guns, sharp and blunt instruments, and the mediating role of availability of weapons in the relationship were studied. The investigation was based on homicide data for the United States for 1980-1984, with states serving as the units of analysis. Results showed that legitimate violence was associated with gun ownership, which in turn was associated with homicidal violence. The findings suggest that the institutionalization of violence at the  collective level for socially legitimate purposes provides a model which encourages individuals to purchase a gun for self-protection, and the presence of guns increases the risk of an assault becoming lethal.

        "description":"This critical review of &quot;Becoming a Nation of Readers&quot; states that the Commission on Reading report contains sensible and practical recommendations, though it is not wholly representative of all the available research on reading and it contains occasional insensitivities to the potential problems within its recommendations. The first chapter of the report describes skilled reading as a process in which good readers use their prior knowledge to construct meaning from the text, thus setting the tone for the remainder of the report, which does not contain much new information on reading instruction. The chapter on emerging literacy recommends that phonics be taught early and be completed by the end of second grade, which could lead to an overreaction on the part of some, and that  children be instructed to read silently before they read orally, which seems reasonable. The chapter on extending literacy recommends that teachers avoid relying solely on readability formulas for determining text difficulty. Direct teaching of comprehension instruction is highly recommended. Finally, the chapter on teachers' educational and professional development notes several issues and recommendations: higher admission standards for prospective teachers, improved salaries, lengthening of the teacher preparation program, transition programs for novice teachers, greater attention to the professional development of veteran teachers, and effective school climates for promoting literacy. This review concludes that &quot;Becoming a Nation of Readers&quot; deserves to be read not so much for the  research behind it as for the practicality of the recommendations growing out of that research.

In the morning message, the first activity of the day, the teacher and students read and discussed a simple message written on the board, thereby introducing various writing conventions. Process writing time, during which students were asked to write the teacher a message, followed the morning message, and consisted of three phases: pre-writing discussion, writing and conferring, and sharing. The acceptance of illustrations  and inventive spelling stressed the communicative nature of writing. Both of these reading/writing activities were implemented in 16 classrooms, and results illustrated different patterns of implementation, leading to the conclusion that activities are modified to fit within the constraints of each classroom setting.

        "description":"Although listening provides a foundation for all aspects of language and cognitive development and plays a lifelong role in the processes of learning and communication essential to productive participation in life, there is a tendency for teachers not to emphasize listening objectives. Even though no widely accepted model for listening has been developed, several researchers have linked listening skills to reading skills, and processing models for reading contribute to the understanding of listening. The developing discussion of listening has contributed to directions in the classroom. Choate and Rakes (1987), for example, present a structured listening activity not unlike one that would promote reading comprehension. Questioning, usually by the teacher, is the key to most of the  instructional strategies in the literature about teaching listening. Although some argue that listening should be taught as a separate mode, the tendency of many teaching methodologies and techniques on listening to draw on theory, objectives, and skills more established in the other language modes seems reasonable.

        "description":"To investigate how Mexican-American students constructed meaning from English texts when engaged in reading and writing activities, a study examined 12 fifth grade Mexican-American students who lived in a &quot;barrio&quot; with literacy in both Spanish and English. The aim was to tap the envisionments (text interpretations or understandings, and expectations of what a particular text will include) students developed over time. During a series of research sessions, students read four passages--two in English and two in Spanish--in two genres, story and report. In each session students responded to envisionment and probing questions, gave oral retellings of the passages at various points, and wrote story summaries. Bilingual researchers conducted the sessions, and students were told to use  either language--throughout the sessions, researchers mirrored the students' language lead. Findings indicated that good reading strategies made a difference in students' text comprehension in both languages, and that students' familiarity with genre affected their ability to build appropriate meanings. Also, question types affected students' ability to communicate what they understood. Finally, all students exhibited the ability to gain meaning from phrases in context and to explain what they meant, although the better envisionment makers provided more &quot;school like&quot; explanations. And all students exhibited greater comprehension of the English texts than would be expected based on reading comprehension test scores. (Eleven tables are included, and a student interview form, reading  passages, envisionment questions, probing questions, tree diagrams for analysis of recalls, and 25 references are appended.) (MM)",

In the spring of 1986, students were given the reading subtests of the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) Primary 1 level. The study also included a teacher &quot;checklist&quot; evaluation of students' performance on 30 communication arts skills. Teachers and administrators were asked to complete a questionnaire on their opinions about the MAT, the &quot;checklist&quot; and their general views on  assessing first graders. Results revealed wide variation in reading test scores among first graders, children who participated in early childhood education programs performed significantly better on the standardized tests than children with no school experiences before first grade. Nearly 37% of the sample was reading at or above grade level. Checklist results showed that over two-thirds of the children could perform basic reading skills, though fewer than half could routinely perform more complex reading skills. Survey results indicated that teachers and administrators felt that the checklist was not comprehensive enough to be the only measure of reading performance.

        "description":"This paper reviews political symbols aimed at the United States found in &quot;Granma Weekly Review&quot; and in Fidel Castro's speeches to see if they have changed in a predicted manner over an 18-year period and whether changes in symbol content of &quot;Granma&quot; and Castro's speeches correspond. The paper first explains the functions of the Cuban media, and then recounts the history and status of U.S.-Cuban relations. Next, the paper examines Castro's attitude toward the United States. The paper then analyzes the 100 most-used symbols referring to the United States in &quot;Granma&quot; and finds similar symbol usage in Castro's speeches during years researchers thought to be periods of closer relations between the United States and Cuba. However, researchers found that the frequency of symbol usage in&quot;Granma&quot; was not similar to that found in Castro's speeches. The paper suggests that the message Castro presents in his speeches is a complex one--the message he is sending to the world community through interviews and other statements is inconsistent with the aggressive language contained in his speeches where symbol usage reflects overt Cuban policy. The paper finds that before 1974, &quot;Granma&quot; and Castro's speeches were similar in their use of aggressive symbols, but since then the use of aggressive symbols in &quot;Granma&quot; has been a better indicator of Cuban policy. Seven tables of data, nine figures of data matrix, and 67 notes are included. (MS)",

The article investigates how the Hong Kong press, which spans the entire left-center-right ideological spectrum, has begun to adapt its &quot;journalistic paradigms&quot; because of the political transition. The paper also (1) develops the concept of &quot;journalistic paradigm&quot; (taken-for-granted and unspoken assumptions); (2) traces the emergence of a dualistic power structure (colonial and Xinhau [New China] News Agency) in Hong Kong; (3) examines political ideology and partisan affiliation of the press; and (4) compares the direction and magnitude  of editorial paradigm shifts in relation to press ideology. A content analysis of several newspapers, reported in the paper, reveals that the shifts of the &quot;journalistic paradigms&quot; are contingent upon the press' political affiliations--the rightist press has gradually converged with the centrist press, shifting from an initial stance favoring continued British rule to accommodate the PRC's takeover of Hong Kong, and the leftist press has reduced its anti-colonial overtone.

        "description":"A study investigated the effects of using a computer image projected on a large screen to teach revision to college students. Subjects, 19 students at DePauw University, enrolled in a writing intensive literature course in a Writing across the Curriculum program, were divided into test and control groups. It was hypothesized that the modeling of collaborative revision on the computer in the classroom would lead to (1) the submission of better student papers; (2) greater changes in the student's writing process, especially a deeper definition of revision; and (3) more positive attitudes toward peer collaboration, than would teaching revision through discussion of a fixed text. Conclusions were reached on the basis of instructors' and blind readers' grades on 114 papers (drafts and  revisions), questionnaires on writing attitudes and processes, student self-reports, and classroom observation. Findings revealed that the mean scores of papers for all students increased, but there was no statistically significant difference in mean scores from the test and control groups. Although it was impossible to determine the effect of the computer revision sessions upon attitudes toward peer collaboration, the survey and observations suggested that the use of the computer in the classroom helped students improve their writing, raised their consciousness about the composing process, and helped them develop a more radical definition of revision, than the use of a fixed text.

Through the process of searching for the authentic voice, the document arrives at 12 conclusions, including the following: (1) the nature of an authentic voice, if it exists, is protean and shifty; (2) most published voices are carefully constructed to present the self in particular ways; (3) authentic voices can best be found by looking at whole pieces of discourse, and by looking at samples written to different audiences for different purposes; (4) writing voices are unlikely to be characterized by the smaller technical units of composition; (5) when  people hear a voice in writing, they most likely hear a &quot;tone&quot; characteristic of the writer's public personality; (6) the specific topic of a person's writing is a strong determiner of voice; and (7) a writer's attitude or viewpoint toward material is a stronger determiner of voice than any specific linguistic trait. The author concluded that he has one public voice (as do most writers), and this &quot;authentic voice&quot; is the voice that the public finds in his writing. Also, the private voice resembles other private voices more than it does an author's public voice. (ARH)",

        "description":"Advising high school publications is a difficult task that makes it necessary to ascertain the needs and perceptions of high school journalism teachers and advisers. In an attempt to identify problems faced by high school journalism advisers in Arkansas and to determine what would prevent these advisers from using just one of the common aids available to them, the university-sponsored workshop, a study surveyed the opinions of journalism advisers. Subjects, 94 high school journalism advisers (76% in schools of less than 700 students), responded to a questionnaire about problems relating to student publications and the possibility of attending journalism workshops. Their responses indicated that their major problems concerned students' poor newswriting skills; lack of money and  resources; photography; lack of time; inability to meet deadlines; students' lack of motivation and commitment; and students' lack of layout and design skills. Schedule conflicts, as well as lack of money, time, and administrative approval, were identified as the reasons most likely to prevent them from taking their students to journalism workshops. Results show that a need for traditional &quot;skills&quot; workshops for high school journalism students still exists, but that there also is a need for workshops which will help advisers solve time and money problems, as well as difficulties involving student commitment and motivation.

The highly detailed syllabus is a matter of personal choice, often influenced by the caliber and the preparation of students, and not requisite for the perfect syllabus.

A serious problem with the use of the writing process approach is that very little is actually known about the writing process. Writing is supremely complex and intensely personal, and is essentially a hidden process, studied only through observation of the writer in action, analysis of the verbalizations of the writer as he or she writes, analysis of the comments of the writer about the writing, and analysis of the written product. Professional opinions differ on whether process writing is a boon or a blight for education, and recently critics have begun to question the value of process writing. On the  credit side, the process writing movement has redressed the imbalance in the focus on writing in schools as distinct from the previous focus on reading. However, research with sixth grade writers revealed that children need to be taught to write. The great flaw in process writing is that it places far too much emphasis on children writing and talking and not enough emphasis on teachers teaching children to write. The skills required to write well are many and varied and cannot be mastered by accident.

First, the paper traces the evolution of conflicting educational ideologies within the American judicial system. Next, the paper attempts to demonstrate that &quot;Hazelwood&quot; is not just another move by a conservative Court to  restrain individual liberties but represents a belief that school officials should be accorded substantial deference in their formulation and implementation of educational policy. The paper also explores several rationales for a diminished (&quot;limited capacity&quot;) free expression right within the public academy, the cumulative effect of which should be to allow teachers and school officials to inculcate immature minds with a sense of social responsibility and morality without irreparably impairing the aspiring young journalist's enthusiasm for individual self-expression. The paper concludes that &quot;Hazelwood&quot; represents a restoration of the proper balance between the pedagogical mission of the public schools and the role of the student press.

        "description":"To test the argument that writing instructors should not teach word processing skills in computer-assisted composition classes, two qualitative studies were conducted. In the first study, three basic writers, two native speakers and one non-native speaker in a word processing/composition class at The Ohio State University were each extensively observed completing an assigned essay. Data included all drafts of each assigned essay; as well as observations of students writing in their classroom, dormitories, and computer lab, and taped and written interviews with the subjects and their instructors. Results showed that the students, who were given little guidance in integrating the computer into their composing processes, overlooked almost half of the important word processing  options available. The fact that basic writers do little prewriting or rewriting and may have limited short term memories probably interfered with their fuller use of the word processor. Yet, results of a five-month participant-observation in industry also show a counterproductive ignorance of word processing options. In order to instill and evaluate the important benefits of computer-assisted composition classes, teachers may need to give &quot;hands-on&quot; instruction throughout the term. In industry, user groups may greatly improve writing efficiency. (One table is included and 10 references are attached.) (ARH)",

        "description":"The United States Supreme Court case, Meese v. Keene, in which the justices narrowly defined the meaning of the term &quot;political propaganda,&quot; failed to address adequately the complexities of the issue. In this case it is necessary to bring together divergent views about communications in the analysis of the legal problem, including historical methods of information control, case law, the arguments in the case, social science findings, and press model research. The case centered on the right of the government to label certain films as &quot;political propaganda.&quot; In Meese v. Keene the Court: (1) failed to deal with the questions about persuasion from the body of knowledge that exists; (2) considered some and rejected other &quot;evidence&quot; without regard for the role of theory in science; (3)  took a very limited view of social science research as evidence; and (4) did not consider studies on the role of free expression in democracies. The majority in Meese v. Keene took the view that the term &quot;political propaganda&quot; is neutral, but except for the narrow legal fiction of statutory language, this cannot be satisfactory. The dissenters argued that the label burdens discourse without serving a strong governmental interest. Rather than promoting pluralism, the use suggests a singular view of &quot;truth.&quot; (Ninety-five notes are included.) (MS)",

        "description":"Employing data from the 1986 Inland Daily Newspaper Association Cost and Revenue study effects of scale on the costs of various factors in newspaper production were examined. Despite several limitations of the Inland Survey, the following tentative conclusions were reached: total expenses rise faster than circulation, and total revenues rise faster still. Big newspapers make (and spend) proportionally more money than smaller newspapers. As newspapers grow in circulation, they also grow in bulk. Findings show that if news-editorial quality can be operationalized as expenditures, then it is better to have a single large daily than two half its size. This seems to dispel the notion that quality is enhanced by competition. However, an adequate operationalization of &quot;quality&quot; as money  spent on newspaper departments is lacking in the data. For all their value in demonstrating the consequences of scale, the Inland data do not present the market antecedents necessary for an adequate test of the &quot;quality&quot; assumption.

        "description":"Controversy and debate can be effectively employed as the central pre-writing activity in the composition classroom. The current model of prewriting in the composition classroom is the reflective model, which involves relatively private exploration of issues and ideas leading to paper topics. Although in the short run it is easier for both student and instructor to stress personal discovery through composition and to accentuate agreement and common ground between writer and reader, in the long run students benefit from being compelled to confront one another. In the initial stages at least, invention is primarily a process of discovering how one disagrees with a viable opposition. Thus, students learn to write with conviction and integrity when they have a firm grasp of their  opponent's viewpoint. In addition, the confrontational approach is closer to the spirit of Renaissance humanism and the tradition of liberal arts education than is reflective invention. A practical example of the confrontational approach involves examination of texts by William James and Sigmund Freud. James'&quot;The Will to Believe&quot; presents a powerful, complex argument praising religious faith, while Freud's &quot;The Future of an Illusion&quot; presents a counter-argument stressing the importance of science. By featuring the clash between James and Freud, the stage is set for profound disagreement, which fuels student discussion and debate, and in turn provides students a reference for their theses.

        "description":"The writing center is a logical setting for assisting the culturally dissonant student. Although the education of ethnic minority youth is one of the major tasks confronting American society and public higher education, teaching methods remain oriented to the values of a predominantly white middle class population. As a result, non-traditional (ethnic minority and working class) students often experience cultural dissonance in the classroom, a dissonance perhaps manifested most acutely when they encounter a writing assignment. Through sensitive peer tutoring and a \"hands-off\" approach to writing instruction, the writing center helps to empower the non-traditional student, and provides an ideal place for students to begin to cope with the culture of academia. The recruiting and  training of tutors, especially peer tutors, are key factors in the development of the writing center. In an environment with culturally diverse writers, peer tutoring develops a different value and dimension. By actively recruiting tutors who reflect the cultural, gender, and class diversity of the student population, and by training all tutors to become sensitive to stereotyping, cultural orientation, and learning styles, the writing center can address the complex experience of non-traditional students and serve a facilitating and liberating function for writers unfamiliar with academic discourse. Writings by clients and tutors at the writing center at the University of Washington reveal the success such a program can yield. (ARH)",

Twenty-four classes were studied--twelve control classes and twelve experimental--with the experimental computer classes meeting in the lab for half of their instructional time. Data on the success of the program were collected from a range of sources: pre- and posttests of student writing under both impromptu and take-home conditions; pre- and posttests of writing anxiety; records on attendance, tardiness, withdrawals, and homework and essay assignment completion; end-of-term course evaluation by both teachers and students; and self-report data collected from teacher meetings and teacher logs.  Results favored the use of computers, with computer students revising and improving their posttest essays (especially discourse-level features) at levels that are significantly better than regular students. Those students in experimental sections who chose to compose on computers at the end of the term outperformed the group as a whole and performed significantly better than those experimental students who chose to compose with pen and paper. Attitudinal data from both students and teachers also favored the use of computers.

Divided into four parts, the survey begins with a review of the correspondence between Willkie and such journalists as Marquis Childs, Drew Pearson, and Arthur Krock, illuminating relationships between the press and public figures in the 1940s. The second section focuses primarily on the relations between Willkie and the Cowles brothers in their efforts to win for Willkie the Republican nomination and the presidency in 1940 and the nomination again in 1944. In this context, consideration is given to how the Cowles brothers managed their  potentially conflicting roles as publishers and would-be president makers. Part 3 considers the 1942 &quot;One World&quot; trip--the 49-day around-the-world diplomatic tour that Willkie took with Mike Cowles--further examining how Cowles handled the often simultaneous roles as journalist, government official, and close friend and supporter of a presidential candidate. Finally, the fourth section provides discussion, conclusions, and recommendations for future research in this area. (A list of 123 footnotes is appended.) (MM)",

All freedom of expression decisions were analyzed for the 16 years of the Warren Court, 1953-69, and the 17 years of the Burger Court, 1969-86. Data indicated that the Warren Court (1) did not become significantly involved in libel until the last six of its 16 years when it created the actual malice rule; (2) averaged two libel decisions per year; and (3) heard 16% of libel appeals. The Burger Court averaged 1.2 libel decisions per  year and heard 6% of the libel cases appealed to it. During its last six years, the Warren Court was more of an activist court in the area of libel than the Burger Court.

Results indicated that the lawmakers were polarized in their response to the question of whether the community newspaper was a help or a hindrance to their objectives as public officials. In addition, most respondents were neutral in responses to the question of whether they viewed the reporters assigned to them as adversary, supporter, friend, or opponent. More than half of the officials agreed that  assigning a black reporter to the lawmaker's office would help the newspaper understand black issues and concerns. Overall, findings suggest that the black state legislator has an unfavorable view of local paper performance, with most seeing the community press as obsessed with conflict coverage. The hometown paper's coverage of the lawmaker's office was judged as particularly poor compared to statehouse specialist reporters. Few black legislators in the 1980s feel fairly treated, and they feel that whites have more influence at the community newspaper and receive more favorable news coverage.

        "author":["Beam, Randal A."],
        "description":"Although professionalism has been an important concept to American journalists for over a century, no consensus exists regarding what concepts like profession, professionalism, and professionalization mean. Three basic traditions have dominated the sociological literature on professionalism: (1) the phenomenological approach, which advocates studying the way ordinary members of an occupation invoke the term in everyday usage; (2) the power approach, which addresses professionalization issues as a political process; and (3) open-system models of organization, which state that organizations are composed of loosely coupled parts, and that environmental factors play a prominent role in the functioning of an organization. Open-system models of organization and power models of  professions can be joined to develop a new conceptual framework for professionalism. Under this new framework, professionalism is conceptualized at the organizational level rather than the individual level, as has been the case with most previous studies of professionalism in journalism. Occupational groups, in this model, vary in their degree of professionalization by the degree of control they secure over their work. For less powerful occupations, such as journalism, the degree of organizational professionalism reflects the extent to which workers are perceived by the organization's dominant coalition as essential to that organization's effective functioning. This organizational-level conceptualization of professionalism is useful when studying the actions of organizations and  organizational output, as opposed to the attitudes and values of individual journalists.

Both groups also participated in identical spelling activities and study assignments throughout the year. The two groups varied only with respect to the methods of administering the weekly spelling test. Two pretest measures of spelling ability were used--the spelling scores from the Science  Research Associates (SRA) achievement test, and a 40-word spelling test developed specifically for this study. The posttest consisted of 20 words randomly selected from the 720-word spelling list for the year, and 20 words randomly selected from the fourth-grade section of the vocabulary list developed by the State Department of Education in Nebraska. Findings indicated that students achieved higher scores on the dictated word-sentence-word method than on the dictated-sentence method. (Five references are appended.) (MM)",

Soon after it was created on December 19, 1941, the office issued a voluntary wartime code of practices for newspapers, magazines, and periodicals which asked editors to act according to whether they thought the information in their possession was of use to the enemy. For the next three years the appearance of stories on heavy water and atom smashing became a problem which the Office of Censorship had to monitor continually by issuing confidential notes to editors of newspapers and weeklies as well as managers of  radio stations. The Office of Censorship also was frantically battling leaks outside of mainstream magazines and newspapers, such as book publishers, &quot;appropriate authorities,&quot; and universities. This lasted until the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, at which point the Office of Censorship's Press Division took the view that virtually anything was permissible except a description of how the atom was split or the internal workings of the bomb. Remarkably, throughout the war, the press did bear with the government policy of revealing virtually no technical details about the bomb, primarily because it enthusiastically supported the war. The voluntary form of censorship had worked. (Seventy-three notes are included.) (MS)",

        "description":"A study tested the data-ink ratio theory, which holds that a reader's recall of quantitative data displayed in a graph containing a substantial amount of non-data-ink will be significantly less than recall from a graph containing little non-data-ink, as it might apply to graphics used in mass circulation newspapers. The experiment employed a between subjects, posttest only control group design. The stimuli were ten simple, horizontal bar graphs taken from the &quot;Snapshot&quot; section of &quot;USA Today.&quot; All had familiar labels and no value was more than three digits long. The control stimuli were created to serve the role of identical graphs with much of the non-data-ink erased. The 120 observers were students in two sophomore level classes taught at the School of Journalism at Indiana  University. The questions, which were constructed to measure the observer's accuracy in making comparisons between the data groups and accuracy in recalling the exact numbers associated with each data group, probed information such as number of bars displayed in the graph, labels associated with certain graphs, numerical value given to graphs, and relative length of bars in graphs. Observers were given 15 seconds to examine the data contained in the graphs. Statistical analysis of results showed that control groups and treatment groups made a nearly identical number of errors. Further examination of the results indicated that no single graph produced a significant difference between the control and treatment conditions.

        "description":"To determine how journalists at two metropolitan newspapers view good writing and writing coaches, questionnaires were distributed to all full-time newsroom personnel (including journalists and editors) involved in preparation of news at two large dailies under the same ownership in the same city, in July, 1986. The total number of respondents was 125, half responding from the morning paper, and half from the evening paper (an overall response rate of 66%). The papers did not employ internal writing coaches but on occasion brought in an outside coach. Findings indicated that many journalists at both newspapers felt their papers had a strong commitment to good writing. Most of the respondents said their writing had been praised, if infrequently. However, journalists perceived  little evidence of rewriting or willingness to experiment with writing at their papers. The major contributors to good writing in the newsroom were seen as experienced/motivated reporters and good editor-reporter rapport. One-half of the reporters said editors are more likely to hurt writing than to help it. Newsroom procedures and deadline pressures were identified as the greatest obstacles to good writing. The vast majority of journalists felt that a writing coach could make a more in favor of coaches than were their colleagues on the morning paper, and reporters were more supportive of the idea than were editors.

Both photographs and editorial texts were considered, and coding was done by race: White, Black, other or mixed. Within each category, subcoding was done to determine whether the item was positive, neutral or negative. The results were tabulated and graphed by issue and by four-month period: pre-protest (May through August 1986), Protest (September through December 1986) and post-protest (January through April 1987). Findings indicated that the &quot;Post&quot; provided little neutral or positive coverage of Blacks in the four months before the 1986  protest. Coverage of Blacks became fuller and more positive during the protest, and remained positive and increased further after the protest. During the final four months, coverage of Blacks rose to near parity with the percentage of Blacks in the metropolitan population, and coverage was noticeably more positive. Photographs and illustrations, however, have not reflected the changes made in editorial coverage, and Blacks are still noticeably absent from ads, as well. (ARH)",

        "description":"Several events in 1987--including the publication of Ernest L. Boyer's &quot;College: The Undergraduate Experience in America&quot; and the second edition of the &quot;Oregon Report&quot;--reflect the developments in curriculum reform in journalism and mass communication education. Boyer's &quot;enriched major&quot; perspective (stating that general and specialized education should be viewed as contributing to common, not competing, goals) is a major step toward increasing both respect and reform in journalism and mass communication programs in the context of overall undergraduate reform. This concept provides a broad framework in which undergraduate pre-professional fields, such as mass communication, can become part of liberal education. To facilitate reform, mass communication educators need to: (1)  evaluate themselves and their course offerings in light of what is fundamental and common to the field of mass communication; (2) push to include mass communication (now a major force in modern society) in the core curriculum of every university; (3) more forcefully and effectively articulate to media professionals their liberal and general education role; and (4) join with business, engineering, education, computer science, and other educators in appropriate pre-professional fields to determine points of commonality. These four steps should not only help liberate liberal education, but also help liberate journalism and mass communication programs from their peripheral role in undergraduate education and provide coherence in understanding the media.

        "description":"A study of reader response to newspaper articles in a defamatory context tested: (1) the judicial assumption that the macro-environment in which statements appear is important to a reader's distinguishing between fact and opinion; (2) the possibility that a byline may influence a reader's characterization of statements; and (3) the idea that people react differently to opinion than to fact. Since American libel law protects statements of opinion and finds only fact statements defamatory, an understanding of how readers distinguish between opinion and fact is crucial to attorneys, judges, journalists and publishers. Subjects, 57 Stanford University (California) students, read a mock newspaper in which two articles appeared on a news page and two were on an editorial page, and were  asked to rate the articles as to their opinion or fact nature and to assess the person being defamed by the articles. Findings indicated that the macro-context strongly influences reader perception, so that an article appearing on the editorial page is more likely to be considered opinion than when that same article appears on the news page. The presence or absence of a byline was not found to influence the fact/opinion distinction. Surprisingly, statements perceived to be opinions were more influential in assessing the defamed person's reputation than statements perceived as facts.

        "description":"A study investigated whether three types of journalistic material--news stories, news articles, and news reports--could be reliably distinguished from one another, and whether these genres had differential appeal to audiences. News reports are defined as succinct reports of facts, while news articles represent a more analytic form of reporting, and news stories have traces of literary quality. A content analysis of the November 1, 1985 issue of the Richmond &quot;News Leader&quot; was combined with an existing readership survey of that issue. Ninety-seven news stories were classified by two coders according to the categories of reports, articles, and stories. Respondents, 357 adult residents of Richmond, Virginia, were questioned by professional interviewers, who determined whether readers&quot;noticed,&quot;&quot;read some,&quot; or &quot;read most&quot; of all items in the newspaper of 30 lines or longer. Answers were then weighted to represent 514 cases. Findings revealed that intercoder reliability was high; thus, it was possible to distinguish reports from stories. (There were no articles in this issue of the paper.) Mean readership attention scores (combining the readership of persons of both sexes, and various ages, incomes, and educational levels) revealed that reports and stories received significantly different browsing attention, with stories winning more attention than reports. On the other hand, reports received significantly higher attention than stories when the criterion was reading more than half of the full text. (Two references and three tables are attached.) (ARH)",

        "description":"The nature and function of news in the public life of seventeenth-century New England and the legacy this conception of news left for the development of American newspaper journalism in the eighteenth century are explored in this paper. The paper argues that the origin of American news--its subject matter, style, and method of reporting--is deeply rooted in the religious culture of seventeenth-century New England and that the doctrine of divine providence helped to shape the nature of news and news reporting in America. The publications of Samuel Danforth, Increase Mather, and his son, Cotton Mather, all leading seventeenth-century religious figures, are examined in the paper to illustrate the eclectic, reportorial method of inquiry. The paper claims that the characteristics of  news and news reporting that emerged in seventeenth-century New England--event orientation, supported by reportorial empiricism and authoritative interpretation--left an ambiguous legacy, a legacy for &quot;both&quot; orthodoxy and heresy in modern American journalism. The paper concludes that Puritanism in America provided a rich environment for the growth of news and for the growth of a particular methodology for identifying, gathering, reporting, and publishing news stories, and that for the most part, the first newspapers, such as the &quot;Boston News-Letter,&quot; continued the news reporting style that had been central to the teleological news system of seventeenth-century New England.

Analysis revealed that the use of writing-to-learn shifted the emphasis from content to critical thinking. Informal writing helped students not only to &quot;unpack&quot; dense metaphoric language to reach clearer analytic insights--it also helped students to engage texts on a more personal level by allowing  the literature to intersect with their own experiences. Informal writing also helped to develop students' ability to synthesize larger masses of material. This use of informal writing was significant because it nurtured critical thinking skills and allowed students to find their own voices in their writing, which gave more vitality to their transactional writing.

Although the study focused on Herbst's reporting from Cuba and Germany, other writings were examined, including several fictional pieces, memoirs, and literary criticism. Herbst's work was analyzed according to several criteria. Each piece was reviewed for its stylistic characteristics--language usage, narrative form, source use and balance, and readability. Background material on the thirties provides context not only for Herbst's politics, experiences, and social views, but also for her writing style and genre choices. Analysis revealed that Herbst's choice of topics was motivated by her Marxist politics. Analysis also showed that  Herbst's writing has been overlooked in journalism history, and although her sex and politics may be enough to generate renewed interest in her, the justification for consideration of her work rests on its ability to capture a sense of time and people otherwise lost in &quot;missing moments&quot; of history.

Responses were received from 558 students (a 21% response rate), with a high ratio of generally academically superior and non-minority female students. Respondents answered a 29-item survey concerning 29 essential competencies considered crucial to the language arts programs in secondary schools (including the ability to organize writing for a specific purpose, and the ability to edit the writing of others). For each of the competencies, students were asked to rate their experiences in the three areas that applied to their high school language arts classes--standard  (required) English, journalism courses, and other English electives (speech, drama, creative writing, etc.). Students also responded to an open-ended question asking for suggestions for high school language arts teachers. Results revealed that, when compared to students with no high school journalism experience, students who took at least one journalism course rated it as fulfilling the general language arts competencies better in 16 of the 29 competencies. When the competencies were collapsed into six categories, students rated journalism courses superior in four of them: writing, editing, gathering/use of sources, and affective domain. On the open-ended question, among the most-mentioned of college students' suggestions for high school language arts teachers were to: (1) teach basic  writing skills; (2) develop and encourage various writing styles; and (3) assign more writing.

Subjects, 49 college students in introductory journalism classes, were given a pretest consisting of ten sentences containing 27 style errors. Based on results from this test, students were randomly assigned to the traditional or computer treatment in a high knowledge or low knowledge classification. Students assigned to the traditional treatment were given a printed exercise of ten sentences containing 25 style errors relating specifically to capitalization and abbreviation rules. Using the AP Style Manual, students corrected the sentences,  noting the time they began and ended the task. Students assigned to the computer group used the style manual to correct errors in the same ten sentences appearing on the computer screen. The computer program presented the sentences with three increasingly specific levels of feedback explaining usage errors. As students completed the practice exercise, they were given a printed sheet containing ten new sentences, testing the same rules. Using the traditional pencil and paper method, all students were asked to correct the errors without referring to the style manual. Results indicated that CAI had a significant effect on students' ability to apply correctly the AP style rules. The major difference appeared to be the feedback the CAI system provided.

For this study, data on OCLC was gathered intensively over a period of 18 months, beginning in 1979 and periodically in the  years since that time. An argument is made in the paper for viewing information systems from a socio-technical perspective as early as possible in the design stage of innovation, since without consideration of the social, an idealized technical design concept may not move forward as a practical social system as it has been conceived. The literature of action research is reviewed for its relevant application to the generation of innovation, and several essential arguments are derived from the study.

        "author":["Calabrese, Andrew M."],
        "description":"Focusing particularly on communication as a discipline, this paper is a review and synthesis of literature about scholarly communication in the social sciences. Drawing from literature about ferment in the communication discipline, from information science, the sociology of knowledge, and the philosophy of social science, the paper argues that social theories do not and need not fall within disciplinary boundaries. The paper observes that many of the reasons why disciplines come to be defined as they do is more related to historical accident than to conceptual rigor. Institutional inertia exerts a powerful restraint against interdisciplinary social research through the maintenance of academic departments, associations and journals and the reward structures they impose. However,  the mere fact of the existence of these forces is not a conceptually defensible basis for discouraging interdisciplinary research. The paper also argues that the ubiquity of human communication demands a theoretical perspective that is not subject to rigid boundaries of specialization. The felt need to develop a paradigm of communication is evidenced in the recent literature about intellectual ferment among communication scholars. The paper notes that communication theory has begun to be equated with social theory in general through the work of scholars such as Habermas. In that light, human communication can be seen as a central element in all social research. This is a unique feature that sets communication apart as an interdisciplinary &quot;discipline.&quot; (A four-page bibliography and 15  notes are attached.) (Author/JK)",

        "description":"To prepare college graduates for careers in the magazine publishing industry, a magazine curriculum requires a complex array of disparate courses. Small colleges offer the best environment for reformatting magazine education. In order for a magazine curriculum to develop, grow, and thrive it must have access to students with specialized interests as well as to generalists, and this is more easily accomplished in a non-restrictive small college environment where students are encouraged to cross disciplinary lines. The publishing overview accurately presages the entry level positions that graduates will find open to them in the industry. In addition to basic journalistic writing skills, training is required in graphics, word processing, promotion and public relations, and the legal  aspects of publishing. The decision to initiate a publishing major or sequence rests on the ready availability of certain courses in the curriculum, a local pool of adjunct faculty talent, and a market for the program based on potential students and employment data in the region served by the college. At Loyola College of Maryland, a typical program of study includes: (1) a common liberal arts core; (2) a communications core; (3) seven major courses, including manuscript evaluation and editing, writing book review and promotional copy, magazine article writing; (4) five interdepartmental courses; and (5) optional communications electives.

Students from the following primary placement categories were represented: regular education/high risk, compensatory education, specific learning disabilities, emotionally handicapped, severely language impaired, educable mentally handicapped, regular education, and gifted. Speech-language clinicians screened the students using the &quot;Clinical Evaluation of Language Functions (CELF) Advanced Level Screening Test.&quot; The 11 basic subtests of the CELF Diagnostic and the Processing  Speech Sounds supplementary subtest were administered to 131 of the students who failed the screening (those students classified as Educable Mentally Handicapped were not further evaluated). Findings revealed that of the 290 students screened statewide, 194 or 67% failed the screening. Of the total sample screened, 266 or 92% were high risk students, as defined previously. Rates of failure for each primary placement category were also calculated. In viewing the percentage of failure on specific subtests, patterns emerge across and within placement categories. In addition, findings showed that only 20% of the students who failed the screening were enrolled in speech therapy. When severely language impaired students were excluded from the data, only 9% of the remaining high risk group who  failed the screening were receiving speech-language therapy.

Subjects were 60 undergraduate students from a large southeastern university. One group of subjects heard a speaker deliver an informative speech with varied delivery. A second group of subjects heard the speaker deliver the same speech with unvaried delivery. After the speeches, subjects were administered tests of source credibility (as measured by nine semantic scales, developed by Berlo, Lemert, and Mertz), comprehension (as measured by a 20-item multiple-choice test), and emotional response (measured by scales developed by Mehrabian and Russell, and further tested by Biggers, Beebe and Masterson). The results support  previous research which suggested that varied delivery improves credibility and listener comprehension. More importantly, the results suggest that emotional response is a significant mechanism that connects perception of delivery to estimations of a speaker's character, expertise and dynamism. Comprehension of the message is not as dependent on either emotional response or credibility; thus comprehension seems to be a function of cognitive rather than emotional responses.

The taste for exotic locales and themes is an element that has been present since the beginnings of the American musical theater. Specific Latin influences came around the end of the nineteenth century with the advent of several historically important events that served to deepen the United States' ties to its southern neighbors: (1) the War with Mexico (1836) for the independence of Texas; (2) the Spanish-American War of 1898 when Americans fought in Cuba, receiving Puerto Rico as part of the peace treaty; and (3) the digging of  the Panama Canal which the United States took over from France in 1907. A host of films have portrayed Latin Americans with familiar stereotypes, such as the hissing villain, the gigolo, the &quot;Mexican Spitfire,&quot; and the &quot;lazy, shiftless Latin.&quot; Although non-musicals were made, the primary genre of films dealing with Latin American was romantic musicals that used popular Latin music.

        "description":"In the history of small group studies (in the field of communication theory and research), two factors contributed to the changes that led to Ernest Bormann publishing in 1970 his work questioning the value of the knowledge being reported and the appropriateness of the methods by which it was being generated. First, prior to 1965, a limited amount of the scholarship about groups produced in communication studies would qualify as research. Second, the few scholars actually doing research more often than not modeled their inquiries on work in social psychology and sociology. The year 1964 marked the beginning of a new emphasis on the characteristics of communicative exchanges. Research on communication in groups during the 1970s and 1980s has focused on several concerns that  include: (1) decision making; (2) reactions to deviant behavior; (3) reticence and communication apprehension; (4) consciousness-raising; (5) risk-taking/choice shift/polarization; (6) personality characteristics of group members; (7) communicative characteristics of different types of group participants; (8) creative problem solving; and (9) gender/communication relationships. In the area of decision making, despite the limitations of research on communication in groups, impressive progress has been made in the last 25 years. Inquiry has moved out of a more or less exploratory, unfocused mode and now exhibits a theoretically grounded orientation, with communication as the central concern. Premonitions are for a bright rather than dismal future. (One hundred and ten references are  appended.) (MS)",

Cluster analysis was used to classify objects or variables into groupings. Results demonstrated that the means are available to define and evaluate systematically the composition of segments for television news,  specifically that: (1) audiences can be sorted into discrete benefit-oriented segments; (2) benefit-based segments can be linked to specific product types or categories; and (3) certain demographic characteristics can be linked to the benefit segments.

Data, collected from &quot;Broadcasting Yearbook&quot; and by mail questionnaire, resulted in usable information from 146 stations. Results pointed to several tendencies: (1) pure all-news stations tend to be in larger markets which are more hospitable to efforts to program news  radio exclusively; (2) increased commitment to news tends to be associated with more ownership support; (3) most stations' market and operating characteristics predate particular formats; (4) the stations most committed to news (typically in larger markets) have larger news staffs and are served by more news sources; and (5) the larger market stations may require larger staffs just to man the &quot;news net&quot; that is necessary to stay in touch with a large area.

To isolate responses to the appeal used, as independent of the carry-over effect of product and brand information, each set of ads was also &quot;masked,&quot; (brand names, logos, etc. were covered over) creating four exposure conditions: unmasked/soft liquor; masked/soft liquor; unmasked/hard liquor; and  masked/hard liquor. After examining the ads, subjects completed a posttest questionnaire measuring attitudes toward the advertised product and perceptions of typical product users. Results revealed that hard liquor ads generated significantly more correct product identifications than did soft liquor ads, and that soft liquor ads were more likely to be mistaken for ads of non-alcoholic food or drink. Hard liquor ads were also assessed as promoting products that should be used by older individuals than the products promoted in the soft liquor ads. No significant differences emerged between soft and hard liquor ads with regard to the images of the typical user.

A preliminary study of 142 undergraduates in a mass communication class at a midwestern university used a five-page questionnaire to measure regular television viewing habits and estimates of criminal victimization. Findings showed that the simultaneous measurement of time spent viewing and violent acts per hour led to an unanticipated cultivation pattern. In the follow-up study, 102 subjects from a midwestern state were randomly selected for telephone interviews using a random digit dialing technique--50  subjects were drawn from a city known for its high crime rate, while another 51 subjects were drawn from a city with a much lower crime rate. Respondents reported the amount of time spent watching television, favorite television programs, and level of fear for each of several crimes listed by the interviewer. Results suggested mixed support for the cultivation reformulations known as mainstreaming (a convergence of views among those exposed to heavy amounts of television in various social subgroups) and resonance (situations in which salient aspects of real-world reality and television reality converge).

Subjects, 456 former subscribers from Dallas, Des Moines, Iowa, and South Bend, Indiana, were given a questionnaire and then divided into three groups according to their responses: (1) rejecters--those who decide not to adopt an innovation after an initial trial period; (2) replacers--those who replace one innovation with a better or superseding one; and (3) disenchanteds--those who discontinue an innovation due to dissatisfaction with some  aspect of it. Results indicated that the unsettled nature of the respondents may make it difficult to develop strategies to curtail disconnections. Findings also showed that the less likely the decision to subscribe is made by the head of the household the more likely that disconnection will follow; this suggests that cable operators should try to convince the head of the household that cable is a worthwhile addition to the household directing promotions less toward children and others and more toward the household head.

        "description":"A conceptual and theoretical framework is needed for the literature on newswork and to do this the relationship between skill and control which has been raised as an issue in the Marxist theory of industrial organization needs to be examined. A theoretical reinterpretation might help to understand how the notion of skill on the individual, technical, and subjective levels is related to the broader issues, such as the control of the labor process and the reproduction of social relations. The labor process perspective provides a theoretical connection between the microscopic level of individual workers, such as subjectivity and skill, and the more macroscopic level of social relations. Using a synthesis of Harry Braverman's notion of the labor process and concept of skill and  Michael Burowoy's notions of game and subjectivity is illuminating for several aspects of newswork, i.e.: (1) the social world which a newsworker encounters is not a transparently visible field of capital-labor antagonism, but an &quot;imaginary&quot; world where diverse ideological mechanisms, such as the ideology of &quot;making out,&quot; or doing a &quot;good job,&quot; matter; and (2) the labor process is reproduced through the operation of the job &quot;skill.&quot; The philosophical and ethical debates concerning media practices can be informed by this conceptualization of newswork and how it is done.

        "description":"To assess how an urban university can take advantage of its setting to design a master's program in corporate communication, a 1987 study of the master's program in corporate communication at Duquesne University of Pittsburgh was conducted. Data were obtained through a survey of 590 local communication professionals, of whom 270 responded (a return rate of 46%) plus a survey of nearly 60 current graduate students and alumni conducted the previous year. The (2) faculty utilization; (3) improvement of ethical and professional standards; and (4) student recruitment. For professional needs at the national level, results revealed that most organizations required public relations departments to manage internal and external communication, indicating the need for courses in  organizational and corporate communication skills. Locally, respondents reported that writing skills were the most important for the communication professional, in addition to communication skills. In the area of faculty utilization, results showed that the interdisciplinary design of Duquesne's program relied heavily on adjunct faculty (communication executives with local corporations and agencies). Although the university faculty was small, the adjunct faculty compensated by providing first-hand knowledge of the field and creating job networking possibilities. Concerning the improvement of ethical and professional standards, it was thought that the program should provide a flexible curriculum supported by individualized advising. Finally, the study indicated that despite minimal student  recruitment, the program attracted many students through word of mouth and information in the graduate catalogue.

        "description":"The issue of whether to &quot;standardize&quot; or &quot;specialize&quot; in international advertising campaigns is important because it may help determine whether each audience should be addressed separately or whether advertising agencies should attempt to address the collective global consumer. Print and television advertisements for American products appearing in the United States, West Germany, and Japan were examined to establish the extent to which standardized and specialized approaches are currently employed in international campaigns. A content analysis of American campaigns, as they appeared in West Germany and Japan, was utilized by investigating the factors influencing which approach was chosen. Findings show that (1) while individual elements were standardized in many of the  advertisements analyzed, the fully standardized approach was rarely adopted; (2) messages transferred between Western nations were more likely to be standardized than those between Western and Eastern nations; (3) standardization was significantly more common in television than in print; and (4) highly standardized campaigns also contained significantly fewer information cues.

        "description":"Focusing on situational and personality factors as predictors of two common types of sales behavior (the customer-oriented/marketing approach, and the adversarial/bottom-line approach), a study conducted a national survey of advertising sales people and media buyers in the summer and fall of 1987. A total of 3669 questionnaires were sent to salespeople and 2078 to advertising agencies, with an overall response rate of 20 percent. Personality constructs were measured with 83 items drawn from various adaptive selling scales and self-concept and self-esteem scales. Situational variables were measured with open-ended questions asking the salesperson to indicate the percent of business conducted in a direct selling situation (when the client is less knowledgeable about media, has less  access to media evaluation information, and is likely to view the product as an intangible) or in an agency selling situation (when the opposite is true). Sales behavior variables were measured with 73 9-point Likert scale items, reflecting either the marketing or adversarial approach. Results indicated that advertising salespeople overwhelmingly reported the use of marketing/customer-oriented behaviors in their sales interactions. Personality factors were highly significant predictors for both types of sales behavior. Situational factors were more predictive for use of the adversarial approach.

        "description":"Focusing on ABC, NBC, and CBS's evening news broadcasts from January 1984 through February 1986, a study examined network news coverage of environmental risk--defined as manmade chemical, biological, and physical agents that create risk in the indoor, outdoor, and occupational environments. Using the Vanderbilt University &quot;Television News Index and Abstracts&quot; as a database, 564 environmental news stories were studied for the extent of environmental risk coverage, the kinds of sources used, and the similarities and differences in coverage of major acute and chronic environmental risk stories. Environmental risk reporting was also compared to coverage of other risks. For this study, 12 environmental risk categories were created, consisting of three issue-oriented categories (Bhopal  gas leak, acid rain, Agent Orange), five topical categories (including hazardous waste and oil/gas releases), and four broader categories (including air and water pollution). Coverage was assessed in terms of the number of stories, the length of stories, the number of field reporters used in the coverage, and the number of film reports produced. Results revealed that networks appeared to be using the traditional journalistic determinants of news (timeliness, proximity, prominence, consequence, and human interest) plus the broadcast criterion of visual impact to determine the degree of risk-issue coverage. Little relationship was found between amount of coverage and public health risk. (Three tables of data are included, and lists of the 12 types of environmental risk stories and sources,  and 28 references are appended.) (MM)",

        "description":"Although the generation of creative appeals is the heart and soul of advertising, there has been little methodology developed for the classification and study of the appeals themselves. The paper recommends the use of an instrument which provides a technique that will enable the advertising researcher to develop descriptive studies of ad appeals. The technique involves compiling the existing appeals used in advertising (from ad copywriter's perspective and terminology) and categorizing them into a motivational framework (from the consumer or receiver's perspective), in order to develop a tool for their systematic study. The four categories developed in the paper (a conceptual expansion of John Maloney's marketing framework) are: rational/functional; sensory/aesthetic; social; and  ego-attitude support. The paper suggests that Maloney's framework, designed as a classification of consumer motivations, can be adapted to the study of creative appeals and that possible applications include (1) usage rates of appeals; (2) time series analysis of trends in appeals usage; and (3) the comparison of appeals usage between different media and between specific advertising vehicles. The framework's strength is that as new appeals become evident they can be added as specifics under Maloney's broad categories. (One table of data is included and 50 references are appended.) (MS)",

In November 1987, questionnaires were sent to the creative directors of the 196 member agencies of the Adcraft Club of Detroit (the largest advertising club in the nation). Sixty-four questionnaires were returned. Answers and comments from the directors surveyed tended to support the notion that women have either achieved parity with men or are moving toward that goal. The vast majority of respondents found no difference in the creativity level between men and women and no difference between men and women with regard to stimulation to creativity. While a majority of respondents said that women did not have greater opportunities to advance in the creative department compared to other  departments in an advertising agency, one-third believed women had better opportunities in the creative department. Also, creative directors from smaller agencies were more likely to see women as easier than men to stimulate toward creativity, compared to creative directors at larger agencies who saw little or no difference. General comments about women in advertising tended to be positive, with some suggesting that parity had already been achieved in a business that depends on results and others suggesting that women had made great strides toward equality in recent years.

Two hundred forty news stories with clear mentions of religious topics were selected from &quot;TV News Index and Abstracts&quot; and analyzed using a content analysis scheme. Each story was coded according to network, month, date, year, and day of week, and classified by focus and significance of information, topic, news angle, and type of information about religion. The total number of stories, the length of the available news space, and the total length of each religion news story were also determined. Findings revealed that religion news is a rather stable commodity, and the networks generally included at  least one religion story in half to two-thirds of all newscasts. Yet, true religion news--news focusing on religious beliefs and behavior and telling something meaningful about them--was aired much less frequently. Fewer than one-fifth of all stories focused on religion; the rest generally mentioned religion as a minor element in an essentially secular context. In addition, some religions were covered much more heavily than others. For example, networks sometimes devoted as much as two-fifths of their coverage to Catholics and Catholicism. Also, the networks provided more information about conflict and discrete events than about religion itself. Finally, there was little evidence of improved or changed coverage of religion in television news over time. (Ten references and eight tables of  data are included.) (ARH)",

Results showed that, before classroom training, males' self-perception of their competence in common public relations skills was significantly higher than that of females. After training, however, there was no longer a significant difference between male and female self-perceptions of competence.

Whether these assumptions are warranted has been the topic of numerous health information campaigns. In a study, the knowledge gained from these campaigns was applied to an examination of the ability of information--both mass media and interpersonal--to influence nonscientists' judgments of how great a risk AIDS poses to them, as well as its ability to induce changes in behaviors related to AIDS.  Subjects, 505 randomly selected University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate students, were interviewed to determine mass media use, risk judgments, and behavioral change with respect to AIDS. A total of 438 completed interviews successfully. Findings showed that respondents distinguish three aspects of risk judgment about AIDS: self-worry, situational worry, and risk estimation. Of the three aspects of risk judgment, self-worry was most consistently linked to AIDS risk reduction behaviors. Mass media exposure and attention, as well as interpersonal discussion, were found to be associated with risk reduction behaviors even after the application of multiple controls.

Critics of advertising in Southeast Asia argue that when multinational advertisers or their multinational advertising agencies move into this foreign setting, they bring a set of assumptions based on Western consumer culture, which may be inappropriate for developing Eastern nations. In addition to the concerns about the transfer of a consumer culture, consumer groups are concerned that advertisers are promoting products which are actually harmful to health, such as cigarette smoking. Government regulation is one solution to curb the possible deleterious effects of the consumer culture. For  example, the government of Indonesia banned television advertising in 1981, and India has developed a series of regulations to prohibit the &quot;sexploitation&quot; of women by advertisers. While the critics in Southeast Asia are right to be concerned about protecting their traditional cultures, it should be noted that advertising is part of a larger industrial model that is being actively pursued by local governments in an effort to develop economically--advertising has historically provided the fuel for industrial and economic growth.

        "description":"It is widely believed that television viewing has a negative impact on school achievement. This belief is supported by negative statistical associations sometimes found between school achievement and amount of television viewing; that is, heavy TV viewers tend to show poorer achievement than light viewers. One possible explanation of this association is that television viewing has a detrimental effect on cognitive development. This research review extensively examines this possibility. The research literature examined included work on: (1) the cognitive nature of children's television viewing, including viewing behavior, attention, comprehension, and arousal; (2) the effects of television viewing, including displaced activities, general knowledge, attentional processes, task  perseverance and impulsivity, creativity and imagination, and reading; (3) modifiers of these effects, particularly coviewing by parents, and critical viewing skills programs; and (4) the relationship of these effects to schooling. The review concluded that analysis provided little support for most of the common beliefs about the negative influence of television on children. However, the conclusion that television had no major effects was difficult to support, since the review also reported that little research has been conducted on several major issues, including the influence of entertainment television on children's academically relevant knowledge. Also, reported was that some of the existing research could be challenged on methodological grounds. In addition, the review offers a  research critique and suggestions for future research.

        "description":"The history of pirate radio--radio broadcasts offered by unlicensed broadcasters as alternatives to licensed, commercial radio programming--is difficult to trace, both in America and the United Kingdom (UK) since mention of pirate broadcasts of a less-then-thrilling nature are rarely found. Also, until 1927, the U.S. government did not formally regulate broadcasting and spectrum allocation. The best-documented examples of pirate radio come from England, where pirate radio thrives. The UK pirates, such as Radio Caroline and Radio Veronica, operate their stations for profit, broadcast virtually around the clock, and solicit advertising from large, coprorate sponsors. Moreover, the UK station owners are usually financially affiliated with music publishing firms or record companies.  In contrast to the UK pirates, U.S. pirate radio stations operate on shoestring budgets, broadcast irregularly, rarely attempt to turn a profit, do not solicit advertising, and keep a very low profile. The Federal Communications Commission has an attitude of &quot;selective enforcement,&quot; meaning that it acts on complaints and interference, but does not seek out pirate broadcasters. Although ostensibly pirate radio provides an alternative to commercial radio broadcasts, in reality pirate radio broadcasts do not offer a substantially alternative form of programming. They usually rely on the same popular music that is programmed on commercial radio, rarely programming music other than pop and rock and roll. (One table of data and 54 footnotes are appended.)

        "description":"Despite a lack of evidence that subliminal messages experimentally embedded in advertisements produce predictable effects, many people believe they know what &quot;subliminal advertising&quot; is and believe that it is used and that it works. A study investigated this belief. Subjects, 206 Fostoria, Ohio residents, were given two questionnaires that inquired about response to a test ad, response to an advertised product (Grand Marnier Liqueur), and belief about advertising's power in general. The questionnaires were identical except that Treatment 1 was titled &quot;Subliminal Advertising Survey&quot; and Treatment 2 was titled &quot;Advertising Survey,&quot; with corresponding differences in introductory explanatory paragraphs. Respondents for Treatment 1 indicated less willingness to purchase the advertised  brand than those for Treatment 2. Results suggest that consumers who are thinking about the possibility of &quot;subliminal&quot; messages in an ad may exhibit a lower intention to purchase the product advertised, which implies that the advertising industry may want to investigate this issue, and, possibly, be more vocal about the claimed nonuse of subliminal techniques in ads.

        "description":"Media in democratic societies are generally assumed to have a responsibility to provide a forum for the articulation of diverse ideas, including radical discourse. Research on media coverage of groups which challenge the status quo, however, shows the limitations of the media in the democratic exchange of ideas. To evaluate the coverage of one of these &quot;deviant&quot; groups, an analysis focused on news coverage of two recent anarchist marches in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. Articles and television coverage from local newspapers and television stations were analyzed to determine the rhetoric used to describe the marches, the sources of information cited by the media, and the ideological frames of reference used to structure elements of the story. Results showed that the media (1)  covered the anarchist marches in Minneapolis with a pro-establishment orientation; (2) tended to &quot;marginalize&quot; the group by focusing on the group's violence and appearance, as opposed to the issues being raised; and (3) framed the marchers as being in opposition to law enforcement instead of to government and big business. In addition, research on other newspapers shows that to gain exposure to a diversity of viewpoints on social protest, which includes thorough discussion of the issues being raised, it is necessary to go outside mainstream media accounts of social movements.

        "description":"Newton Minow, chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during John Kennedy's presidency, considered his plan for the organization of international television--one that gave a new priority to broadcasting without fundamentally altering the legal framework of regulation--as one of the major accomplishments of his tenure. Yet historians researching FCC policy during the 1960s have paid little attention to Minow's fascination with international broadcasting. Developments in global politics and the communications industry (such as the perceived threat of international Communist takeover, and the development of communications satellites) raised concerns about a policy gap in this area. Minow attempted to develop such policy by articulating a link between the public interest  and the national interest. Richard Neustadt's model of presidential power shows how Minow's efforts were closely tied to the Kennedy administration as part of a larger campaign to bring together disparate and often conflicting interests behind a coherent policy for international television. To influence public thinking and forge alliances among powerful societal groups, Minow focused on three major areas: the public at large; Democratic party circles; and the broadcasting industry. By providing this historical context for Minow's maneuvers, researchers can better understand how and why he succeeded in forming a plan for international television.

In November 1987, 2,031 questionnaires were sent to randomly selected members of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) and the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC); 650 questionnaires were culled from a larger number and were analyzed for the study. The questionnaire consisted of 47 items examining job satisfaction, alienation from work, public relations roles, James Grunig's four models of public relations, and  personal history. Analysis revealed that most respondents did not describe their educations as having been in public relations. However, a trend toward more specialized education in public relations was seen in the fact that of practitioners 29-years-old and under, one-fourth described themselves as having had concentrated education in public relations, and nearly three-fourths had at least one course specifically in it. Finally, the survey indicated few relationships between formal public relations education and certain key variables of professionalism (autonomy, models of public relations practice, and commitment).

It is axiomatic that a well-informed public is a better electorate. However, the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech has been stretched by journalists into the &quot;right to know,&quot; an elastic definition of newsworthiness creating a jungle of journalistic voyeurism, providing information that titillates rather than informs. The recent coverage of soap-opera elements of public figures' lives (such as Gary Hart) provides several cases in point. The American Mass Media Machine should re-orient itself toward an ethically-based journalism, one which includes in its  criteria of newsworthiness decency and fairness, &quot;redeeming social value,&quot; and maintaining the dignity of news subjects. Otherwise, its credibility will suffer. Moreover, information important to the electorate may go unreported or be lost in trivialities. Business (financial) decisions determine newsworthiness; sex and sleaze sell papers and garner ratings points. However, the public's needs should prevail over the ledger sheet--the Mass Media Machine should use discriminating taste and judgment in deciding what information to present and how to present it.

          "Albiani, Gil"],
        "description":"After years of struggling with increasing student enrollments, the Elk Grove Unified School District (Sacramento County, California) conducted two $70 million bond elections to supplement State funding for new schools, improve existing schools, and provide transportation and student support facilities. The 1986 election failed with 64.8 percent voter approval, whereas the 1987 election passed with 74.8 percent voter approval. This report describes how Elk Grove learned from the first election and revised its campaign to pass the second bond election by a three-to-one margin. After describing the district's growth problem and its $285 million needs (including 21 new schools by 1995), the report explains the use of partnership funding to provide maximum state funding for new  schools as a first priority, supplemental new school funding from the local bond issue where state funding was inadequate, and district funding for needs not covered by state monies. The Elk Grove tax plan levied a maximum tax rate of $3.82 per month for existing homes and $9.82 per month for new homes. (Attempting to finance all district needs solely with a local bond issue would have produced an excessive tax rate.) Before considering a bond issue, the district exhausted other approaches, such as increasing class size (to qualify for state aid); year-round scheduling; and using portables, busing, double sessions, and other options. Subsequent sections cover planning, organizing, and public relations aspects of a high-profile, successful campaign. Conclusions are also presented. The key  to success is community involvement.

        "description":"Although teachers are a prime target of state reform agendas, recent research suggests that teachers are also major sources of influence on career ladders, an expensive and controversial reform. Assessment of Utah career ladder reform indicates that a 1983 Utah Reform Committee proposal aimed at differentiating salaries, creating hierarchical positions, and generating ongoing professional growth activities has produced an egalitarian distribution of benefits, minimal staff differentiation, and support for familiar work patterns. Teachers were critical actors in this controversial process. This paper examines teachers' capacity to shape career ladder policy at the state and local level, the processes through which they exert influence, and the conditions enabling them to become  major determiners of reform efforts. The study gathered state-level data from official documents, newspaper files, printed materials, and 49 indepth interviews with legislative and executive staff, state education agency staff, interest group representatives, media reporters, and other observers. Local data were acquired from the career ladder plans districts submitted to the state board of education, a state office of education survey of teacher opinions, and other sources. Findings showed that despite having little impact on reform inputs, teachers were able to constrain state activism by operating through their associations and their social interactions in the workplace. By shifting decision-making focus to the local arena, they converted an unfriendly reform into one more commensurate  with their own views and values. Included are 99 references. (MLH)",

The first section summarizes opening addresses by Professor Sixten Marklund (University of Stockholm) and Mr. Erland Ringborg, director-general of Sweden's National Board of Education. Subsequent proceedings summarize discussions of the development strategy for primary-level innovation in Sweden, including (1)  regional measures and cooperation between the National Board of Education and the County Education Committees; (2) development at local school and municipal level; (3) evaluation of the junior school project; (4) innovation at the local level within a decentralised and centralised system; (5) partnership between preprimary school education and schools; and (6) language learning at primary school. The next section documents visits by the delegates to schools in the Stockholm area to discuss with teachers their participation in the primary school development program. The visits undertaken by six separate working groups are summarized, along with evaluation of findings. The final section summarizes recent developments in school-based innovation in Sweden, along with concluding remarks by Mr.  Bengt Goransson, minister for cultural affairs and comprehensive schools.

        "description":"School site management, a decentralized approach to decision-making and school governance, is intended to help parents and teachers share increased accountability for student learning and provide a broadened leadership base through teacher empowerment. This approach involves a shift of decision-making responsibility from the school district to individual schools. Change efforts are most successful when schools' idiosyncratic characteristics are considered and when teachers are involved in initiating, planning, and implementing change programs. This paper briefly analyzes differences between traditional centralized decision-making patterns and the school site model and discussess Minnesota Educational Effectiveness Program (MEEP) efforts to provide strategies for alternative  organizational instruction patterns leading to improved student learning. The paper also outlines factors influencing successful change efforts and describes a survey sent to 330 MEEP sites. Results indicate that when MEEP is used, local schools (1) set clearly defined goals; (2) establish a climate supporting these goals within the first two years; (3) establish a collaborative planning process; and (4) develop collegial relationships as a precursor to implementation. The paper concludes by recommending continued legislation and funding to support the MEEP program. (MLH)",

          "And Others"],
        "description":"While most instructional supervisors recognize the importance of mutual trust and collaboration in building effective interpersonal relations with teachers (involving high cooperation, mutually agreed upon goals, and demonstrated positive outcomes), supervisors' attempts to achieve these ends often prove frustrating. This paper examines factors promoting trust, barriers to trust, benefits and methods of building trust, and staff development activities to promote schoolwide trust. To empower teachers to view themselves as managers in charge of school productivity, supervisors need to demonstrate trust in teachers, acknowledge the importance of teachers' role, and show their willingness to build collegial relations with teachers based on equality and mutual regard. Trust is related  to several factors: the purpose of supervision and evaluation; confidentiality; handling of complaints; consistency, honesty, and sincerity; and collaboration and participation in the supervision process. Barriers to trust include teacher distrust and anxiety concerning evaluation, teachers' hesitancy to express problems and concerns, supervisors' managerial styles, and time constraints. A major benefit of trust-building is to assist teachers in self-evaluation and in addressing problems before they become major. Supervisors can also help teachers brainstorm solutions to problems. Successful organizations function by encouraging their members to collaborate on strategies for improving organizational effectiveness. Appended are 11 references and workshop materials, including suggested  readings, geared to building trust in teacher supervision and evaluation. (MLH)",

The next section addresses the challenge of reorganizing the school district by analyzing the long-term evolution of the school district, the structural elements of the present organization, pressures on the present organization, and goals and tools for reorganization. The main section, \"Education by Charter: Restructuring School Districts,\" sets forth a hypothetical scenario, \"Hometown Public Schools,\" to  illustrate the process of reorganizing a school district over the next 10 years. Ten \"Events\" are portrayed to dramatize this process. Of these, the fourth event is an extended explanation of the key concept, \"Education by Charter.\" The summary presents 12 goals of reorganization, discusses other strategies for reorganizing a school district, and touches on the costs and on the relationship of school district reorganization to other reforms.

        "description":"In 1983, Channahon School District 17 in Illinois was $1.3 million in debt. Real estate taxes constituted the school district's chief source of revenue, but because the state's oil industry kept its assessed valuations below the actual value of its property through the use of experts and lawyers, the school district was denied much of its income. Thus, the school district decided to take the oil company to court. The school district hired an expert in oil refineries as a consultant and lawyers who were experts in representing local organizations. Consultants were necessary because the procedures for assessing the value of property and for challenging assessed valuations are complicated. The school district won the case. The property tax appeal board assessed the value of the  property at $166 million, in opposition to the industry's assertion that the assessed valuation was $76 million. The subsequent increase in the amount paid by the oil company to the school district accounted for the school district's positive budget of $1.5 million in 1987. Four charts are included. (RG)",

This consumer guide is intended to help educators evaluate their own educational climate by providing reviews and descriptions of the major tests and surveys used to assess climate. Section 2 presents reasons for examining school climate, including its relationship to student achievement, differences in the ways students and teachers view their ambience, the need to analyze hidden messages, growing evidence that change is possible, and climate's usefulness in evaluating curricula. Section 3 differentiates between school and classroom climate, discusses various definitions, and describes four categories of instrument subscales (relationships, personal development,  system maintenance and change, and physical environment) based on Moos' psychosocial dimensions. Section 4 discusses ways to measure educational climate, focusing on shared perceptions obtained through paper and pencil surveys. Section 5 briefly mentions state-of-the-art research and discusses validity and usability issues involved with definitions, measurement, importance to student outcomes, and practicality. Because no simple guidelines exist, section 6 provides some standards of comparison when completing a profile of climate variables, and section 7 offers five steps on selecting educational climate measures. Included are 1 table, 38 references, and 4 appendices providing reviews of educational climate instruments, a summary table of instrument characteristics, a list of resources,  and a checklist for selecting educational climate measures.

Next are three research studies conducted at the elementary level that reveal the efficacy of cognitive instruction both in raising achievement levels and in closing the gap between high and low achievers. These studies focus, respectively, on metacognitive strategies of first- through third-grade teachers, writing instruction for second-graders, and mathematics instruction in  kindergarten. The final selection describes the development and implementation of a successful cognitive instruction program for kindergarten through third grade in an urban school district. (TE)",

A primary purpose of this phase was to identify the historical background, discover the purposes and intents of teacher evaluation policy visualized in the policy planning stage, and determine the educational leaders' perceptions of the degree of implementation of teacher evaluation policy. In addition, 30 teachers, 30 principals, and 30 superintendents were interviewed regarding their perceptions  of teacher evaluation policy implementation. The study also included a documents analysis of teacher evaluation policies and teacher evaluation instruments from the 30 jurisdictions included in the study.

        "description":"The report of the National Commission on Excellence in Educational Administration recommended that educational administration preparation programs be planned around five strands--including supervised practice consisting of short- and long-term internships directed by research faculty and practitioners who are clinical faculty members. This idea is not new. However, recent research suggests that without conceptual foundations for developing internship programs, internships may fail from lack of articulation and definition. This paper proposes an internship model anchored in adult learning and development theory and often termed &quot;androgogy.&quot; After reviewing the literature and discussing alternative instructional approaches for adults, the paper describes a theoretical framework  based on six andragogical assumptions: the need to know, the learner's self-concept, the role of the learner's experience, readiness to learn, a life-centered learning orientation, and internal motivation for learning. The paper briefly describes the traditional internship and proposes a new internship model designed to integrate the formal knowledge of administration preparation programs with field experiences through a developmental process encouraging learner involvement and reflection. This model is defined by three distinct levels of structured activity (reactive, interactive, and active), each increasing in degree of student participation. The model assumes that schools will become full partners in administrative preparation. Use of adult learning principles may enhance the  theory-research-practice relationship as coursework relevancy and applicability are related to practice. Included are 15 references. (MLH)",

Research activities included 50 weeks of observation and interviewing to assess the work of eight experienced child advocacy groups. The resulting qualitative data were used as a basis for making quantitative ratings of the extent of improvement brought about by specific advocacy projects. This summary highlights the study's most important conclusions and recommendations. Findings are reported in each of the following areas: (1) the nature of child advocacy, based on similarities and differences among advocacy groups; (2) the accuracy of advocates' claims about inequities experienced by various groups  of children at risk; (3) the effectiveness of child advocacy at the state and local level, and the circumstances in which it is effective; and (4) the role of advocacy at the federal level, and the effects of federal-level advocacy on the quality of services to children. Drawing on these findings, conclusions are drawn regarding the strengths, weaknesses, and needs of child advocacy. The overall conclusion of the report is that school-focused advocacy experienced considerable success in improving educational services during the 1970s and that these successes are relevant to the changed circumstances of the 1980s. Recommendations are drawn from the study for advocacy groups and policy makers, and a final essay addresses educational policy implications of the report. (TE)",

The first section of the report identifies and discusses the roots of the present fiscal crisis, including the development of an oil-based economy, the results of past steps to cut spending, the antitax petition campaigns, and emergency spending cuts in recent history. The second section compares North Dakota's tax base with the United States average. The following two  sections describe the condition of North Dakota's state general fund and its system for financing public schools with a combination of state and local funds. A set of guidelines are then presented for evaluating proposed tax changes, and the remainder of the report analyzes the major state taxes and their revenue potential.

For instance, composers put musical components together into a coherent whole; similarly, principals organize high schools by establishing class schedules, assigning roles to subordinates, and maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment. Second, composers select instruments, texts for music, and styles of music for certain genres; likewise, principals deal with curriculum and instruction, funds and facilities, school-community relations, and services to students and personnel. The role of high school principals can also be compared to that of conductors. For example, both roles involve efficiency in organizational affairs and problem analysis; both roles involve judgment and decisiveness;  both roles involve leadership and sensitivity; both roles involve stress and tolerance; and both roles necessitate efficient communication.

        "description":"This policy paper focuses on religious challenges to the public school curriculum, specifically those involving claims that public schools are prompting &quot;secular humanism&quot;--an allegedly antitheistic creed that places human reason above divine guidance. While some courts have recognized that &quot;secular humanism&quot; may be considered a &quot;religion&quot; for First Amendment purposes, the judiciary has repeatedly rejected charges that specific courses and materials unconstitutionally promote this &quot;creed&quot; in public schools. Nonetheless, there are mounting efforts to secure judicial and legislative prohibitions against the promotion of &quot;secular humanism&quot; in public education. Courts have been receptive to requests for curriculum exemptions and religious accommodations unless they impede students'  academic progress or the management of the school. The Supreme Court has also distinguished the permissible academic study of religion from unconstitutional religious indoctrination. Yet several recent studies have indicated that the historical role of religion in western civilization is given insufficient attention in the public school curriculum. Correcting such distortions might avert some of the claims that public schools are advancing &quot;secular humanism.&quot; These religious challenges raise two troublesome issues for educational policymakers: (1) balancing governmental interests and parental interests in educating children; and (2) guaranteeing religious neutrality, rather than advancement or hostility, in the public school curriculum.

The opening essay examines the historical development of liberalism as a key to understanding the relations between the state, civil society, and the economy, and the development of the mediating role of public bureaucracies. The essay is divided into three major parts. The first part describes the emergence of English liberalism and its associated ideas of representative democracy, as contrasted with continental notions of participatory democracy exemplified in Rousseau. The second part examines three contemporary analyses of the emerging dilemmas of the liberal, democratic state. The third section examines  Marxist class analysis and its effect on the understanding of relations between state, economy, and civil society. The analyses of Marx and Lenin are contrasted with that of Weber, and contemporary neo-Marxist analyses of crisis tendencies in the modern state are introduced. Four readings by separate authors follow: (1) \"Nervous Liberals,\" by Michael Walzer; (2) \"Bureaucracy and the State,\" by Erik O. Wright; (3)\"What Does a Crisis Mean Today?

Accordingly, it begins by defining the aims of the Frankfurt school and then goes on to discuss its history and background. This is followed by an indepth analysis of the Frankfurt school's analysis of the heritage of Enlightenment rationality and their critique of instrumental reason. The Frankfurt school's philosophical stance is then delineated in detail, including its notion of theory, its analysis of culture, and its analysis of depth psychology; on the basis of this discussion, the principal elements of a  critical theory of education is outlined.

The introductory essay in the volume is an argument for the democratization of education by establishing a case for changing schools: by discussing industrial democracy as a democratic ideal, by providing examples of reform in educational administration, and by proposing some possible avenues for action. Accordingly, the first major section of the paper focuses on the role of school members--administrators, teachers, students, and parents--in schools today. After introducing the concept of industrial democracy, the paper provides current examples of reform in educational administration in Yugoslavia, Sweden, the  United States, and the Australian Capital Territory.

T.L.O.&quot; Supreme Court decision that searching students does not violate the Constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures when there are reasonable grounds for suspicion. The &quot;Wallace v. Jaffree&quot; case, decided in the same year, implies that &quot;moment of silence&quot; policies do not violate the &quot;establishment&quot; clause of the Constitution so long as such policies support secular objectives and so long as other activities are specified if prayer is specified. In December 1985, questionnaires were sent to 139 administrators in central New York to assess their knowledge of these decisions and to identify their sources of legal information. Eighty-eight percent responded. In addition,  selected print media were analyzed to examine how accurately popular and professional media reported these decisions and their implications for practice. According to the questionnaire results, more than 25 percent of the respondents did not know that evidence of misbehavior is required before searching a student; 20 to 25 percent had difficulty in applying legal procedures to actual situations; 52 percent reported that they had little or no information about the constitutionality of moment of silence policies; 21 percent thought that all moment of silence policies were unconstitutional; 29 percent were uncertain concerning their constitutionality; and the main sources of information were professional newletters and journals. The analysis of the sources revealed that the sources were  generally both accurate and comprehensive, which suggests that the sources were not responsible for the administrators' misinformation.

        "description":"The earnings gap between male and female workers across all occupational groups has been well documented; full-time women workers earn, on average, approximately 65 percent of men's salaries. Although male/female salary disparity is largest across occupational groups, salary disparity within occupational groups still prevails. For example, the salaries of women professors are estimated at about 88 percent of male professors' salaries. A recent study of the educational administration professoriate indicated that women faculty earn, on average, about $10,000 less than their male colleagues. Even when controlling for rank, women faculty still earn about $5,000 less than men faculty. Although these data suggest possible gender bias in compensation, descriptive statistics do not  adequately verify wage and salary discrimination. This study explores the problem of a male/female salary differential for professors by discussing relevant factors that may explain this disparity and by applying a model for detecting compensation bias to a sample of educational administration professors' salaries. Aside from simple descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations, data were analyzed using two multiple regression techniques. Results indicate that a small but statistically significant proportion of the salary variance (beyond that of other compensable factors) is explained by gender. Varying market conditions, individual negotiating skills, and past experience may account for some salary disparities. Implications are briefly discussed. Included are several tables, 3  endnotes, and a bibliograpy of 31 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"The widespread use of testing to make critical individual decisions concerning education or employment opportunities, coupled with growing vigilance by the handicapped community, may mean increased legal scrutiny regarding this type of testing. The measurement community is also aware of difficult, perhaps unresolvable psychometric problems associated with testing handicapped persons. The past decade has seen new federal and state statutes designed to ensure handicapped persons' free and equal access to education, employment, and public services and to afford legal sanctions against inappropriate discrimination. This paper reviews legal issues concerning the testing of handicapped students and employees in schools and colleges. Part I summarizes the major specialized sources of  applicable statutory and administrative law, focusing on two federal laws: (1) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which provides a wide definition of handicap and includes numerous testing requirements in education and employment settings; and (2) the Education of the Handicapped Act (1970), which provides extensive testing requirements and procedural safeguards specific to elementary and secondary school students. Part II synthesizes relevant case law. The largest cluster of testing cases has focused on alleged racial discrimination in special education placements. Regarding minimum competency testing requirements for receiving a high school diploma, three relevant court decisions held that this practice is neither unconstitutional nor a violation of federal legislation.  Relatively few suits have progressed through the courts, and the proportion of successful plaintiffs has been relatively low. The only safe prediction is that similar lawsuits will be forthcoming.

Teacher evaluation programs that fulfill both formative and summative needs should include components such as consistent and just policies and procedures; evaluation criteria that agree with teacher effectiveness research; a method for setting performance standards; and administrator training for teacher evaluation. While poorly defined criteria result in failure, clearly defined evaluation criteria result in improved instruction. An alternative to problematic rating scale evaluation is the descriptor achievement system, which is founded on teachers' exhibition of clearly defined skills. The efficiency of this system  depends on the training of the observers. The elements of administrator training for teacher evaluation include knowledge of teacher effectiveness research, evaluation methods, data collection, and conference methods. School districts should monitor their teacher evaluation programs to assess where improvement is necessary, involve teachers in the program, and stick to the chief components of the program. The efficiency of teacher evaluation programs relies on the combined strength of its components. Fifteen references, five footnotes, two appendices, and a copy of the District Self-Assessment Checklist for Teacher Evaluation are included. (RG)",

          "And Others"],
        "description":"Schools have become separated from society and social issues through the practice of &quot;transition education.&quot; More specifically, by stressing the preparation of students for society, schools accept the present structure of society as a given and therefore neglect their responsibility to educate. Since schools play an educational role in society, the neglect of this role results in the separation of schools from society. Two attitudes toward curriculum that involve transition education are the vocational/neo-classical orientation and the liberal/progressive orientation. The vocational/neo-classical orientation regards education as a preparation for work and mirrors the current principles of society. The liberal/progressive orientation regards education as a preparation for life,  emphasizes individuality, and asserts that society can be improved through the preparation of students for participation in its reconstruction. An alternative to these orientations and their subsequent separateness is the socially-critical orientation. This orientation maintains that education must address society and social issues immediately, emphasizes social and critically speculative processes, and maintains that only collective action can execute social change. Strategies for converting schools to a socially critical orientation include involving the community, curriculum reflection and debate, inservice activities, school reviews, and monitoring progress. The first of two appendixes offers nine starting points or concepts for initiating the socially critical school, with annotated  lists of readings grouped under each concept. The second appendix contains hypothetical interviews with proponents of the three orientations. (RG)",

Data were drawn from relevant documents, interviews with 19 knowledgeable persons, and a survey of Ontario secondary school principals. A survey questionnaire about the factors and conditions that affect policy implementation was distributed to 259 secondary school principals from 53 randomly selected school boards throughout Ontario. Usable returns were received from 159 principals (60 percent). Results indicate that  principals' personal beliefs and professional experiences dominate the decision-making process and increase in importance in the later stages of the implementation process. The data on OSIS implementation indicates that the administrative aspects of OSIS were perceived by principals to have been fully implemented by 1986 but that the philosophical intent of the policy had yet to be implemented within courses and integrated into classroom activities. Included with the text are 7 figures and 19 tables. A total of 11 pages of references are attached to the 2 sections of the report. (MLF)",

        "description":"Poverty prevalent in rural areas is associated with unequal representation in gifted programs. Some impediments to equal access include cultural prejudice, family distrust of schools, the stigma of academic success, inappropriate identification practices, and poor funding for rural programs. Five rural states have adopted measures to promote proportional representation, by developing adequate funding for rural gifted programs and fair identification practices. To identify the brightest students in isolated rural schools, norm-referenced tests can be used with local standardization. Three approaches are proposed: (1) create a pool of referrals from students whose achievement test scores fall in the top 50% for that school, administer a group IQ test to the referrals, refer the top  quartile for individual IQ and achievement testing, rank students, and select top scorers until 3% of the school population has been identified; (2) create a pool of referrals from the top 25% of all scores on a group IQ test, administer an individual screening-level IQ test, rank the scores, and select the top scorers until 3% of the school population has been identified; (3) use an entire rural district to develop local norms and apply the norms to the test performance of referred children.

Curriculum offerings include inservice training for teachers/staff, high school academic courses, student enrichment programming, and tutorials. An evaluation by the Texas Education Agency showed that there was no significant difference between students' performance in a TI-IN classroom and a face-to-face classroom. Another evaluation project being designed by TI-IN will compare baseline data with subsequent data and  will analyze the motivations for use and the expectations accompanying use of this technology. TI-IN Network is involved in two projects targeted for special education high school students: (1) Project Help, which implemented system modifications to allow forms of response other than talkback, such as tactile pads, voice recognition machines, etc.; and (2) The Mathematics Magnet School of the Air, which instructs gifted and talented secondary students on higher order thinking skills.

As many of the students are off-campus in rural areas and are employed full-time in teaching positions, a heavy demand was created for non-traditional practicum experiences. Development of on-the-job practicum experiences ameliorated the situation, but in turn created a need for supervision that could not be met by existing faculty resources. A program was developed to train cooperating master teachers as practicum supervisors, capitalizing on their years of training and experience and their knowledge of administrative policies, available resources, and contact persons. To  increase their effectiveness, the cooperating teachers receive direct instruction in skills for observing lessons, providing feedback, and evaluating teaching performance, during an orientation session which includes discussions and simulations. A practicum handbook was written to summarize all requirements, procedures, and forms needed to document and evaluate practicum student competencies. Observation and evaluation forms include a practicum competency validation form, lesson observation form, weekly progress form, cooperating teacher time log, summary evaluation, and practicum evaluation. Several issues of concern are outlined. (JDD)",

In each course, competencies in specific skill areas are covered to enable the teacher to meet individual educational and related service needs. The program serves trainees in cohort groups at multiple sites in various geographic locations in West Virginia. The program permits delivery of coursework instruction and supervision of practicum experiences by field-based personnel in cooperation with university faculty.  Practicum experiences are conducted on-the-job in the trainees' own rural work settings. Recruitment efforts are aimed at locating individuals currently living in and committed to rural areas. The program attempts to address retention concerns by developing local support groups at each rural site.

        "description":"The Children's Language Institute Preschool Placement Test (CLIPPT) identifies children, aged 2.6 to 4 years, with mild to moderate language/learning deficits, to determine which children would benefit from a language intervention preschool program. The test is presented in three sections: (1) the Informational Manual which provides theoretical and statistical information on standardization, administration, scoring, and materials necessary to administer the test, and lists guidelines for successfully testing the young child and for keeping young children on task; (2) the Procedural Manual which is to be used with the Test Record Form during administration; and (3) the Test Record Form which is used to document single item responses, along with worksheets for score analysis and  interpretation. The CLIPPT evaluates language processing and production in the areas of pronouns, prepositions, color recognition, adjectives, personal data, semantics and expressive language, following directions, body parts vocabulary, morphology, story narration, pragmatics, numeration, irregular verbs, and two-step directions. Phase I provides a quick instrument to identify preschoolers with language impairment, regardless of degree. Phase II is administered to students who fail Phase I and is used to more clearly delineate those who are &quot;at risk&quot; for developing debilitating language/learning problems from those with more severe language impairments.

The current Early Childhood Special Education Approval for professional certification in Illinois is a set of four courses attached to either of two teaching certificates. The Illinois Division for Early Childhood of the Council for Exceptional Children, the Higher Education Commission on Early Childhood of the Illinois Association for the Education of Young Children, and the Illinois Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development cite factors which have brought about the need for more adequate and specific training: (1) new knowledge in early childhood special education, (2) a broader range of identified  handicapping conditions and a broader range of severity levels, and (3) the requirement that teachers work effectively with families and that they coordinate an array of interdisciplinary services. The organizations cited above recommend that the Early Childhood Special Education Approval requirements be expanded. They also recommend specialized approvals for developmental educators (serving the birth through 2 age levels) and early childhood special education teachers employed in public school systems (serving 3 through 6-year-old children). Recommended content requirements for these approvals involve both coursework and practica. (JDD)",

An experimental group of middle school social studies teachers participated in an inservice program on effective use of classroom time, consistency management, and interventions for low-achieving and mainstreamed students. Results of the first year's research indicated that teachers known to be effective at the macro level were also found to be  effective, high-impact teachers at the micro level. In the second year, the sample pool and research design were modified, and initial analyses of second year data support the first year findings. (JDD)",

The project developed programming to meet the future needs of a target population of 290 severely disabled youth (ages 18-21) in vocational, domestic, recreation/leisure, and community functioning. The project also provided education to 36 teachers, 13 paraprofessionals, and parents of 71 transition-age students. A summer pilot program provided training in transition skills to 10 transition-age students, six of whom were  provided on-the-job employment training. Job coaches provided on-the-job training, travel training, and follow-up support to an additional 61 students who were placed in competitive employment at the minimum wage. A support and advocacy program involving schools, agencies, employers, and parents was established. The project effected an increase in the number of students placed in employment after graduation/aging out, and an increase in the number of students who received follow-up support and intervention while on the job. (Twenty-eight data tables are included, and appendices provide a job coach training outline, job analysis, assessment and job/student match instruments, and a list of dissemination activities.)

Four related group sessions deal with alternative ways of accessing services/products,  relieving caregiver stress and providing respite, caregiver education and training and support groups, and how families are managing. A second set of plenary session presentations addresses the following topics: caregiving in Great Britain, consumer-directed preventive services, data on caregivers to the disabled elderly, and channeling as an intervention in which comprehensive case management allocates appropriate community services to the elderly while allowing them to remain in their own homes. Two final group sessions discuss private sector foundation and small business support for family caregiving, and public policies and family caregiving. A list of participants is appended. (JW)",

The project's goal was to demonstrate a comprehensive, coordinated interagency model of preventive intervention for birth to 3-year-old handicapped or at-risk infants and young children. Following an in-hospital screening process of infants delivered at Mid-Maine Medical Center, home visits were made to confirm or negate any suspected risks or handicaps. Identified infants and their families residing in the four-town project area were then referred to the project's interdisciplinary Service Assessment Team for development of a case plan and delivery of services. The report focuses on difficulties in the design and conduct of the project in relation to such issues as interagency collaboration  and communication, parental acceptance of project services, hospital screening, prenatal assessment, home visits, and the Service Assessment Team referral process. Among conclusions reached were that any philosophical issues involved in determining which discipline(s) should be involved in the home visit component of the assessment process should be resolved, and that the participating hospital must have full involvement in planning and must endorse the project fully, prior to its beginning.

Developed at Kansas State University, the model employs a multi-modal approach which combines a variety of long-distance teaching methods with traditional on-campus summer course work. The model incorporates the use of an interactive audio telecommunications network, independent study, and field experiences that allow students to apply their newly learned skills in the settings where they work. Each training cycle is conducted over a spring-summer-fall time span. During the spring semester, participants attend an on-campus conference, read selected materials, and participate in several teleconferences. The content of the teleconferences ranges from discussion of reading assignments  to guest speaker presentations or a networking of experts from locations anywhere in the country. Summer activities include traditional courses on campus and simulated lab experiences. During the fall semester, teachers apply new skills in the school districts where they are employed, with the assistance of a local collaborator who provides advice and feedback. Teleconferences link students with university resources for problem-solving. A final drive-in conference is held near the end of the semester. Evaluation methods include student self-assessment on a continuing basis through keeping logbooks. (Author/JW)",

The oral narratives of the subjects were analyzed according to three different narrative analysis systems: an analysis of cohesive markers, an analysis of story grammar development, and an analysis of the conceptual development of the story. Results were compared with syntactic analyses performed on the subjects' complete language samples (reflecting both conversational and narrative language production). Since the syntactic competencies  of the students did not predict ability to produce sophisticated narratives, it was concluded that although syntax is an important component of narratives, it is probably not a sufficient component in and of itself to ensure adequate narrative production. Results also suggested the need to teach expressive syntax use and the use of cohesive devices across sentences and not exclusively within sentence frameworks. Five overhead displays used in the presentation are included. (DB)",

        "description":"Children with language delays often manifest low rates of self-initiated expressive language, particularly in school settings. Children with mild to moderate language delays appear to develop this pattern as a means of coping with situations in which they believe they are unable to perform or may perform poorly. Interactive language training procedures are now being used to successfully increase syntactic complexity, develop morphology, and train transformational rules in language delayed or disordered children. The linguistic and nonlinguistic strategies used in interactive language training not only foster language acquisition, but are useful in increasing spontaneous language as well. Linguistic strategies entail use of repeats, imitation and modeling, indirect commands,  questions, paraphrases, sentence completion, and development of feedback skills while nonlinquistic strategies include violation of routine events, withholding objects or turns, and violation of object function. These techniques can be used effectively by both parents and educators who now share the responsibility of language intervention with speech clinicians. By increasing the child's rates of self-initiated speech, it becomes more probable that improvements in the content, use, and form of language will follow. (Author/VW)",

It is concluded that both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that early intervention increases the developmental/educational gains for the child resulting in (1) his needing few special education and other habilitative services later in life; (2) being retained in grade less often; and (3) in some cases being indistinguishable from nonhandicapped classmates years after intervention.  Long term cost effectiveness is also supported by the data.

In the study, three non-autistic but mildly handicapped subjects (ages 5.7 to 8.7 years) with good social skills were given explicit training in sharing with and praising one of three autistic subjects (ages 5.5 to 6.5 years) using modeling, practice with feedback, and training probe techniques. Results indicated that modeling plus direct prompting of  interactions between a peer-trainer and an autistic student was an effective strategy; that this training increased both the frequency and duration of interactions; that these increases generalized to a play group with untrained peers present; and that for two of the autistic students, peer-training resulted in increased interactions with untrained peers.

Single-subject studies and experimental-control group designs were used to compare the effects of tutoring and small group teaching formats in public and private school classrooms for autistic and other developmentally disabled children. Results indicated that non-handicapped tutors can increase academic skills and manage attending behaviors in autistic peers. Results also indicated that higher functioning autistic students can be trained as effective tutors of lower functioning peers. Other research showed that small group instructional formats were superior to one-to-one instruction in terms of  student performance across several curriculum areas. Small group instruction produced higher levels of teaching time, correct student responding, more teacher-to-student interactions and more student-to-student interaction than did one-to-one instruction. Furthermore, small group instruction maintained appropriate on task behavior and comparable levels of self-stimulation.

Testing adaptations are discussed in terms of disability verification procedures, consistency in policy, and maintenance of academic and technical standards. The section on facts about disability distinguishes between students with hidden and visible disabilities and between students disabled since birth and recently disabled. Examples are then given of appropriate alternative testing procedures for hearing impairment (use of interpreter); vision impairment (dictation of answers to a  proctor); mobility impairment (exam given in an accessible location); speech impairment (substitution of written for oral recitation exams); emotional impairment (individual test administration); learning disability (provision for alternate methods of recording answers). Also considered are the test environment, exam proctors and administrators, timing of tests, and laboratory performance and vocational-technical course mastery. Resources at the college level include the designated office for special services and the Association on Handicapped Student Service Programs in Postsecondary Education, and the HEATH (Higher Education and the Handicapped) Resource Center.

The handicap of learning disability is described and a brief checklist of typical characteristics of the learning disabled adult is provided. A discussion of options after high school precedes information on types of programs for LD students including the prep program, the LD program in college or university, or the regular campus program. The necessity of verification of LD to qualify the student for various adaptations and accommodations is noted. Information helpful for locating the appropriate school includes a list of directories (with annotations, availability, and cost data); suggested questions to ask on visiting the campus; the importance of planning ahead  to utilize various accommodations; and social concerns. Also briefly discussed are high school equivalency testing for students with special needs, college testing services for students with special needs, and sources of recorded texts. Finally, six organizations or self-help groups and 15 additional print resources are described with addresses and pricing information. (DB)",

Lifetime exposure to and current use of substances with abuse potential were substantially greater in this sample compared to a like-age national sample. Exposure to and recent use of substances with abuse potential was considerably greater for persons who reported being intoxicated at injury.

An introductory article by Frank Rusch and others is titled: &quot;Supported Employment in Illinois: Economics, Industry and the Disabled Worker.&quot; The paper examines the job coach role, presents survey results showing qualifications desired by Illinois agencies in potential job coaches, compares these qualifications to those of job coaches actually hired, and provides information about average job coach salaries and turnover rate. Finally demographics and costs of implemented supported employment  programs are considered. Each of the case studies is presented in terms of the community, the agency, the supported employment program, the demographics of the job coach, the organization of the position, and the role of the job coach (including task analysis, direct training, recording data, and on-site job development). This is followed by a discussion of the perceptions of job coach duties by key stakeholders (program coordinators, employers, co-workers, agency employees, parents, and workers). Implications of the case study findings for direct training, stakeholder perceptions, organization of the position, and professionalization of the role are drawn. (DB)",

Microcomputers have given the hearing impaired access to telephone communication (the Telecommunications for the Deaf device), lip reading training, synthesized speech, and computer assisted instruction. Finally, computers can help the nonverbal physically handicapped student to communicate and peripherals (such as speech  synthesizers, talking scanners and keyboards, touch sensitive screens, keyboard emulators, keyboards, and adaptive switches) can provide access to off-the-shelf software. High costs and lack of information are still barriers to the widespread use of these computerized inventions.

Conclusions drawn from results of all three studies are as follows: consistent or characteristic patterns of performance on the K-ABC for LD children are lacking; the factor distinguishing students referred and subsequently identified as LD and those not identified as LD is usually a discrepancy between the Achievement (ACH) standard score and the Mental Processing Composite score on the K-ABC; global scores may camouflage  similarities or differences in actual subtest performance between groups of students; the K-ABC Achievement scale does not represent a unitary trait for students with learning problems; the majority of studies with LD students reveal mean simultaneous (SIM) processing scores greater than mean sequential (SEQ) scores; in contrast to the standardization sample, a large proportion of students with learning problems exhibited equal simultaneous and sequential processing scores; when a processing preference was shown by LD students, the SIM-SEQ pattern was most likely; LD students exhibit a similar pattern of subtest scores as learning problem students but with lower achievement levels.

Neither the college's business department nor the local multinational corporations took international business very seriously, and the new endeavor was received with condescension. Increasing global competition gradually made the concept of an international business major more attractive within the college and within the state, making possible the addition of a master's program in international business. While the program has been successful, its language segment is still not viewed as an integral or necessary part of the program by some employers and faculty. Even traditional language faculty do not  always accept business language instruction as important, and this remains the most difficult barrier to overcome. Business language faculty must show professionalism, commitment, and productivity in both teaching and research, and support their colleagues in both traditional literature instruction and in business language in order to establish the legitimacy of the field.

The project director focuses on the project concept, and the grants office addresses the institution's needs in administering it. The funding mechanism for interdisciplinary programs is similar to that of other programs, and the process includes developing the program plan, identifying funding sources, and writing the proposal. Each of these stages has problems and issues to be considered. Developing the plan includes the roles and commitments of participating departments or disciplines. Identifying funding sources includes tapping multiple sources for possible funding, looking for both formal and informal funding  sources, and determining who should do the funding search. Writing the proposal includes good coordination of the proposal input and construction of the final product. There are techniques for developing projects and writing proposals to increase their likelihood of success. Competitive proposals demonstrate institutional commitment, strong program staff, long-range planning, good organization, good writing, a conservative and detailed budget, good cost-activity relationships, adherence to the guidelines for submission, strong justification of need, and strong likelihood of success.

Previously, a translation service had been developed by the colleges' foreign language department to serve a local international trade center, and it was from that effort that interest in a commercial Spanish course emerged. A survey of business and language majors identified a substantial target audience and helped to pinpoint special considerations in course development, such as the lack of business training of most language majors and the limited time in business majors' schedules. A review of  available materials revealed appropriate materials but no single text, so the course developers wrote 10 units with supplemental cultural readings and practical exercises. During the second time the course was taught, guest speakers from the business community were invited to the class. The success of the effort has convinced the language faculty of the value of a school-business collaboration. (MSE)",

Available sources for developing cultural information for classroom use include print and videotaped materials that are either specific to a country or relate to management and public policy. Recurring themes in literature concerning French corporate culture include the role of the state in business, consideration of what a French analyst expects to find when looking at a company, and  proposals for improving companies' situations. The management of information is another area of considerable difference between France and the United States, and is examined in various ways in the literature.

        "description":"The description of an international business major in a small liberal arts college outlines the program's development and the degree requirements as they have changed since its inception in 1977. In this process, foreign languages have become an integral part of the program design, reinforcing its value in the minds of faculty advisers as well as students. An advanced composition and conversation course focusing entirely on business has resulted. This course places considerable emphasis on vocabulary building, the function and composition of business documents, and the potential role of the foreign language skills after graduation. The program's major advantages include its flexibility, use of college-wide resources, the cooperative spirit developed between the departments, joint  student advising, the high caliber of students participating, increased number of foreign language courses as well as courses in international and comparative economics, shared faculty and student interests in extracurricular activities, and increased job opportunities for the program's participants.

The process is described as having three stages: assessment of the department's curricular mission in light of the changed student constituency; development of a long-range plan for outreach and public relations activities to prepare the way for complete revision of foreign language course offerings; and the drafting and implementation of a new program. Events and conditions leading up to the departmental crisis and program reorganization, the gathering of administrative support, the planning process, and the lessons learned from it are chronicled, and the integration of liberal arts principles into the program curriculum is described. The success of the effort is seen in  the department's deliberate marshalling of support among colleagues in the expanding business and social sciences departments and in the productive alliances that have emerged from it.

The foreign language teaching syllabus involves both the integration of subject matter (what to talk about) and linguistic matter (how to talk about it). Choices of syllabi can range from the purely linguistic (the teaching of grammar and vocabulary) to the semantic or information type (the teaching of a particular skill). To design a syllabus is to decide what gets taught and in what order; therefore, the choice of a syllabus is a major decision and should be made with as much information as possible. Although six distinct types of language teaching syllabi exist, they are not mutually exclusive, for almost  all syllabi are combinations of two or more of the following types: (1) a structural formal syllabus (teaching of grammar); (2) a notional/functional syllabus (teaching of functions that are performed when language is used or the notions that language is used to express); (3) a situational syllabus (teaching language in a context of real or imaginary situations in which language is used); (4) a skill-based syllabus (teaching specific language skills-listening, reading, and so on); (5) a task-based syllabus (teaching a variety of language forms, functions, and skills so students may complete a piece of work); and (6) a content-based syllabus (teaching course content, like science, using the language that the students are also learning). Ten steps in preparing a practical language teaching  syllabus are included. (TR)",

Specifically, the preference for &quot;a&quot; over &quot;my&quot; is found to increase with (1) the number of that specific body part (legs, teeth, etc.) that one is believed to possess, (2) prior mention of the agent, and (3) salient shared knowledge of  possession (e.g., a visible cast or bandage).

The four aspects are the teacher's role, the student's role, classroom materials, and student evaluation. The teacher's role changed from that of director and controller of learning to catalyst and monitor. The student's role changed from that of passive recipient of learning to an active determiner of personal language development, involved in most classroom decision-making. The learning materials used in class were generally what students produced and brought to class, including journal entries, discussion topics, special projects, skits,  reading materials, and videotapes. Students were evaluated on a point system based solely on the quantity, rather than quality, of their interaction with the target language, allowing them to interact freely in the four language skills. Of 231 students in the group studied, only three did not receive passing grades, a substantial reduction in percentage. Students produced large volumes of written material in English and read large quantities of English text, and reported or recorded special efforts to practice oral communicative skills. (MSE)",

Data on the performance of language-minority and language-majority students, gathered from norm-referenced tests and student interviews over three years, are displayed in 11 tables and analyzed in the text. In general, the findings support the use of the two-way bilingual program design for its emphasis on language learning as a resource rather than as a problem. Some less positive results in English language and mathematics development among native speakers are attributed to the complexity of implementing two curricula in one class.  It is suggested that two-way bilingual programs, if properly monitored and supported, can recontextualize current second language education practices. (MSE)",

The t-unit completely eliminates full-clause coordination from any quantitative description of syntactic development, while sentence analysis allows such knowledge to be represented. In addition, the coordination index in sentence analysis allows comparison of the shift from the use  of coordination by beginning learners to the use of embedding by more advanced learners, and finally, the use of the sentence, a learner-centered unit, gives both teachers and researchers access to data in the same form. It is suggested that whether used to measure average sentence length, average length of error-free sentences, or clauses per sentence, sentence-based analyses are useful in the analysis of written second language discourse.

Students were required to write a dialogue journal entry for each class meeting and encouraged to write about their experiences with English writing and their responses to content presented in class.

The teacher wrote a brief text in the first person on a topic of interest to immigrants--homesickness--to be read aloud in class and discussed. The students were then asked to write about three living places and situations, one in the past, one in the present, and one in the future. Student responses were often animated and contained surprising vocabulary items. Other narratives based on the same principles were developed for more advanced classes. The technique was also found to be useful for group  composition, in which the students draft a story as a group, allowing the weaker students to actively participate in the discussion. The short story format, group interaction, and open-ended narrative style make the writing process both beneficial and challenging to students still struggling with the language. (MSE)",

Students write plays as a group about specific situations with specific personalities and perspectives. The group playwriting allows for ample discussion of both grammatical and cultural issues. Students then study and perform the play for videotaping, with subsequent self-analysis. Readings, class discussions, guest speakers, and other techniques are used to focus on the specific issue addressed.

An adult native English-speaker addressed four people in turn--an adult native English-speaker, an adult non-native English-speaker, a 3-year-old native speaker, and the child's mother--by giving them instructions on how to build a particular structure of colored toy blocks. The dialogues were recorded and analyzed for rate of speech, non-fluencies, reference, redundancy and paraphrases, and number of interaction elements. Additional aspects examined were the impact of rehearsal on the addressor, the implications of addressing each of the  addresses, simplification strategies used with the child, spatial orientation, and other observations such as use of names, interjections, and confirming responses. It is concluded that variation in speech according to the addressee's linguistic competence and/or age probably does occur and that the results support the existence of reduced registers such as foreigner or mother talk, although fewer features of foreigner talk than mother talk were observed here.

The standards of what is readable and judgments as to what is understandable should always be relative to a particular instructional setting. Using traditional methods to measure readability is undesirable for foreign language reading because of students' insufficient linguistic and cultural background information.

The assigned tasks varied in topic control, audience, and purpose. Qualities of the writing were examined using measures of quantity, complexity, topic focus, and cohesion. Results show that the quantity and maturity of the dialogue journal writing was at least equivalent to that of the assigned writing on all measures, and in many cases showed more complex linguistic expression. The findings suggest that ESL students may explore and demonstrate a more complete range of their writing abilities in unassigned writing about personally chosen topics than in assigned writing about  teacher-selected topics. It is argued, therefore, that both kinds of writing are a necessary part of an ESL writing program. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The rationale and process for creating a credit-bearing intensive English program (IEP) at Utah State University, a land-grant institution with about 1,000 foreign students, are described. The program evolved from an intensive English language institute whose proficiency-granting process became tedious for staff and administrators. As a result, the proficiency exam previously used was abolished and the program was set up for monitored, gradual, and controlled student passage through intensive English courses and into the full-time university degree program. For budgetary reasons, the program was moved to the Language Department, where the courses began to receive 100 and 200 level undergraduate, elective credit for each of the five courses at all four levels. Arguments of the  administration against granting full credit were countered with support from foreign language, English, and other faculty. Curricula were written, and with the advent of a new dean, the program was separated from the Language Department and granted separate academic program status. Additional administration support and challenge has included the invitation for IEP faculty to become involved in research and moves to make the instructors regular faculty members. The program benefits by its credit-bearing status in a number of ways. (MSE)",

However, the advantages of learning even a little of the language far outweigh any inconvenience caused by extra study time. First, teachers abroad lead more comfortable lives when not depending on others for basic needs such as buying food or mailing letters. Second, they gain the respect of students and others because language-learning efforts communicate the value of language and culture and may help the teacher understand specific classroom problems such as pronunciation or discussion difficulties. Third, and perhaps most significant, is the effect that learning another language has on one's teaching philosophy, improving empathy and confidence by modeling second  language practice. (MSE)",

Traditionally, nonverbal aspects of communication have not been emphasized. Systematic study of this field is relatively recent in communication research. Both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication are important to the sociolinguistic approach to language teaching. The status of gestures has been widely misinterpreted; they do not stand alone but substitute for linguistic behavior. More focused attention should be given to developing communicative competence through gestures. There are two opposing views about how and to what extent gestures should be taught, one emphasizing interpretation of gestures and the  other stressing their active production. Lack of nonverbal expertise in another can lead to miscommunication despite substantial linguistic competence. Little information on the teaching of cross-cultural gestural comparisons is available, but the scattered suggestions in the literature concerning observation and use of instructional materials can be helpful in the classroom.

SUNY, Plattsburgh, designed an Academic Development Survey to examine student study patterns, faculty-student interaction, and value and attitude development. James Madison University attempts to link outcomes to environmental factors (e.g., the relationship between student leadership activities  and academic achievement). King's College has a number of assessment activities, including the American College Testing program, capstone assessments in the major, and alumni surveys. Clayton State College identified eight learning outcomes and established criteria for assessing them. At Kean College the initial value added orientation evolved to a concept of outcomes assessment.

Financial aid is studied in detail, by both source and type of aid. This first report of the 1987 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which is intended to give information to policymakers at all levels, provided data with potential for clarifying many policy and research issues related to postsecondary education and student financial aid. Statistics and details are provided on postsecondary enrollment, undergraduate education expenses, sources and types of financial aid to undergraduates, federal financial aid to undergraduates, the composition of student aid awards, and sources of  financial support to undergraduates. The data indicate that on an average, students enrolled full time for the entire 1986-1987 school year reported that it cost them about $6,000 (ranging from $2,100 to $12,000) to attend a postsecondary institution, and that 46% received some kind of financial aid. Findings indicate that financial aid is crucial for many undergraduates, and the relationship between the receipt of federal need-based aid and family income level is quite inverse.

Factors involved in state appropriated support are: (1) state tax capacity (the potential taxes per capita measured by the representative tax system developed by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations); (2) state tax effort (the percent of tax capacity actually collected); (3) the allocation/enrollment ratio (representing the state budget priority given to public higher education relative to the student  enrollment load); and (4) tuition revenues that augment appropriations to equal total support per student. The data for the included charts are presented in table 1. The charts are scatter diagrams for the states and the District of Columbia. The five charts present the following: state appropriations per full-time equivalent student versus tax capacity; the state positions for the relationship of tax effort, tax capacity, and the resulting product of collected revenues; the state positions for the ratio of budget allocation rate to student enrollment load versus tax revenues collected; state positions for the appropriation/tuition relationship; and the final level of total support per student for public institutions relative to initial state tax capacity.

        "description":"To examine the impact of foreign students on U.S. engineering education, a survey was conducted of departmental chairpersons and faculty of engineering schools. Of a survey population of 651 chairpersons, 441, or 67.7% responded; 1,757 faculty questionnaires were mailed, and 943, or 53.7%, responded. Results, overall assessments, and policy implications are discussed in detail, supported by data presented in 7 tables. In general, the study shows that without foreign graduate students, who constitute approximately 50% of Ph.D. candidates in engineering, research and teaching in engineering would be damaged. Little likelihood is seen of proportions shifting toward a majority representations of U.S. graduate students in the immediate future. However, differences in language and  research style and in restricted access to defense-related research can present problems for students and faculty. It was found that foreign graduate students are often more effective than U.S. students in theoretically sophisticated research, but the foreign students are less effective as teaching assistants because of language and cultural differences. Implications are discussed of the high enrollment of foreign graduate students for research affecting national security. (KM)",

        "description":"The way that the concept of culture has been used in the higher education literature to account for certain aspects of faculty life is examined. Culture is defined as the collective, mutually shaping patterns of norms, values, practices, beliefs, and assumptions that guide the behavior of individual faculty and groups and provide a frame of reference within which to interpret the meaning of events and actions on and off the campus. Attention is also directed to uses of the concept of subculture to describe faculty groups. Research on faculty subcultures has been influenced by two dominant views: (1) academics comprise a single homogenous profession, characterized more by similarities than differences; and (2) the academic profession is a complex of subprofessions or many  professions. Enclaves within subcultures, including disciplinary subspecialties, are considered, along with the question of whether women faculty, ethnic and racial minority faculty, and part-time faculty comprise subcultures. Finally, clans and occupational communities are discussed. It is concluded that the role of institutional and disciplinary culture in the socialization processes of faculty is essentially undocumented. Fifteen pages of references are provided. (SW)",

This manual describes, conceptually and through practical illustrations, each step of the ED QUEST process. In Part One, the essential elements of the process are described, including the criteria establishing information sources, identifying and analyzing critical trends and events, developing alternative scenarios, identifying strategic options, and selecting options to be incorporated into the strategic management process. Parts Two  and Three provide differing examples in the form of two fictitious institutions (a small, private, four-year college with a planning team inexperienced in strategic planning; and a public two-year college) to illustrate that a variety of techniques and versions of the techniques can be incorporated into the basic ED QUEST process. Part Four discusses ways in which a college or university could institutionalize an ongoing environmental scanning process to systematically provide information for use in the strategic management program. Topics in Part Four include development of the program structure and the scanning taxonomy, and electronic file organization; identifying literature sources and databases; training scanners and abstracters; and conducting scanning committee meetings. Provided  in appendices are a future prospects notebook, a round two Delphi questionnaire, scenarios developed at one of the fictitious community colleges used as an example, and biographical sketches.

Details are provided on the characteristics and destinations of the 48,483 students abroad. Reasons for the increase in study abroad include a desire among American youth in the 1970s and 1980s to understand a world and network of international relationships offering exciting opportunities and perils, the increasing strength of the American dollar against foreign currencies, and a softening of U.S. cultural attitudes toward foreign lands. Obstacles to such study include doubts about the academic rigor of such programs, suspicion about non-academic motives of program  promoters, and regret at loss of time spent on the home campus. The predominant direction of student mobility in the world today is from Third World countries to the host countries of the West. Important outflows from the western countries are also occurring, but data have been scarce about U.S. students overseas. This study provides statistics on world region (with the vast majority of study abroad students in Western Europe); leading countries (with the highest being the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Italy); field of study (led by liberal arts and foreign languages); duration of study (more than one-third staying for one semester); and gender (two-thirds female).

Additional background information is provided in descriptions of the pre-production planning; the on-location video production of the program itself; the President's appearance on the tour and his reaction to the unedited tapes; and the simultaneous telecast of the program by CBS and NBC--without commercial interruption--to about 46 million Americans on February 14, 1962. The rebroadcast of the program by some 14 foreign countries and  requests for permission to service a print of the show by 34 other countries are noted, as well as the reactions of the U.S. media critics, some of whom were less than enchanted with the First Lady's performance although the program was well received by the public. The critique concludes by placing the program in its historical perspective, commenting that, while the restored White House stands as an enduring legacy to the American people, the program which officially presented it to the public remains a monochrome memento of the New Frontier.

These include finding, manipulating, and scanning electronic text, as well as word processing, touch typing, and use of outline processors or idea organizers. The ability of software to transform information into new forms and the skills  required for collaborative writing, distribution of electronic text, utilization of specific programs, and programming are then considered. Issues for college administrators and faculty are also identified: (1) identification of essential information literacy skills; (2) teaching information-handling skills; (3) norms and ethics of shared or collaborative text; and (4) the cost of hardware, software, and training. The suggested research agenda that concludes this report calls for documentation of usage patterns, assessment of implementation, measurement of impact on academic products, and assessment of psychological and social consequences.

Subjects include: (1) the importance of calculation in research endeavors; (2) productivity in science and technology; (3) the philosophical differences between science and technology; (4) systems analysis and implementation, including effects of IT on the business aspects of research and researchers' behavior; and (5) computer support for engineering practice. A model is developed which helps identify the types of impacts that IT may have on the social system and epistemological aspects of research. Social system factors range from the behavior of individual researchers, through the organization of  research laboratories, to social policy concerning funding for research. Epistemological factors include choices of methodologies, kinds of problems to be studied, and evidence to be considered. Factors which may explain why IT has particular effects in a research endeavor are proposed; these include a field's data intensity, requirements for real time analysis, availability of calculation tools, applicability of results, reliance on established principles, clerical support, control over report production, and lay interest in the research. An agenda for research in this area is suggested. (11 references). (Author/MES)",

        "description":"The question of whether human thinking can come to simulate computer intelligence--i.e., AI in reverse--is addressed in this paper. Examples are given of three computer tools which perform several functions that constitute an intellectual partnership between student and tool. Such functions include: (1) assuming part of the intellectual burden in experimentation; (2) presenting learners with novel alternatives; (3) freeing the individual from lower level operations; (4) displaying intermediate processes; (5) providing intelligent tutelage; and (6) providing models of information representation, processes, and strategies. Conditions necessary for internalization of artificial intelligence functions are described, i.e., comprehensibility, generalizability, novelty, utility,  explicitness, and mindful abstraction. An experiment in which 74 Israeli seventh graders were divided into three groups and interacted with a version of the software incorporating metacognitive guidance and content-specific questions (experimental group), questions only, or neither is then reported. Results show that the experimental group devoted the most time to reading the texts and scored highest on a posttest; these findings support the hypothesis that interaction with a tool that models reading-related metacognition leads to improved reading of new texts in another non-computerized setting. Implications of these findings for a cognitive-developmental theory, a cultural-communicational theory, and educational theory and practice are examined. (28 references) (MES)",

Data collection included structured interviews with school district staff and principals; unstructured interviews with principals, school librarians, and teachers; naturalistic observations in regular classrooms and computer laboratories; numerous informal interviews and observations with the teacher designated as a key informant for each school; content analysis of historical documents; compilation of computer usage statistics; and use of a questionnaire to measure levels of concern felt by administrators and teachers toward  microcomputers. Several conflicting major themes emerged from the data: resistance to innovation; strong grassroots support for microcomputers; fear of microcomputers; high motivation to use microcomputers; the influence of early adopter school districts; and the importance of the individual in the implementation process. The data also revealed characteristics of the implementation process that contributed to and detracted from institutionalization of microcomputers by the district. It was concluded that, due to their technical nature, the potential of microcomputers to enhance the educational delivery system has not always been realized, and several factors facilitating and hindering implementation were identified.

        "description":"As part of an ongoing program of research to identify the difficulties encountered by novice programmers and to develop teaching strategies to help them overcome these obstacles, researchers employed a scaffolded interview procedure with 20 high school students enrolled in the second semester of a year-long BASIC course. Investigators presented each student with a sequence of eight programming problems, ranging from easy to difficult. They asked questions to track student thinking and intervened in student difficulties with graduated levels of assistance: first, general prompts to provoke strategic thinking; second, hints, leading questions, and bits of information; and third, exact solutions to the immediate dilemma. Results showed that student difficulties stem from knowledge  that is fragile in several ways, i.e., partial knowledge, inert knowledge, lack of a critical filter, misplaced knowledge, and conglomerated knowledge. Findings indicate that novice programming students might benefit from explicit teaching of strategies for controlled exploration as part of their instruction in beginning programming. Explicit teaching of strategic skills is a promising way to help students gain control of the programming process and appreciate the need for precision in understanding and using programming commands.

An overview briefly summarizes the presentations. Several conference themes grouped under the headings of Opportunities to Learn and Conditions for Learning are then discussed: (1) computers may provide teachers with opportunities to grow through pioneering and tinkering; (2) computers may prompt some teachers to become fresh learners of their own subjects; (3) the computer may provide teachers with the opportunity to learn about learning; (4) computers may prompt some teachers to revise their teaching style; (5) computers may prompt  teachers and others to engage in a critical examination of the regularities of schooling; (6) teachers must be partners in innovation; (7) teachers need time to learn; and (8) teachers need collegial advisors. It is concluded that teaching with new technologies can create powerful opportunities for teachers to become eager students, although this new learning is unlikely to lead to meaningful school change if it lacks a supportive organizational context.

        "description":"To learn more about the specific nature of the teaching and learning problems involved, researchers conducted a clinical study of 20 high school students enrolled a BASIC course. Investigators presented each student with a sequence of eight programming problems, ranging from easy to difficult. They asked questions to track student thinking and intervened in student difficulties with graduated levels of assistance. A coding system was used to record the type of difficulty students encountered, the amount of help needed, and the correctness of solutions. Experimenters noted whether errors were omissions of a necessary element, inappropriate migrations of an element from one command to another, errors in sequencing the elements, or other mistakes. Data analysis provided information  about loci of difficulty in three aspects of programming behavior: attitudes, knowledge base, and problem-solving strategies. Inadequacies in students' knowledge base about BASIC were revealed, with most errors occurring at the level of application. Findings suggest that programming instruction might place greater emphasis on encouraging students to prompt themselves with strategic questions about problematic situations, on helping them achieve more consolidated knowledge of the details of computer languages, and on addressing attitudinal and confidence factors in programming.

        "description":"This discussion of how technology can and should be incorporated into the design of instructional systems for the use of disabled learners emphasizes the importance of the instructional designer being aware of the characteristics of the target population, including the psychomotor, cognitive, and affective factors involved. A \"user-oriented instructional design process\" model first proposed by Burkman is presented together with suggested adaptations specific to design for the disabled learner. It is argued that, in general, instructional tools for the disabled must: (1) be adaptable and accessible to a range of student users; (2) facilitate and enable cognitive, affective, and psychomotor growth on the part of students; (3) be affordable in terms of financial and logistical  costs; and (4) be flexible enough to allow for continual refinement when subjected to formative and summative evaluations. It is concluded that the training and skills of the instructional designer provide a compatible match to those of the special education and therapeutic communities, and that these three groups together can provide a new level of cooperation in developing acceptable technological answers for use by the disabled learner.

The assumption that instructional technology is a value-neutral method of conveying instructional information is challenged by showing how instructional technology is value intensive in its support of a particular worldview, i.e., the scientific worldview. Heinich's definition of educational technology, with its emphasis on elements of replicability, reliability, communication, and control, is used as a framework to discuss: (1) the dichotomy between educational equity and educational excellence, i.e., provision of maximum access to educational  resources for everyone vs. increased access to educational resources for those who excel; (2) current challenges to the scientific worldview from groups who hold alternative worldviews about the production and justification of knowledge; and (3) the challenge to the scientific worldview presented by the &quot;new pragmatism,&quot; or &quot;social construction,&quot; as it creates a void allowing for the empowerment of alternative &quot;knowledge communities,&quot; e.g., religious and ethnic groups. The instructional design point of view, which embraces convergent and measurable responses pegged to carefully specified objectives in the transfer of a pre-selected, invariant body of knowledge, is called into question in light of the development of more fluid, multiple knowledge structures negotiated at the local level.

Finally, two faculty members were presented with the conclusions of the study for critique.

Both of the faculty members who critiqued the findings, and whose views about the place of technology in education were very different, characterized the existing situation in the schools as negative and the opposite of what they were proposing.

Subjects were 178 sixth grade students who were divided into three groups: (1) explicit training (ET) treatment group, in which subjects were taught to generate their own examples; (2) informed directions (ID) treatment group, in which students were merely directed to make up their own examples of the concepts taught; and (3) no training (NT) treatment group, in which students received no training in or information on strategy use. In addition to training for the first two groups,  all three groups took part in transfer sessions designed to test and compare the effects of transfer of the learning strategy training for the two experimental groups with performance by the NT groups. Posttests showed that while the ET group scores were slightly higher than the ID group scores in the training session, there was no statistically significant difference among treatment condition posttest scores. The ET group used the learning strategy in the training session, but showed a significant drop in strategy use during the transfer sessions. The use of learning strategy was minimal by the ID group and almost nonexistent for the NT group. In addition, ability was found to correlate significantly with performance, but no significant difference was found in strategy use between high  and low ability students.

This study achieved a 44% return rate, compared to Simonson's 34%. The survey showed a consensus for the following techniques and strategies for producing persuasive films: making the film \"fun\" to watch; assessing the target audience; using actors who are similar to the target audience; using written teacher's guides and follow up discussions; and using realism that is  relevant to the viewer. Comments from the film-makers provided some information about the low rate of return, as responses indicated an unwillingness to agree on a set of guidelines, given the complicated nature of the subject, and also a reluctance to reveal successful techniques because of the highly competitive nature of film-making. It is suggested that these comments indicate a need for further research on the art of persuasive film-making. (28 references) (EW)",

However, posttests indicated no significant differences in scores between the two groups, contrary to expectations that the  discrimination training group would perform better. The second study, which was an extension of the application of the rational set generator framework, investigated the effects of different types of wrong answer feedback on concept and rule learning. Four treatment groups completed programs with different levels of feedback following an incorrect answer--correct answer only, elaborated, forced repetition, and forced processing--and a fifth group completed a program without any feedback.

Piaget's early work in biology is explored and compared with his later work in cognitive structures. This later work is interrelated with the constructivist view, and this view is contrasted with empiricist and maturationist views of education. It is argued that a constructivist view of education requires learning to be child-centered, with the child  constructing the knowledge and the teacher serving as a creative mediator.

Self esteem, field articulation, locus of control, cognitive style preference, and need for achievement tests were administered and descriptive data were collected on grade point average (GPA) and educational major. A discriminant analysis of test scores indicated that those electing independent study had a high need for achievement and an internal locus of control, and preferred learning via active experimentation. There was no evidence that ability--as measured by GPA or intelligence variables--or descriptive factors--as measured by gender, major, or prior knowledge--played  roles in influencing the independent study decision.

One group of students generated its own feedback by using the expert system, and the other group received feedback from a teacher. The expert system used a question and answer approach which required students to relate textual information to what they already knew, and to evaluate each production project based on a set of criteria for that project. The evaluation task was subjected to two measurements: (1) a content analysis, which was used to count the number of standard criteria cited and the number of new  criteria applied or generated; and (2) opinion measurements, which included a self-rating of learning and a rating of the expert system. Nether the quality measurement nor the citation of details measurement (except for evaluation of lettering samples) produced significantly higher results for the group using internally generated feedback. However, the internally generated feedback group produced a significantly greater number of non-standard criteria in the second measurement of the evaluation task. Overall, the opinion measurements of the students who used the expert system to generate their own feedback about their project were favorable.

The data showed no significant difference in achievement for either the control or feedback variables. However, female students were found to be more computerphobic than males and less likely to have taken a computer course, but neither difference correlated with achievement scores; in fact, the female students achieved  significantly higher scores. It was also determined that students who had taken a computer course had more positive self-concepts than students who had not. In addition, female students were found to have a more concrete learning style, and they were less reflective in their style of learning.

However, this model and the language which it uses limit educational thinking. Emphasis on value-neutrality in the form of observation has led to domination of the field of education by an &quot;if-then&quot; mentality, a reduction of the cause-effect model borrowed from natural science. An alternative mode, based on Eisner's notion of educational connoisseurship and educational criticism, provides educational evaluation that is qualitative in nature, with the critic in education following the example of critics in literature, theater, film, music,  and other visual arts. The mode of discourse used in this alternative paradigm is non-discursive and metaphorical, and the critic draws upon his knowledge/conceptual/experimental base to describe, interpret, and evaluate what he experiences. The interplay of the descriptive, interpretive, and evaluative aspects provide multiple perspectives that serve to expand the dialogue of educators to alternative possibilities, and to help educators appreciate the complexities of the educational process.

Subjects were 132 undergraduate students who were divided into three groups: field dependent, neutral, and field independent. The task to be taught subliminally was the assembly in order of the pieces of a tangram (seven geometric figures which, when correctly assembled, form a square). Two versions of a videotape were produced for the study, one with subliminal messages and one without. Analysis of the data showed that neither the main effects nor the interaction between cognitive style and treatment were significant, and students in this study were not able to be taught a task subliminally no matter what  cognitive style. These findings are in accordance both with DeChenne's earlier and similar study, and with later studies in other areas. However, it is suggested that in this particular study, the task may have been too difficult and the amount of subliminal stimulus too small. In addition, consideration should be given to the effect of using a subliminal task that would be related to the content of the film presentation to support the subliminal stimulus. The text is supplemented by two tables and a figure depicting the slides used to produce the subliminal message on the videotape. (8 references) (EW)",

Three separate studies tested the effects of text density and presentation modes (print or computer), learner control, and screen density. Dependent variables for the first two studies--which were related--were differing types of learner achievement (knowledge, calculation, and transfer), lesson completion time, and learning efficiency. The study on screen density measured student preference. The data showed that low-density text was read faster and perceived as more sufficient than the same text presented in a print format. It was also found that when text density was used as a decision variable, learner control groups learned better than  groups receiving standard materials. The results indicated that the less skilled readers typically selected high-density text while the skilled reader selected low-density text. Thus, it is suggested that text density could be used as an adaptive strategy with appropriate changes in text density throughout the lesson. The text is supplemented by three figures.

        "description":"It is widely recognized that the American educational system has some important shortcomings. These shortcomings are the result of an educational system that is inadequate for today's information based society. This group-based, lock-stepped, graded, and time-oriented system has effectively destroyed the inherent desire of children to learn. In addition, the system is unable to adapt to the accelerated use of educational technology in the learning process. What is needed is a structural reform, but this reform must be made gradually and over a long period of time to permit sufficient time for planning, development, and improvement. In one suggested \"third-wave\" educational system, the teacher's role would change from one of disseminating knowledge to that of a guide who  motivates, advises and manages the child's learning. Parents would choose the guide for their child, based on information from, among other sources, independent \"consumer reports.\" Students and their teacher-guides would be grouped together in \"clusters,\" with instruction provided through free-standing learning laboratories. Student learning goals and activities would be established by contract each quarter to provide a balance between structure and flexibility. A district wide \"Consumer Aid\" agency would serve both as a place to match students with teacher-guides and a watchdog service to provide reports on teachers, clusters, and learning laboratories.

Subjects were 96 eighth grade students (56 females, 40 males) enrolled in careers and communications classes in an Oklahoma City area school. Students completed Part 1 of the Minnesota Computer Literacy and Awareness Assessment to determine their extant attitudes towards computers, and were assigned to four treatment groups to give balanced representation of sex and positive or negative attitudes toward computers. Four slide-tape presentations on computer utilization were prepared using one or two adolescent females to deliver the  introduction. Talents A and B appeared alone on each of two tapes, and were paired on the other two, each serving as the main focus on one of the tapes. The data showed no significant differences in credibility scores based on gender or attitudes toward computers. However, there was a consistent trend for students to assign higher credibility scores to individuals rather than paired talents, regardless of the subject's gender or attitude toward computers. The most frequently cited reason for perceiving talent as credible was the fact that the talent had been chosen to appear in the media presentation. When questioned about preferences for using computers alone or with a friend, female students more frequently gave a preference for working with a friend. However, preference for working  with a friend did not differ in males or females based on attitudes toward computers. (34 references) (EW)",

The subjects, who were 1980-85 graduates of the Wayne State University Instructional Technology programs, completed a mail survey that covered all of the variables for the study, and also included a self-assessment of 56 instructional technology competencies. The survey results did not show interactions between all of the variables tested, but do provide the basis for two models. The first model explains the links between learners' characteristics (demographic, situational, and occupational) and their reasons for program participation and on-the-job success, as defined by income levels. The nature of the  academic program or the level of competency attainment cannot be seen as predictors of job success in this model. The second model explains competency attainment in terms of the academic program, the frequency of use of various instructional technology skills on the job, and learner characteristics, primarily personality variables. Thus, in general, academic program participation and, ultimately, income level are linked to life experiences, while personality variables are associated with instructional technology competency attainment. However, both models support the need to consider instructional technology students in more dimensions than learning capacities and competence in the discipline.

Subjects were 48 undergraduate teacher education majors, who were assigned at random to six treatment groups in which a statistics lesson was presented in either of two modes (computer or print) crossed with one of three text density-level conditions (high, low, or learner control). Dependent variables were different types of learning achievement, lesson completion time, attitudes, and learning efficiency. Overall, the experimental findings were not supportive of computer based instruction relative to print as a delivery medium for the current statistics lesson. This  lesson's dependency on mostly narrative descriptions of rules and operations and allowance of self-pacing remained constant regardless of mode, but print offered the possible advantage of representing the text in a more readable and accessible form. Furthermore, the newness of the computer mode may have caused students to perceive it as more difficult or challenging. In the attitude survey, subjects were generally favorable to computer based instruction (CBI). In learner control selections, high density material was favored for CBI 75% of the time, as opposed to 25% for print. The overall impression is of a less confident and more conservative computer based instruction group, which generally worked as a disadvantage for achievement and learning efficiency.

It is suggested that the acquisition of conceptual knowledge and development and improvement of thinking strategies and creativity should account for about 70% of the learner's formal learning time, and that the remaining time should be allocated to the acquisition of information.

It is argued that in order to improve individualized instruction, learning must be related to predictions of what part of the environment individuals will process based on individual difference variables. Participants of the proposed study will be 200 undergraduates divided into two groups: one group will receive a selection of instructional text on a microcomputer containing key words used as center and side headings; the other group will receive the same selection of instructional text minus the center and side headings. Although findings are not presented,  based on the review of the literature, the following hypotheses have been developed: (1) there will be a significant difference between field dependent (FD) participants and field independent (FI) participants on scores of tests on instructional text with center and side headings and without center and side headings; (2) FI participants will score significantly higher than FD participants when the text does not contain center and side headings; and (3) FD participants will score at least as well as FI participants when the text does contain center and side headings.

Such virtues are based on moral principles and rules and moral reasoning. It is argued, however, that promotion of such virtuous behavior must go beyond merely publishing a code of ethics without any further explanation or application and interpretation in the training context. It is suggested that both moral principles and moral reasoning be studied further in the context of professional behavior, and explored in both the professional literature and training programs. In  addition, the code of ethics should be reexamined and clarified, and the dispositions or traits of virtuous professionals should be more carefully described, analyzed, and promulgated.

        "description":"Faced with the growing concern over educational effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity, many schools are turning to educational technology, especially the computer-based curriculum products known as integrated instructional systems. However, it is vitally important for educators to examine and gain a clearer understanding of technology's relationship to the learner over the longer term if they are to avoid moving towards a solution to the educational productivity problem that is socially undesirable. Educators must not only concern themselves with the systematic integration of materials and technologies into the curriculum, but they must also consider the systemic integration of materials and technologies into a balanced curriculum that will enable teachers to design,  select, and arrange for both formal and informal learning experiences adapted to the needs of individual learners. This &quot;opened out&quot; approach is of utmost importance as a means of engaging the learner's interest, effort, and day-to-day involvement in the curriculum, and educational practitioners need access to information that will help them become less dependent on the &quot;closed-in,&quot; prepackaged, computer-based systems now available. The EPIE (Educational Products Information Exchange) Institute is currently engaged in the development of a series of interrelatable databases--the Integrated Instructional Information Resource (IIIR)--which is designed to provide such information to both educators and parents.

Other issues of concern are the role of information in the economy, the value of information, the protection of intellectual property rights, and the determination of what future information professionals will need to know if they are to be able to meet the changing needs  of the emerging Information Society. Finally, the issues of lifelong learning as raised in recent reports in the nation's educational system need to be examined, and the role of libraries in developing information skills needed for lifelong learning needs to be addressed.

Although online searching in the school environment was not found to be broadly reported in the literature, the survey showed the topic was one of growing interest in schools across the country. Literature and survey findings are reported and compared in three major areas: (1) people: both students and library media specialists are doing online searching, media specialists receive their training in a variety of ways, and students are using online searching for class related topics and papers; (2) policies: there is little evidence in the literature on the  establishment of policies for online access, while the survey showed current school policies to vary widely; and (3) practice: the results of the survey confirm the findings of the literature regarding widespread use of microcomputers (especially Apple), and use of specific networks and databases. An annotated 21-item bibliography of recently published materials which describe programs and provide guidelines for implementing online searching in the schools is provided as a locator for educators, administrators, and school library media specialists. Copies of the survey instruments for media specialists and for vendors are appended, as well as a list of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of contact persons for the major vendors who work with school media specialists.

        "author":["Reitano, Joanne R."],
        "description":"The mission of the two-year college is complex, controversial, and frought with internal contradictions. From the start, the two-year college has existed outside the mainstream of higher education, deemed neither serious nor selective with a curriculum paralleling the high school rather than the four-year college. Efforts to enhance the position of the community college through curriculum reform will need to take into account key ways in which community colleges differ from four-year colleges. First, community colleges tend to enroll large percentages of low-income and minority college students. Second, community colleges tend to be urban institutions, with closer links to the surrounding community than most four-year institutions. Third, community colleges were designed as  commuter rather than residential colleges. And finally, the central mission of the community college has shifted from liberal education to career education. In light of these distinguishing characteristics, efforts at curriculum reform should use the liberal arts and sciences to: (1) examine the class, racial, ethnicity, general, and urban issues that will play pivotal roles in shaping students' futures; (2) enrich and enliven the mastery of basic skills while preparing students for college-level courses; (3) break down the perceived dichotomy between liberal arts and business curricula; and (4) enhance the academic quality of life for the commuting student and the community. Educators must insist on using the liberal arts to extend opportunities for social mobility and personal  development to students who need remediation, who want careers, and who dream of equality.

        "description":"This study investigated links between recalled attachment to parents and current parenting attitudes of 126 parents of elementary school children. Mean age of subjects was 36.3 years; average length of marriage was 13 years. The majority of subjects had not experienced disruption in early attachment relationships or parental marital disharmony. Epstein's (1983) Mother-Father-Peer Scale (MFP) was used to assess recalled attachment relationship between subjects and their parents. The MFP consisted of two subscales. One indicated the degree to which a subject's mother, father, and peers were reported to have been accepting versus rejecting. The other measured the degree to which the subject's mother and father were reported to have been overprotective versus supportive of  independence. Parental attitudes toward child rearing were assessed using two scales developed by Itkin (1952). The first measured parental attitudes toward children along an acceptance-rejection continuum. The second assessed parental attitudes about the control of children along a strict-permissive continuum. Outcomes of correlation analysis suggested that subjects were not making a significant distinction between memories of attachment by sex of parent. Only the variable of maternal encouragement of independence was found to be significantly related to a present attitude favoring strict control of children. (RH)",

The school contains only kindergarten classrooms (7 classrooms with approximately 210 children). Central School has implemented a &quot;Strategies in Early Childhood Education&quot; program, which is based on the premise that learning is developmental and sequential. Children's developmental levels are determined through a criterion referenced test, and from this test individual learning profiles and programs of study are developed. Children progress at their own pace. They are aided by high school and parent volunteers. The school has received very favorable evaluations. A grant to produce a  videotape of the Central School program was obtained through the Martha Holden Jennings Foundation. The project focused primarily on: (1) development of a slide and tape package describing Central School's kindergarten program; (2) development of demonstration materials; and (3) documentation, by means of formal and informal discussions, of teacher involvement with and response to the development of the other two components. A summary of a questionnaire assessing the project participation of the kindergarten teachers concludes the report. (SKC)",

Additional questions of concern included: (1) Was the settlement adequate and effective, given the nature of the risk to consumers? (2) How was the settlement arranged? (3) What role did the Justice Department play? (4) What facts changed in the course of a year to cause one Commissioner to change her mind and drop the refund  remedy? (5) How will the CPSC and the Justice Department monitor the preliminary and final consent decrees? (6) Does the CPSC have the budget to keep track of an exceptionally complicated arrangement? and (7) What details are being negotiated in the development of the final consent decree? Included in or appended to the report are an article exploring the effectiveness of information and education programs in promoting behavioral change, the report and recommendations of the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) ATV task force, the brief of 30 amici curiae states in the case of the United States versus American Honda Motor Co. et al., and the Justice Department complaint and the preliminary consent decree pertaining to the case.

Options fall into four general categories: financial assistance, time availability, direct care services, and provision of information. The principal options in the category of financial assistance are dependent care assistance plans and flexible benefits plans offering dependent care options. Employers may make additional time available or flexible for employees through parental leave policies, part-time work options, and alternative work schedules. The most familiar and visible of the child care options is the on-site or near-site child care center, but an increasingly popular option is corporate support of family day care homes or systems, in which four or five  children are cared for by a provider in the provider's home. Employers choosing to provide information on work- and family-related issues for employees can effectively raise morale and help to reduce the stress of holding two full-time jobs (as parent and employee) simultaneously. These information options include child care information services and work and family seminars. (RH)",

Subjects were 52 eighth grade students between 13 and 14 years of age who attended a junior high school in the metropolitan Atlanta area. Three paper and pencil instruments and a personal interview were administered. The written instruments were the Imaginary Audience Scale (Elkind and Bower, 1979), two subscales from the Personal Fable  Scale (Green et al., in press), and seven items from Form A of the How Is Your Logic Test (Grey and Hudson, 1984). Results supported neither Elkind's theory of the developmental basis of imaginary audience and personal fable nor Lapsley's theory of an interpersonal basis for these variables. In no case did cognitive developmental stage or interpersonal understanding contribute significantly to the strength of imaginary audience or personal fable. It was concluded that the major questions about the genesis of adolescent egocentrism remain unanswered. (RH)",

        "description":"The hypothesis was tested that humor facilitates social attraction. Students in three fourth-grade classrooms responded to two different peer rating surveys, one measuring interpersonal perceptions of humorousness and the other measuring classroom social distance. Differences between same- and cross-gender ratings were examined. Statistical interactions between the genders of the raters and of the children whom they rated were examined using a complex within and between subjects ANOVA design. Among both genders, children who were rated as more humorous were consistently perceived as more socially attractive. The findings confirm earlier research which indicates that children of the same gender rate each other as more socially acceptable and as more humorous than do children of  the opposite gender. A model fitting procedure was used to statistically confirm an a priori model in which social distance was predicted to be a function of interpersonal perceptions of humor and the genders of both the raters and the children whom they rated. Results are explained in terms of social facilitation theory. Implications for positively influencing classroom sociometric structures are discussed.

The introductory section briefly discusses the global epidemiology of malnutrition and offers guidelines for combatting malnutrition. Chapter I provides a framework for reflection on the establishment of a workshop for the production of a weaning food, and discusses the decision to produce such food at a semi-handicraft level as part of an effort to be a self-financing, independent component of economic development. Chapter II discusses the production of weaning foods at the Ouando Gardening and Nutrition Centre in the People's Republic of Benin. Particular attention is given to ingredients, functioning of the workshop,  distribution, promotion, economic aspects, nutritive values, and how families react to the product. Chapter III discusses the MISOLA weaning food experiment in Burkina Faso. The early period of production, evolution and assessment of production, and integration of MISOLA into nutrition education are discussed. Chapter IV describes the production of a porridge, Likuni Phala, in Malawi, a country that is, paradoxically, an agricultural exporter having difficulties meeting the nutritional needs of its citizens. Chapter V discusses the local production of weaning foods in Africa. (RH)",

        "description":"The role of social interaction in the literacy learning of 21 children 3 and 4 years of age was investigated over a period of 8 months. Data were collected at a preschool classroom writing center, using the ethnographic techniques of participant observation, field notes, collection of written texts, as well as audio and video tapes. Patterns in the data indicated that author/audience conversation occurring as children completed self-selected literacy activities encouraged them to (1) activate, confirm/disconfirm, and revise their existing hypotheses about literacy; (2) form new literacy knowledge; (3) become audiences for their own texts; (4) internalize the audience's perspective and use this information to plan texts for absent audiences; (5) experience literacy activities  beyond their independent abilities; and (6) with their teachers, build shared understandings about literacy. Overall, the findings indicated that children's self-selected literacy activities are rich contexts for literacy learning, and that social interaction, as part of these events, provides the predictable context and motivation for literacy learning, as well as influencing the kinds of literacy strategies children internalize and use independently. Appendices provide lists of transcription conventions and speech styles used in literacy events. (Author/RH)",

The sample included 139 facilities representing 139 directors, approximately 1,350 workers, and 7,900 children. Findings substantiated the plight of early childhood professionals in the area and further documented the national crisis in child care. Even though workers were found to be well educated, they received low wages and very  few benefits. Dissatisfaction over these issues led to high turnover rates. Concluding discussion recommends that: (1) governmental child care subsidy programs and payments for such services be greatly increased; (2) specific governmental policies with appropriate funding should be developed for the area of high quality early childhood education; and (3) employers should increase their involvement in child care for their employees.

Specifically, of 1,648 former participants, 93.6 percent were enrolled at the normal grade level. The performance of students was rated by teachers as mainly in line with that of nonparticipating peers across all three grades.

In the empirical mode, &quot;because&quot; introduces a description of a cause, whereas &quot;so&quot; introduces a description of an effect. In the intentional mode, &quot;because&quot; is used to introduce an agent's reason for acting, and &quot;so&quot; is used to introduce a description of an obtained result. Participating in experiment 1 were 16 subjects in each of three age groups: 5-year-olds, 8-year-olds, and 10-year-olds. Participants in experiment 2 were 24 children 5 years of age and 24 children 8 years of age. Comparison groups of adults also took part in both experiments. Subjects responded to sentence completion tasks and tasks  eliciting answers to why questions. Findings indicated that by the age of 5 years children have a good grasp of how &quot;because&quot; is used in the empirical and intentional modes, and also of how &quot;so&quot; is used in the intentional mode. Concluding discussion focuses on six possible explanations for conflict in previous findings concerning the ages at which children correctly produce causal connectives and succeed on comprehension experiments involving causal connectives. Each explanation is evaluated by assessing whether it could account for the discrepancy between the present findings and findings of previous studies of children's comprehension. (RH)",

Working in the public schools of either a small or large city, participating teachers were nominated by their principals as either outstanding or average in dealing with problem students. Problem students were categorized as: (1) failure prone; (2) perfectionist; (3) underachiever/alienated; (4) low achiever; (5) hostile-aggressive; (6) passive-aggressive; (7) defiant; (8) hyperactive; (9) distractible; (10) immature; (11) peer-rejected; and  (12) shy/withdrawn. In general, findings of the study indicated that the higher rated teachers expressed more willingness to become personally involved in working with problem students, more confidence in their ability to elicit significant improvement in the problem behavior, and a richer description of long-term prevention or solution strategies. Qualifications and elaborations of the general findings revealed the way general strategies interacted with situational and context factors. Additionally, differences were found between effective practices in early versus later grades and small versus large schools. (RH)",

A chart outlining the program's educational goals precedes a more detailed description of the proposed program, which is for grades kindergarten through 8. Discussion focuses on the current status and suggested goals by grade for English, social studies (history, geography, and civics), mathematics, science,  foreign language, fine arts, and physical education/health. Suggested reading lists (with emphasis on classics of children's literature) for grades K-3, 4-6, and 7-8 are provided in the English section. Included after the discussion of each subject area are profiles of curricular excellence from actual programs around the United States. (SKC)",

Follow-up studies of two evaluations of all-day kindergarten, a prospective study and a retrospective study, were undertaken to examine whether enrollment in all-day kindergarten (ADK) resulted in higher third-grade academic achievement than did enrollment in half-day (HDK) kindergarten. An additional study traced early grade enrollment and promotion patterns of two cohorts: those in kindergarten in the first year of city-wide ADK and those in kindergarten the year before ADK implementation. Findings disclosed no consistent meaningful differences in mean achievement of HDK and ADK children. Percentages of third-graders who were reading at or above grade level were lower  than they had been at the end of second grade. Additional findings suggested that a substantial proportion of third-graders had not been exposed to the antecedents upon which the curriculum was built, that early grade attrition may not be a statistically random event, and that children who remain in the system may be weaker academically than those who leave the system.

Maintaining and increasing this support, however, is critical for rural communities as they seek to strengthen their human capital base as a strategy for economic growth and development. The results of an education production model, estimated with an expenditure variable specified as a polynomial lag, suggest allocating resources to education increases output as teacher quality and quantity and increased funding have positive influence on educational outcomes. Standardized achievement test scores are used as school output measures. Teacher input measures include percent with masters degrees and pupil/teacher ratio. Per pupil  expenditure is used as a measure for supplies/facilities. Nonschool inputs are average daily school system attendance rate and parent-teacher organization participation rate. Percent of population 25 years or older with high school diploma and percent nonwhite are included as household or socioeconomic input measures. The high school student retention rate represents school quantity. Classifications of school districts (city, urban county, suburban county, and rural county) are included in the model using discrete measures to examine the effects of community structure on the education process.

Large-farm counties where agriculture dominates the economy are concentrated in the Plains, Midwest, and Mississippi Delta. Small-farm counties, with larger, more diversified economic bases, are concentrated in the Southeast. However, more than 50% of the nation's counties are unclassified, presenting local planners with special challenges in charting development either toward agriculture or to a more diversified economic base. Unclassified counties that tend to have small-farm characteristics are found mostly in New England and scattered parts of the Southeast and West.  Those tending to have large-farm characteristics are usually located adjacent to large-farm counties. This report identifies which counties are dominated by small- or large-farm agriculture as well as a large group, termed unclassified, which could go either way; provides models to differentiate county types; maps and describes developing subregions; and presents implications for rural America.

        "description":"Two areas--understanding what rural education is and what its real needs are--are critical in preparing educators, specifically language arts educators, for a rural setting. Although the problems facing these teachers are many, minimal preparation and training at the college level deal with the rural setting. Mainly due to funding, modern technology and resources are not generally available--and the rural language arts teacher must be more imaginative, have more initiative, and be able to work with people, for a class to be successful. Salary (often below the norm), location (frequently isolated), and role (the rural educator must often perform many functions) also have an effect. The rural educator may only have a few who want/need advanced courses, resulting in a narrow  curriculum and more pressure to individualize instruction for these students. Schools often stick with the traditional, and are wary of new teachers with different ideas. The following may be useful in meeting the needs of rural educators: establishing university contact persons interested in developing rural education; area consortiums of rural language arts teachers; advisory boards at the state, local, and federal levels; incentives, grants, and programs; technology sharing; computer networking; and working with rural organizations.

Witnesses suggested that to revitalize rural America, new jobs in  both traditional and new industries are needed. Others indicated that the rural economy no longer means isolated and sparsely populated farm communities, but a collection of many diverse economies, depending not only on traditional farming, fishing, timber, and mining industries, but also new industries like manufacturing, services, and tourism.

Training is vital because it secures cost reduction and maximum use of organization, enables people to face changes involved by new techniques and products, improves job performance and gives greater job satisfaction, and brings higher standards of workmanship by improving goods and services. Training needs exist at organizational, occupational, and individual levels. The main steps in developing a successful and effective training program are creation of interest in training activities, development of training process and  content of training, analysis, generalization or inferences, and practice or tryout or internalization of abstractions. A well-defined evaluation process is essential to continuously monitor the fulfillment of training objectives. Four levels in the evaluative process include evaluation of reaction to training, evaluation of learning resulting from training, evaluation of change in job behavior caused by training, and evaluation of tangible results of training and their comparison with objectives. Methods used to measure the learning effect of training programs include observation, role playing, case study, surveys, and examination/tests. (NEC)",

Existing data systems monitoring the farm sector either use the county as the primary observation unit, or they survey different individual farmers each year. A more useful strategy would have state experiment stations use primary data collection in a longitudinal design to survey farmers and the rural economy. Primary data collection is costly in terms of time and labor. However, the farm-level survey is a necessary tool for examining such issues as the debt situation among individual farmers, the role of nonfarm work in farmers' financial well-being, the adjustment of people leaving farming,  the effect on small beef producers of the loss of beef as a tax shelter, the relationship between land tenure and conservation practices, and the effects of changing farm structure on market structure. In addition, the high visibility of surveys at the farm level should generate funding from state and private sources. The paper includes 22 references. (SV)",

On the other hand, the size of the multiplicand has little or no effect on problem difficulty. The aim of the present study was to collect empirical data concerning this type-of-multiplier effect in combination with two additional task variables which have not yet been seriously addressed in previous research, namely: (1) the symmetrical/asymmetrical character of the problem structure; and (2) the mode of response (choice of operation versus free response mode). While the data of the present study provide additional evidence for the  type-of-multiplier effect hypothesis, they show at the same time that the two other task variables also strongly influence children's difficulties with multiplication problems.

The 18-part series is designed to improve students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills in mathematics. The purpose of the evaluation was to determine the instructional effectiveness and appeal of two rough-cut programs, \"Geometry and Measurement: Measuring Volume,\" and \"Problem Solving: Drawing and Interpreting Tables and Diagrams.\" The programs were shown to fifth- and sixth-grade students at nine schools in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, and New Mexico. In nearly all cases, evaluators obtained both student and teacher comments and scores from tests given before and after viewing. Reviewers found \"Measuring Volume\" to be both instructionally effective and  enjoyable to watch. Students had a hard time understanding certain parts of \"Drawing and Interpreting Tables and Diagrams.\" Teachers and students found the information too technical to grasp in such a short time.

        "description":"This paper describes some salient aspects of inservice education that focus on constructivist learning/conceptual change. Major issues for inservice education based on the constructivist approach are described. These issues arise from viewing teachers as constructivist learners, and from the assumption that constructivism and conceptual change need to be considered in the same way for both teachers and students. The following assumptions are contained in the constructivist theory of learning: (1) inservice education that matters involves conceptual change on the part of teachers; (2) when the thrust of the inservice program is towards constructivist perspectives on teaching and student learning, the change involves teachers' conceptions of learning and teaching; (3) conceptual  change in teachers is most helpfully considered in terms of whether or not new ideas are intelligible, plausible, fruitful, and feasible; (4) the conceptions held by teachers on entering an inservice program will sometimes include ideas and beliefs about the focus of the program which are in conflict with the ideas and beliefs of those running the program; (5) the inservice must, wherever possible, model but not mimic the strategies and ideas being advanced; (6) different groups will enter inservice programs with different levels of relevant knowledge and experience; and (7) those conducting the inservice program must be sensitive to their own needs to undergo conceptual change. Descriptions of four inservice programs illustrate how one or more of these issues arose and was dealt with in  the course of the program. (JD)",

The test was developed in response to state action for educational reform. The Texas reform legislation provided for redistribution of resources to poorer schools and for salary increases for teachers. Testing teachers on basic reading and writing skills for the purpose of identifying incompetent teachers appealed to public opinion, and the test become a political &quot;bargaining chip&quot; to leverage a tax increase for school reform. The implementation of TECAT involved not only massive preparation by educators and state agencies but also involved numerous validity and legal problems. The high passing rates of educators were  attributed to development of teachers' skills in workshop sessions and considerable &quot;teaching to the test.&quot; More than half of the educators fired by TECAT were in nonacademic positions. The reaction of teachers to the test program was overwhelmingly negative, and public confidence in teacher testing declined sharply. An analysis of the program's actual costs indicated that it was not as cost-effective as had been anticipated. This report presents detailed documentation on the program.

Action research was used a a way of working toward a student teaching experience that would provide opportunities and structures to facilitate and enhance the students' development as reflective teachers. Several different approaches were used in introducing action research to student teachers. To clarify their thinking, it was emphasized that the study was a means of obtaining and applying practical results to specific classroom situations. Students were also given some insight into data-gathering and observation as ways to develop their reflective teaching practices. In a discussion on how the student teachers were helped to reflect within  their action research, a description is given of the \"cosmic egg,\" a teaching tool developed to aid critical reflection by emphasizing the interrelatedness of all dimensions of an educational issue. The final section of this report considers issues that emerged from the experience of student teacher practice of action research.

Since student achievement is a key issue of policy research, the following methodologies for its study have been devised: (1) pre-test, post-test, gain score elements; (2) multivariate regression model; (3) canonical correlation; and (4) qualitative matrix paradigm. The first goal of the analysis will be to assess the magnitude and direction of gain scores for selected student  achievement measures within individual districts. Secondly, a predictive model will be developed within selected districts which will attempt to link multiple district-specific student achievement and teacher performance measures, while controlling for possible pre-existing extraneous influences on student performances.

Use of intervention instruction involving prerequisite data gathering skills with teachers has been successful in improving ability to use probing questions in classroom discussions, giving clear and concise directions, in solving formal operational level problems and involvement of students in decision making. The problem investigated in this study was to determine the effects of intervention instruction in cue attendance on teacher performance in analysis and modification procedures of classroom lesson plans. Included in the intervention instruction and followup lesson plan activities were detail  attendance, information search questions, hypothesis generation and designing strategies for hypothesis testing. The 189 participants in the research project, all final-year secondary education majors, were divided into three groups. Each group was given the same experiences except for the treatment variable. Pretesting involved critique of a classroom lesson for one group, a Piagetian Task Assessment for the second, and only introductory remarks for the third group.

In this ethnographic study of teachers' experiences with microcomputers in their classrooms, George Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory was used to develop a clinical interview strategy based on the idea that how teachers deal with a change is dependent on how they construe classroom life. It is posited that teachers have well established practices for conducting life in their classrooms which allow the business of the class to be done. Computer-based learning threatens those routines and causes routines to be re-appraised. How teachers use computers and how they construe their experience cannot be properly  understood without knowing the backdrop of everyday classroom routines and what they say about how a teacher interacts with the students in the context of the classroom. Using Kelly's method, two teachers were asked to construe classroom events involving computers and some insight was gained into the way they thought about their experiences with microcomputers. One teacher, at the elementary level, was just beginning to imagine how computers would work in the classroom. The other, at the secondary level, was already giving over some of the work of the curriculum to the computer. A report is presented of observations of the teachers' classrooms and of in-depth interviews with the teachers. (JD)",

Forty-eight teachers from southeastern Wisconsin and central Illinois, teaching in elementary through junior high classes, were in the intervention group. Forty-three elementary school teachers from the same regions were in the comparison group. Data indicate that teachers in the intervention group increased their tolerance for the range of cognitive abilities their idealized teachable pupils might exhibit as measured by the Teachable Pupil Survey (Kornblau,  1982). Using the peer collaboration process, teachers reconceptualized their understandings of classroom problems and were generally able to generate a wide variety of successful individual interventions to address identified learning and behavior problems.

Scales were used to study a \"low stakes\" state, where relatively minor consequences depended on student performance, and a \"high stakes\" state where graduation depended on passing the tests. The program had the greatest impact in the high stakes situation. For individual districts, a high stakes strategy had desirable consequences as long as the districts were not under too much pressure.  District variations were also a result of the perceived political climate between the district and state department.

        "description":"Seven schools that have re-evaluated their needs for standardized college admissions examinations were studied to explore their admissions and innovative testing policies. The schools include: (1) Bates College in Lewiston, Maine; (2) Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine; (3) Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in Cambridge, Massachusetts; (4) Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland; (5) Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge; (6) Middlebury College in Vermont; and (7) Union College in Schenectady, New York. Each school has moved away from reliance on standardized tests; the reaction in all has been overwhelmingly positive. Adjusting testing policies at these institutions was intended to reduce test panic and test preparation  time, lessen students' fears about their own achievements, and help eliminate cultural and gender biases. Schools in this study evaluated tests for their relevance and found alternatives to heavy reliance on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the Graduate Management Admissions Test, and the Medical Colleges Admissions Test.

        "description":"The topic of teaching troubleshooting is examined as an example of the teaching of cognitive strategies for technical problem solving. The traditional behavioral approach to teaching troubleshooting has essentially been algorithmic. Recent cognitive research suggests an approach founded first on task analysis and characterized by: (1) analysis of the symbol system used; (2) representation of the system under study; (3) identification of failure modes; (4) specific solution algorithms; and (5) derived heuristics which may be applied to guide linking of the detailed solution algorithms. Instructional strategies then would be developed for each of these areas. The teaching of troubleshooting for IBM's CICS application programming system is given as an example of the practical  application of these principles. Much remains to be confirmed about teaching troubleshooting. Research on the learning psychology side of the cognitive field has surpassed research on the instructional psychology side. An instructional psychology should be developed using cognitive psychology as a basis. (SLD)",

        "author":["Firestone, William A."],
        "description":"The current debate about quantitative and qualitative research methods focuses on whether there is a necessary connection between method-type and research paradigm that makes the different approaches incompatible. This paper argues that the connection is not so much logical as rhetorical. Quantitative methods express the assumptions of a positivist paradigm, which holds that behavior can be explained through objective facts. Design and instrumentation persuade by showing how bias and error are eliminated. Qualitative methods express the assumptions of a phenomenological paradigm, which presupposes that there are multiple realities that are socially defined. Rich description persuades by showing that the researcher was immersed in the setting and giving the reader enough detail to  make sense of the situation. While rhetorically different, the results of the two methodologies can be complementary. An analysis of two studies into the relationship of leadership on the part of school principals to organizational outcome indicates that there is an aesthetic connection between method types and paradigms, and it suggests some salient differences distinguishing qualitative and quantitative studies.

The performance of these two groups of subjects on the Pre-Professional Skills Test (PPST) and the National Teachers Examination (NTE) was compared. The program was implemented at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and Memphis State University. Upon being selected for the Lyndhurst Program, fellows participate in an intensive summer academic program followed by a year-long internship in a public school. Additional course work and seminars taken during the year complete the program. A teacher in the  intern's school and a faculty member from the college of education and a faculty member from the student's major content area act as mentors. In addition to the 18 Lyndhurst fellows, the 1986-87 study included 21 students from a more traditional program. Data were obtained from the subjects via the reading subtest of the PPST, the communication skills subtest of the NTE, grade point averages, and undergraduate major/certification information. Data analyzed via Mann-Whitney tests, stepwise multiple regression analyses, and Spearman correlation coefficients indicated few significant differences across groups. (TJH)",

The 50 professionals were the judges for a validation and cut-score study prior to implementing use of the NTE for initial certification in Arkansas. The teachers assessed each test item for its job-related relevance to determination of minimum teacher qualification and estimated the percent of minimally qualified candidates who would correctly answer the item. The teacher educators judged each item with respect to content coverage in the teacher education curriculum and made the same estimates as did teachers concerning the percent of minimally qualified  candidates who would correctly answer the item. Results indicate that: (1) 91 of the 105 items were considered valid; (2) mean percent estimates for teachers were larger than those for teacher educators on 87 of the 91 items; and (3) the difference between the cut-score for teacher educators and the combined groups was quite small.

The program strives to help students achieve academic success and become self-directed learners with enhanced racial pride and self-esteem. During 1986-87, the WYLC program provided tutoring to 175 students, most of whom were from minority families. Participation increased 92 percent during 1985-86. During 1986-87, the WYLC program added special activities to develop self-esteem in Afro-American youth, who represent 80 percent of the client population. A student survey was administered to WYLC participants, and student and teacher interviews were conducted. Findings of the evaluation of the WYLC program suggest  that: (1) consideration should be given to expansion of the program; (2) the WYLC should include strategies to enroll more compensatory education students and encourage participation of Chapter 1 students; (3) the WYLC should develop a plan for maintaining or increasing overall student participation; (4) the WYLC should consider the funding level of the program in approximating the number of students to be served by the program; and (5) future evaluations should provide longitudinal or other comparison data to relate improvement gains to participation in the program.

Six versions of an assessment report were prepared for a hypothetical child: four with increasing detail and information, one with an integrated description of the same information, and one giving another version of the complete report. Eighty teachers working with learning disabled children were asked to study one of the reports and answer a questionnaire on teaching decisions for reading, spelling, and arithmetic, and other pedagogical techniques. A one-way analysis of variance was performed on the data. Teachers presented with minimum information did not make as many decisions  as did those given a full diagnostic report, but different versions of the complete report did not cause a difference in the number of decisions made. Teachers make a number of decisions, but must follow a fairly fixed education offering. This may limit decision making because the need for information for a student is limited by the alternatives the teacher uses. (SLD)",

To find people meeting the criteria of Level 4 of the Dabrowski theory, a pool of 21 subjects was established by nomination. All subjects were given the Definition-Response Instrument to assess levels of emotional development. One man and three women were selected for study based on their levels of functioning. A life history was obtained from each subject. Interviews were the richest source of material. Three of the four subjects were found to be self-actualizing. They displayed a commonality possessed by self-actualizers, kindness and simplicity in responding to problems basic to humanity. It was possible to assess the degree of self-actualization with the  interviews techniques developed. The interview guide, life history questions, and definitions of the dynamisms of self-actualization are included in appendices. (SLD)",

Self-studies had been completed by pilot schools in the 1981-82 school year. Personnel from 11 schools with a previous self-study and 123 participants with no previous experience answered questionnaires about the instrument and were compared using t-tests for their opinions of: (1) adaptability; (2) clarity; (3) effectiveness in determining the degree of articulation; (4) grammatical structure; and (5) terminology. No significant differences existed between experienced and inexperienced participants' ratings. Both novice and experienced participants also considered that a kindergarten through  grade 12 stelf-study was more beneficial than a specific level study. Previous experience did not apparently improve the school's ability to cope with the process, although those with previous experience did begin making curricular changes more rapidly.

The data base includes student scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) as well as student reported information from the Student Descriptive Questionnaire, which elicited information on students' family background, high school experiences, personal characteristics, and educational aspirations. The model for the study was estimated for 314 women who indicated their intention to major in one of the mathematical or scientific  fields within the scope of the study. Women intending to major in engineering and physical science exhibited the same atypical performance. However, the large differences in mean SAT Mathematics performance found between women in mathematics, statistics, physics, and computer science versus those in engineering and the physical sciences disappeared when other measures were controlled for; and the effects of these measures were the same for both groups. Self-rating relative to others with respect to mathematics and science ability was the primary influential variable in the study. (TJH)",

While the concordance between the two methods for both White and Black students was very high (95 percent or better), the two classifications gave very disparate results for the other four racial/ethnic groups. For example, observers undercounted self-identified Hispanic 17-year-olds by 25 percent to 48 percent. Language background was significantly more consistent with self-identification than with observer reports for 17-year-old Hispanic students, which showed that  self-reports were more valid than observed ethnicity in this age group. However, the results for ages 9 and 13 years were less clear-cut. The implications of the findings for continuity of NAEP data sets and the validity of reported group achievement data for Hispanics are discussed. (Author)",

Initially, items were classified according to several possible explanatory factors. Preliminary analyses identified several factors that seemed to affect DIF for blacks. Secondly, these factors were further investigated by classifying and analyzing analogy items from two additional SAT forms. Results indicate that black students need more time to complete the SAT verbal sections than do their white counterparts with comparable overall SAT verbal scores. Once DIF statistics were corrected for speededness, a smaller number of analogy items were identified as differentially more difficult. Some  of the factors appear to be interdependent; these factors include item position within each analogy set, difficulty, subject content, and level of abstractness. The effects of homographs and semantic relationship types are also confounded with the previous factors. Generalizations to be drawn from these results are limited since analyses are based on regular administration items, which tend to have several factors operating in a single item and which contain infrequent occurrence of some factors.

The subjects' responses indicate that: (1) about 42 percent were enrolled in some type of full-time education; (2) 10.8 percent were unemployed; (3) employed  graduates usually worked in unskilled positions; (4) business, engineering/architecture, and medicine/health services were the most frequently chosen higher education paths; and (5) 72.9 percent felt that they were following their educational plans. Other areas of interest include graduates' career plans, perceived helpfulness of specific high school courses and experiences, and perceived importance of various adult survival skills.

Early intervention evaluation, which was initiated in 1969, involves those organized efforts designed to remediate and/or reconcile developmental disabilities in young children up to the age of 3 years. Previous research findings have resulted in considerable current research activity being conducted, much of which has attracted federal support. Also covered in the paper are the reasons that early intervention programming has not been proven, beyond all doubt, to be efficacious. A framework for program evaluators is provided to allow them to pinpoint the benefits of this kind of undertaking for the consumers of the  services.

Results indicate that high school mathematics average correlated best with college mathematics achievement for both the SAT and ACT.  For SAT mathematics test students, the SAT mathematics test score, gender, mathematics units, course program, and high school of attendance correlated with college mathematics achievement, in that order.

Results suggested that the ABAA Inventory was internally-consistent (alpha = .82) and stable over time (test-retest coefficient = .77). Subscale alphas ranged from .45 to .92, while subscale test-retest coefficients ranged from .59 to .89. A panel of experts determined that the instrument was representative of the domains under study, indicating content validity. Instrument construct validity was appraised using factor analysis. The initial factor analysis produced 15 factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. A principal component factor analysis, set at eight factors with a varimax rotation, produced eight  factors with eigenvalues ranging from 6.63 to 1.57. Convergent and discriminant construct validity were studied through general correlation matrices. As measured by the SMOG test, Inventory items were at the seventh grade reading level. The average time needed to complete the instrument ranged from 9.26 to 17.17 minutes. This paper describes the ABAA Inventory's psychometric properties as well as its applications in the school and community health setting. (Author)",

Validity of the CPM with different scoring modes was measured by Pearson product moment correlations between the scores on each administration of the CPM and the scores on other tests of general intelligence.

The areas of career and consumer decision-making are also reviewed. The extended Fishbein-Ajzen expectancy theory is recommended for modeling individual enlistment decisions. The Fishbein-Ajzen expectancy theory provides the following benefits: (1) use of behavioral intent and the explicit dependent variable; (2) a social component for explicit determination of the effect of influencers on individual  decisions; (3) a cognitive component for evaluating career options on specified belief attributes; (4) incorporation of affect in the form of the evaluation placed on each belief as well as its broad conceptual framework; and (5) facilitation of a multimeasurement approach for triangulating on decision model components. This report documents work completed during the first phase of a three-phase project. After this phase of the project, the Army will conduct a nationwide survey to validate the use of the models assessed in the first phase.

An autobiographical analysis of this relationship, in light of M. Foucault's analysis of the relationship between power and knowledge, is presented. A clear relationship between teacher training and application of that training in the classroom is lacking. A similar lack of relevance characterizes school curricula in relation to student experience. Avoiding an over-disciplinary stance by the teacher, and preventing a loss of teacher authority over students are best achieved by action-research based curriculum development. Participation in the approach developed by L. Stenhouse, through the Schools Council/Nuffield  Humanities Project (SCNHP), increased the level of action-research based development. The position of teacher appraisal within these systems is as part of a much broader strategy for transforming power relations in the educational system. In the SCNHP, the transition was made from developing school curriculum to developing teacher curriculum, and from a first-order action research to a second-order action research. The current situation, based on an agreement between the government, employers, and teachers' associations, is critiqued. (TJH)",

        "description":"A classification scheme for job performance measurement was developed by the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory (AFHRL) for development of individual job performance measures to validate Air Force selection and classification procedures. The job performance literature indicates that previous research relied heavily on broad-based generic indices, performance ratings, or operational measures with their inherent problems of inflation and halo effects. These broad measures were unable to take into account task-level-specific influences such as training differences or opportunities to perform. However, it appears that current interest, resources, and state-of-the-art technology developments have significantly increased the probability of developing successful measures of job  performance. The AFHRL study resulted in guidelines for developing and obtaining performance measures for a wide range of enlisted, officer, and civilian jobs. Research implications are associated with individual characteristics, rater-ratee relationships, measurement methods and scale development, scale characteristics, performance standards, social contexts, non-work variables, performance constraints, organizational norms, public relations and administrative procedures, rater training, intervening variables, measurement and research paradigms, and error variance.

        "description":"The 1986 Southern Regional Education Board/National Assessment of Educational Progress (SREB/NAEP) testing project included Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The tests used in the SREB/NAEP consisted of selected reading and writing exercises developed and administered to a sample of 11th-grade students by the NAEP. In reading and writing, students in the majority of the participating SREB states are achieving at the national average; overall scores from all participating states matched the Southern regional average. Achievement differences in reading between blacks and whites and between males and females are basically the same in the SREB states as in the nation as a whole. Other results indicate that: (1) the  states have the most current and reliable measure of how their students' achievement in reading and writing compares to truly national and regional results; (2) student achievement can be assessed in ways that make state, regional, and national comparisons possible; (3) the NAEP provides information about students who are achieving beyond minimum levels; (4) the SREB sample is representative; and (5) the SREB program can provide insights to the college readiness of students.

        "description":"As part of the United States Army's Project A, research has been conducted to develop and field test a battery of experimental tests to complement the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery in predicting soldiers' job performance. Project A is the United States Army's large-scale manpower effort to improve selection, classification, and utilization of enlisted personnel. Findings from an extensive literature review and associated expert judgments and administration of a preliminary battery of &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; measures guided the development of new tests. Three major types of tests were prepared, namely, paper-and-pencil tests of cognitive ability; computer-administered tests of perceptual and psychomotor abilities; and paper-and-pencil inventories measuring temperament,  biographical data, and vocational interests. After iterative pilot tests and revisions, the measures were field tested. Analysis indicted that the new tests had adequate to excellent psychometric qualities, were relatively unique, and were not unduly affected by practice or by faking in an applicant setting. The resulting trial battery contains six cognitive tests; 10 computer-administered perceptual and psychomotor tests; and two inventories measuring temperament, biographical factors, and interests. The battery is being used in the next Project A phase, which involves concurrent validation to evaluate predictor measures against subsequent job performance. (TJH)",

It consists of five subscales: Self-Evaluation, Social and Peer Relations, Family Relations, Sense of Mastery, and Emotional Well-Being/Distress, plus a total scale score as an indicator of overall positive self-concept and functioning. The instrument has been administered to approximately 1,000 children in grades 5-12, and norms are currently being established. Whole scale reliability (alpha) ranged from 0.93 to 0.95, and subscale reliabilities ranged from 0.69 to 0.90, with a mean of 0.84; these are higher than any published reliability coefficients for  similar measures. In addition, other measures administered concurrently in an in-depth study of 43 fifth graders indicate good convergent and criterion validity for the instrument. Comparisons between this scale and other measures are summarized in chart form. (Author/SLD)",

The framework for analysis was a classification scheme with reader response recorded on a matrix form for reader response mode and focus, and writer response classified as stock or categorized; elaborations or explanations; and questions, corrections, or disagreements. Portrayal of the conferencing session was explored through the use of transcripts compared with the use of graphic and narrative summaries.

A distinction can be made between a process-oriented or diagnostic test and an outcomes-oriented test such as the SAT. Since the SAT does not aim to be a diagnostic test, the implications of cognitive theories for test construction that would otherwise be applicable are not emphasized. Nevertheless, an analysis based on quantitative items illustrates how tests with a diagnostic orientation could be based on cognitive principles. An explication was developed for the linkage of cognitive principles with psychometric considerations for an outcomes-oriented test. The  essence of that linkage is an accounting of item difficulty. The understanding of differential difficulty among items can be viewed as an additional requirement for construct validity, which until recently, focused almost exclusively on an accounting of the co-variation of test scores in terms of &quot;abilities.&quot; Although work from this enlarged validational perspective on SAT items is limited, there is work based on similar items that suggests that the SAT will fare well when relevant studies are conducted. Future studies should be based on an enlarged validational framework. A nine-page list of references is included. (TJH)",

The methods require only a single test administration and are computationally simple. Both are based on the Spearman-Brown formula for estimating stepped-up reliability. The non-distributional method requires only that the test be divisible into parallel half-tests; the normal method makes the additional assumption of normally distributed test scores. Bias for the two procedures is investigated by simulation, using a Monte Carlo study. For nearly normal test score distributions, the normal method performs slightly better than does the non-distributional method, but for moderately to severely skewed or symmetric platykurtic  test score distributions, the non-distributional method is superior. Test results from a licensure examination are tabulated to illustrate the methods. (Author/SLD)",

The Levine and congeneric methods make assumptions about true score regressions and are based on linear structural models. The analysis is graphically illustrated using data from actual test administrations. If groups differ greatly as shown by their performance in the anchor and if application of Tucker's equating method is not tenable, the disattenuated  correlation between Y and V should be computed. If this disattenuated correlation is significantly less than unity, the Levine method should not be used, and the congeneric method becomes an appealing alternative. (SLD)",

Field notes, publications, and interviews were used to study the research process. During the study, researchers seemed to undergo a paradigm shift from viewing teachers as controlled by  state authorities, with behavior modifiable by positive reinforcement, to viewing them as active participants in the research process. Teachers seemed to welcome the new role, but needed time away from teaching to involve themselves in the research process. The world of teachers was relatively more isolated and rigid than that of researchers with regard to constraining organizational policies. To be successful, collaborative attempts to relate the worlds of policy, resarch, and practice must consider the implications of these differences in the worlds of teachers and researchers. (SLD)",

This study investigates, via participant observation, the inner workings of a highly successful research group. Observation, interviews, and surveys were used to study the workings of the research group. Over the course of the study, researchers tended to change their perception of teachers as being dominated by the system and responsive to positive reinforcement, to perceptions of teachers as partners in research and more autonomous decision makers. The researchers maintained a belief in the value of wait time. Teachers felt uncomfortable at first with the Wait Timer and did not become convinced that wait time could be used  because of the pressure to cover material at a fast pace. The teachers' were eager to take on a more active role in the research process, despite the severe constraints imposed on their time. Students came to have generally positive views about wait time. The research process became a process of mutual adaptation with less emphasis on the prescription of wait time and more emphasis on dealing with teacher concerns. User uncertainty, resistance, teachers' dilemmas of being at odds with their job description, and questions regarding the relevance of wait time for teaching will need further study. (SLD)",

The \"Study Interest Questionnaire\" (Winteler and Sierwald, 1987) and a questionnaire on interest in empirical research methodology were administered to 21 freshmen education students with little prior knowledge of methodology and 17 control subjects. Students who had a high degree of interest at the beginning of the semester had a greater proportion of technically appropriate word associations in response to subject matter stimulus terms. Qualitative differences in knowledge existed, confirming that topic interest has an impact on knowledge acquisition. The methodology interest  questionnaire is presented; and the results are provided in two tables, two graphs, and three flowcharts. (SLD)",

Results supported previous findings that, for this population, there exists a weak analytical factor defined by the logical reasoning items and not by the analytical reasoning items. This finding was more straightforward than the same finding based on the full-information factor analysis (FIFA) approach used in the previous study; however, an advantage of FIFA was that it allowed the researcher to assess the proportion of variance explained by each factor in the orthogonal solution--the CMIRT approach is  unlikely to yield such a statistic. Examination of the results shows the CMIRT approach to hold much promise. (SLD)",

        "description":"According to recent studies, families with children are now the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population: 40 percent of the homeless population consists of members of families. Forty-three percent of homeless children do not attend school, which provides children with a much-needed sense of place and continuity that they otherwise lack in their fragmented lives. Homeless children are deprived of their education in several ways: in some cases state or local &quot;residency&quot; requirements operate specifically to bar children without a fixed residence from attending school; in other cases the means necessary to obtain education--adequate transportation, school and medical records, special education programs, guardianship rules--are lacking. In July 1987 Federal legislation was  enacted that for the first time addresses this issue: under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act state agencies are to ensure that homeless children have access to public education. Under the Act the Department of Education (DOE) was to make funds available to state authorities expeditiously, so that local programs would be operating before December 31, 1987. Contrary to this mandate, DOE has delayed implementation of the program, and has issued guidelines that, in effect, will make homeless children lose a school year. The DOE should rewrite its guidelines to expedite implementation of the program and to make badly-needed aid available. An appendix describes local programs that address the needs of homeless children in the following areas: (1) Salt Lake City, Utah; (2) San  Diego, California; (3) Santa Clara, California; (4) State of Connecticut; (5) New York, New York. Another appendix is a reprint of &quot;Subtitle B--Education of Homeless Children and Youth,&quot; from the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. (BJV)",

        "description":"Legislation is being considered to authorize grants from the Department of Education for dropout prevention programs, reentry demonstration programs, and high school programs for certain welfare recipients instead of mandatory work or job training. There is also a call for the use of Job Training Partnership Act Summer Youth Program funds to be used year-round for basic and remedial education for teenage welfare recipients. The need for federal involvement with the dropout problem is demonstrated by the difficulties in obtaining good data on dropouts. Comparisons are nearly impossible since states and local school districts have different definitions and counting procedures. The national estimates which are widely used place the dropout rate between 14 and 29 per cent. Often the  students who drop out have not done well in school, but for each individual, a host of possible reasons may be identified. It is difficult to develop prevention efforts and reentry programs which will successfully address all of the possible factors. For some dropouts numerous social and personal problems are so severe that having a diploma may not make much of a difference in their ability to obtain and maintain employment. From this perspective, programs that attempt simply to get more students through school may be difficult to justify. (VM)",

        "description":"National surveys of the post-high school plans and aspirations of black and white high school seniors have been conducted for the past decade. Chances of college entry among blacks from 1977 through the mid-1980s have declined in contrast to the increasing college entry chances of whites. This paper analyses the plans of black and white seniors and shows that they have followed a similar path. There is little evidence that a change in values or motivation among black seniors accounts for the decline in their chances of college entry. Plans and aspirations to complete a four-year college have increased among both blacks and whites. Aspirations to enter the armed forces have also increased in the two groups. No particular trend has been found in their plans to attend vocational,  technical and two-year colleges. The findings indicate the need for future research to account for the decline in chances of college entry for blacks. Specific factors to be examined are the following: (1) lagging trends in college graduation among blacks and whites; (2) patterns of entry into the military service; (3) changes in the labor market for recent high school graduates; and (4) the availability of direct grants to support college attendance.

Remedial Reading and Mathematics Program which served approximately 11,500 English-speaking and limited English Proficient (LEP) students. Of these, 9,627 received reading instruction alone, and 119 received remedial instruction in Spanish. In the public schools, a total of 1,978 students received instruction in mathematics, some also receiving instruction in reading. To measure academic progress English language students took standardized pre- and posttests in reading or mathematics. Consultants observed a holistic approach to reading instruction at 89 percent of the sites visited. Teachers reported favorably on the use of the computer as a motivating learning tool.  They requested more materials for LEP students. Reading and math instruction was integrated through the use of word problems and vocabulary study, and an emphasis on practical skills. The student achievement objective for reading in English was not met. However, the mean normal curve equivalent gain in reading comprehension from pretest to posttest was statistically significant. The program objective for the 119 students who were taught reading in Spanish was partially met. The program objective for the students receiving remedial instruction in math was also met. The following recommendations are made for the next program cycle: (1) increase the availability of materials in the LEP and mathematics programs; (2) continue staff development, including the use of innovative materials and a  holistic approach to teaching; and (3) review the appropriateness of student assignments to test levels on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests.

Data on the 575 student participants in the JTPA Extended School Day Programs are given on composition by age, grade, gender, race, and handicapped status. Of the youth served by Extended Day Programs, 49 percent remained in school and attended regularly, and 51 percent left school for a variety of reasons. Of the grade 12 Program graduates, 53 percent went into private sector unsubsidized jobs, and 24 percent went to a community college. Although  the objectives set for the JTPA Spring Start-Up Extended School Day Programs were not met in all schools, the schools are now better prepared to begin program operation during the 1987-88 school year. The JTPA Dropout Youth Projects attempted to recruit Indian and migrant youth dropouts into secondary schools and to provide them with opportunities to complete school and to obtain pre-employment skills training. A total of 238 contacts were made and 39 dropouts were recruited and enrolled. Staff ratings of the Projects, information on the Project's budget and participants, and recommendations are included. Data are presented on 13 tables and figures. An appendix presents the results of the Extended School Day Programs Survey. (BJV)",

        "description":"This report reviews the progress of demonstration projects that reduce refugee welfare dependency, promote earlier refugee employment and self-sufficiency, and foster coordination among public and private agencies that work with refugees. The projects used the following three methods: (1) removing welfare provisions that took away some cash assistance upon employment; (2) expanding the voluntary agency role in providing refugee case management services and cash assistance previously managed by the State Welfare Department; and (3) providing a full range of refugee services through individual voluntary agencies instead of providing each service separately through government entities. Three demonstration programs have been implemented and progress has been slower than expected.  They lack the proper funding levels, and there is little incentive for the agencies involved to accommodate alternative approaches that put them in competition with existing programs for funding. Difficulties have surfaced in obtaining workable agreements to spread the roles and responsibilities among public and private agencies. Two of the projects are still incomplete and they may ultimately be shown to be successful. No additional projects are recommended. (VM)",

Some of their suggestions were the following: (1) increase the budget for housing and housing programs; (2) establish a more comprehensive policy which considers the needs of low  income people; (3) give incentives to private enterprises which put a priority on housing rather than on commercial buildings; (4) plan mechanisms to foster partnerships between the Federal Government and local groups involved with housing; (5) establish a national homeowners trust fund to help working people with down payments; (6) amend tax laws to create incentives for developers of low income housing and multiple unit rental housing; and (7) support the Homeless Persons Survival Act.

        "author":["Singer, Eliot A."],
        "description":"Certain scholars in anthropology and education have recently suggested as an approach to combat school failure for minority students the concept of cultural congruence--the idea that learning is best accomplished in classrooms compatible with the cultural context of the communities they are supposed to serve. Although this concept is yet to be fully articulated as theory or extensively realized in practice, it has already received considerable criticism for &quot;blaming the victim,&quot; for denying the possibility of &quot;breaking with experience,&quot; and for being too difficult for practicing teachers to apply. This paper attempts to clarify just what is meant by cultural congruence, and argues that most of these criticisms assume a far more total merger of community and school than the modest  and limited model favored by proponents of cultural congruence, who are simply talking about minimizing differences in speaking and social interactional styles in the classroom. In this limited form, cultural congruence can be a useful addition to educators' repertoire for dealing with minority education. A six-page list of references is included. (Author/BJV)",

It is based on a seminar comprised of educational researchers held to consider how low achieving students can best be helped. The research agenda for such a center should consider the following four factors in the lives of educationally disadvantaged students: (1) classroom and instructional factors; (2) school factors; (3) home or family factors; and (4) community factors. Recent research on effective schools must be consulted, the variables within these models are especially critical for high educational attainment among disadvantaged youth. Successful innovations will have positive effects on low, average, and high  achieving students as well as those at risk. The research program for a special study center should have the following characteristics: (1) sensitivity to interaction effects; (2) cross-disciplinary approach; (3) sensitivity to the need for early identification; and (4) sufficient scope and rigor to allow the findings to be generalized to disadvantaged youth anywhere.

        "author":["Stedman, James B."],
        "description":"This paper focuses on three groups of children and youth who appear to be at risk for depressed educational attainment. The groups are those from single parent families, those from persistently poor families, and those who give birth during their teenage years. A significant number of the country's children and youth are from these groups. School policies and practices play a significant role in the educational attainment process for them, as do the expectations that school personnel have for these students and others and the ways that schools interact with the parents of these students. Family income is another important factor. A key finding is that there is no single cause of depressed educational attainment for any of the three groups in question. Some policy implications of  these findings are the following: (1) programs should be developed that respond to a combination of the contributing factors, such as remedial instruction for both students and parents; (2) policies and programs should attempt to reduce income factors associated with low educational attainment; (3) programs should have research functions built into them for longitudinal studies; (4) policies should be flexible, taking into account the dynamic nature of the target population; and (5) policies must strengthen the interaction between these groups and the schools.

Part One is a preamble that presents the findings that demonstrate the need for special attention to this population. It also states the legislative objective--to enable each child to graduate from high school and to become a productive, responsible citizen. Part Two calls for pre-school child development programs for young children who are at risk, especially low-income children who  have limited English proficiency. Part Three defines the concept of \"at risk\" for children at various stages. There is a call for flexibility so that the programs may include assistance to children who are not from low-income families but who perform poorly. Part Four establishes an entitlement for dropouts. Programs are specified which can be provided in the public schools or in alternative settings. Part Five specifies measures for implementation, enforcement, and administration of the statute. (VM)",

Research is presently being conducted on parent involvement and its effect on student learning. Good teacher-student interaction is crucial to effective learning. Teachers must have high expectations for students. Their techniques for transferring knowledge must be efficient and thorough. If used properly, methods such as mastery learning can improve achievement. Principals of effective schools must have high expectations for students. Strong instructional leadership techniques will make it clear that learning is the focus of the school. A positive school climate can be maintained if administrators are supportive of teacher needs and institute a joint decision-making process.  While teachers and principals are responsible for developing strong ties between school and home, parents can try to maintain a positive home environment which is conducive to academic achievement. The important home factors include the following: (1) work habits and daily schedule of the family; (2) available parental guidance, support, and assistance for the child's school and homework; (3) intellectual stimulation; (4) language development; and (5) parents' academic aspirations and expectations. More research is needed to know if effective school techniques are applicable to all students at all grade levels. (VM)",

Studies show that urban patterns of poverty, early parenthood, and other social ills make urban school children at high risk for academic failure. There is a critical shortage of teachers in urban schools especially minority teachers. In addition, many of the present teachers are not trained for urban teaching. Teacher training institutions must develop new programs to train, recruit, and retain properly trained teachers. The programs must include faculty and curricula which effectively prepare students for the urban school experience. Full year, supervised intern teaching in an urban setting should be required before  certification. The monograph contains discussions on the following topics: (1) the educational reform literature; (2) the continuing and increasing need for teachers in urban schools; (3) admission criteria for teacher education programs; and (5) the future: combining the two worlds of teacher education, the one which relates directly to urban life and the one which is university based and does not confront urban issues automatically. An appendix summarizes the teacher education portions of major reports on school reform. A questionnaire for teacher education candidates is included. The bibliography contains 62 items. (VM)",

Whereas many jobs in industries such as insurance and banking once required high school graduates to do clerical work, computerization has changed the requirements. Job functions are combined, and many jobs now require college graduates to do analytical work. Although these skill changes require reforms in education such as those currently occurring, other more sweeping, as yet formless, reforms are needed in the educational system. The educational system defines skills and successes in terms of rather narrow academic criteria, whereas success in the real world can take a number of paths. Success in academic pursuits is not necessarily predictive of success in work, and failure in academic skill, beyond a certain basic universally  needed level, does not necessarily presage work failure. Society needs and rewards many talents and attributes neither taught nor valued in academic institutions. Therefore, the next wave of educational reform needs to address the issue of how to help children make the best use of their individual talents. Children also should be taught real world-of-work values such as cooperation and team effort, as children in Japan are often taught. (KC)",

Anecdotal reports were collected from mentors and mentees and indepth interviews were conducted with mentors before or at the beginning of the mentoring experience and after it was officially over. Mentees were also interviewed after the experience. Data suggested four critical factors, above and beyond competence and potential, that mentors use, knowingly and unknowingly, in selecting potential mentees: fit, risk,  predictability, and payoff. The research suggested that use of these factors in screening potential mentees helps explain why women may receive less mentoring and have a harder time attracting mentors. Women tended to get lower scores in fit, predictability, and payoff than similarly able and qualified men and higher scores in risk, which is more likely to put their total scores outside the mentor's \"comfort zone.\" A construct of how mentoring works and the components of the construct emerged from the research. Further tests of its validity were seen as necessary. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study of the implementation of national core curricula in Australia was undertaken by seeking the general views, through interview and questionnaire, of curriculum developers and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) teachers who develop and deliver the curricula. Views of representatives of industry and commerce who employ students who are trained using those curricula were also solicited. These general views were complemented by specific views obtained in three case studies. The role of the Curriculum Projects Steering Group (CPSG) in the implementation process was a matter of particular interest. Although the work of of the CPSG had the general support of both industry and bodies such as the Australian Council on Employment and Training, they also pressured it to make  changes to its procedures. General conclusions reached were that the CPSG guided the development and implementation of national core curricula very well and, that in continuing its valuable work, its procedures should not be changed lightly. Nevertheless, several steps were recommended to improve the implementation of the national core curricula. (The three case studies that illustrate how the issues applied to a particular national core curriculum are described in detail, and appendixes include the study instruments, an outline giving minimum curriculum documentation requirements, and a table showing the nature and status of the national curriculum projects.

        "description":"It is especially important that teachers working in classrooms in rural areas of developing countries select instructional technologies that are appropriate, pedagogically sound, innovative, cost-effective, and manageable. When selecting the instructional media that will be used in a particular classroom situation, teachers should remember that the formal classroom is a social system in and of itself. Although media can never be a substitute for good two-way communication between teacher and student, it can enhance the teaching-learning process and is particularly valuable as a tool for reaching learners who are widely dispersed over vast geographical areas. Numerous research studies have evaluated the pros and cons of radio, tape-slide presentation, peer tutoring, and media and  classroom ethos. Radiovision appears especially promising as an instructional medium in developing nations. Radiovision is an instructional system in which subject matter is presented through both audio and visual channels. It is a system in which students look at visuals that are presented on the screen through slide projectors, filmstrips, charts, models, and other media, and listen to explanations via a cassette player. Compared with television, radiovision is more economical, more favorable to student viewers, more easily manipulated (in the sense that material can be more easily played back), and capable of being produced by using a combination of classroom- and commercially-developed materials.

The writer must write before the new literates can read and must write both effectively and interestingly. Although talent helps, acquired skills play an important part in writing, especially in expository writing. More important, to enable them to produce good expository writing, the new writers must be provided assistance in the process of \"message making\" or getting the message across to the reader. A proposed model of message-making illustrates that the process of decision making when developing a message in print is neither linear nor one-directional. Major steps in the model are selection of subject or topic; definition of general and specific objectives; content planning in the  field; the choice of appropriate literary treatment; development and outlining of the argument of the book; development of subject-matter skills and collaboration with subject-matter specialists; vocabulary research by the writer; writing to be read and to be understood; pretest of material for feedback; and working with the illustrator and the editor. The writer must also keep in mind the problems of adaptations and translations. (YLB)",

        "description":"Economic changes and demographic realities may require fundamental changes in what individuals need to learn, how and when they need to learn it, and who needs to learn it. Examination of three strands of research should clarify these issues. The first strand consists of research on changes in the nature and structure of work and in the capacities required for work: it bears on what schools should teach. This research shows that both the service and manufacturing industries are moving from a production-oriented to a product-oriented world, from mass production to flexible production. These changes require both basic skills and more higher order thinking, even for jobs that are usually thought of as lower skill. The second strand of research relates to how schools should teach.  This strand is pioneering work in cognitive psychology on nonschool learning and its implications for how formal learning is restructured. This work implicitly challenges the traditional distinctions between head and hand, academic and vocational education, education and training, and school-based and work-based learning. The final research strand involves at-risk learners as rational decision makers. This research suggests that school-based learning is not particularly related to out-of-school activity for any individual; however, what is taught in traditional schools and remedial programs seems less relevant to those persons who lack the ability or desire to enter professional occupations.

        "description":"This paper identifies some recent dimensions of labor market restructuring, based on an analysis of change in the United States economy. Information was drawn from a number of service industries, including retailing, telecommunications, insurance, banking, advertising, accounting, and other business services. Following an introduction that defines the nature and purpose of the paper, Section 2 reviews some of the key factors behind the transformation in the demand for labor. They include increasing the competition and the introduction of new technology--two of the main forces that have resulted in the trend towards \"vertical disintegration\" and the rise in the demand for \"contingent labor.\" Section 3 examines some principal forces that have transformed the labor supply, including  growth in the pool of available part-time workers, the rise in the number of two wage-earner households, and rising educational attainment. The paper also points to the response by firms to some of these forces and specifically to the trend toward the dismantling of internal labor markets. In Section 4, the emergence of new labor markets structured around segments of core and contingent workers is hypothesized. These new segments are shown to differ widely from the so-called primary and secondary labor segments characteristic of the industrial dualism of the post-war years. (KC)",

        "description":"Vocational educators, policymakers, and Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) service providers are developing an increasing awareness of the educational and economic benefits of joint planning and coordination between vocational education and the JTPA. However, some basic differences between the goals, planning procedures, and operating practices of the public and private sectors have, in many cases, made efforts to establish and implement cooperative vocational education-JTPA programs difficult. For example, vocational education's concerns for long-term educational development and its mandate to serve the general in-school population stand in contrast to JTPA's focus on short-term training programs that concentrate on job- or employer-specific skill needs. Research has revealed  several steps that employers and JTPA trainers alike can take to improve intersector coordination. These include improving communication through such strategies as holding joint conferences or hiring staff members with experience in the other delivery system, reducing the risk of performance-based contracts to educational institutions by providing partial payment for outcomes (such as course completion) over which educational institutions have more control than they do over employment outcomes, and supplementing on-the-job training to broaden the preparation of clients and increase their attractiveness to employers. A national study of joint planning during 1986 found little in the way of coordination during that particular year. A second study undertaken the following year was more  encouraging, however. (MN)",

        "description":"The educational excellence movement has made an academic curriculum a high priority for all high school students, including the 40 percent who do not go on to college. The joint efforts approach to incorporating basic skills into the vocational curriculum is based on the following assumptions: (1) academic skills are embedded in vocational education; (2) vocational tasks provide for realistic use of academic basic skills, and connecting academic learning with application strengthens students' basic skills; and (3) neither academic basic skills nor vocational skills should be taught in isolation from each other. Vocational and academic teachers who desire to develop an integrated and articulated program in which vocational students can receive instruction in the basic skills have  three main options: sharing, teaming, and crossing over (from vocational to academic education or vice versa). Each of these options can be used in all types of programs, including traditional vocational programs, compensatory and support-oriented programs, and alternative programs such as those based on learning centers and laboratories. Student learning contracts, visiting consultants or specialists, cooperative programs, competency-based education, applied learning in a problem-solving mode, and Academic Development Plans (ADPs) are all effective in programs infusing academic instruction into the vocational curriculum. Like Individualized Education Plans, ADPs describe a student's present level of educational performance, state annual goals, and identify appropriate objective criteria,  evaluation procedures, and schedules for determining whether or not these objectives are being achieved.

        "description":"During the first half of the 1980s, the focus of the literacy movement was on strengthening literacy programs through the recruitment of volunteers. Although these early efforts are continuing, the focus in adult literacy has changed. Job-related or workplace literacy has become a national priority, and the impact of adult illiteracy on private industry is becoming increasingly visible. Demographic factors and changes in jobs are also creating a need for workplace literacy programs. Workplace literacy and general literacy differ in purpose. A number of recent studies have examined the literacy skills that individuals need in order to succeed in the workplace. These studies have resulted in the publication of a number of lists of work-related reading, writing, speaking, listening,  mathematics, scientific, and reasoning skills. Industry-based literacy approaches can be divided into two groups: (1) pre-1980, viewed primarily as traditional benefits for the employee, and (2) post-1980, viewed primarily as instruments for achieving the company's advanced technology goals. Unlike traditional literacy programs, which were generally initiated in an era of company prosperity and security, the new literacy skills programs were initiated in an era of foreign competition and rapid technological change in response to the realization that many employees lacked the basic skills with which to acquire more technical skills. Most industry-based literacy training occurs on the company site, partly for the sake of employee convenience and partly because many employees find schoolroom  environments inhibiting. Several guides to developing workplace literacy programs have been published, and four of these are briefly described. A list of 12 references is also provided. (MN)",

        "description":"The technological advances that have occurred in recent decades have resulted in substantial changes in the nature and structure of occupations and industries. Career development is now being recognized as a lifelong process. Individualized career plans (ICPs) or personal plans of action are becoming important instruments for counselors and others to use in helping their students and/or clients meet their changing goals, interests, and needs in today's rapidly changing society. An ICP can be both a tool and a procedure that individuals can use by themselves or with others to implement and monitor their own career development. Rather than a rigid track, a good ICP can provide a renewed focus for an individual's life. Good ICPs are comprehensive, developmental, person centered, and  competency based. It has been suggested that the various life roles be used to provide the main section of a plan and that each plan contain a section in which individuals can project their own future career growth. These life roles include the following: worker, consumer/citizen, learner, and family member roles. The ICP model lends itself well to various formats and modifications, it can be targeted in many directions, and it is adaptable for use at all levels of schooling as well as in employment and training agencies. ICPs can also be developed to assist disabled students and working women. The career passport, which is a variation of the ICP model, presents a systematic process for developing an experience-based resume that documents nonwork as well as work experiences and details  the skills, attitudes, and knowledge gained through these experiences.

        "description":"Participation in work activities by high school students has been increasing over the past 25 years to the point where today at least one-third of all high school students hold part-time jobs in any given week. Student participation in work varies by geographic region and type of community, with older, white, middle-class, male vocational students from the Northeast and north central region being the most likely to be employed. Although students may be found working in all industries, they tend to be concentrated in wholesale/retail trade, service, and agriculture/forestry/fishing. Male students tend to work more hours than female students, and white students work more than do minority students. Weekly income averages $60-$70, with males earning more on average than females. The  effect of working on grades is unclear. There seems to be a curvilinear relationship between hours worked and grades, with 20 hours being the point where a negative effect emerges. Working appears to have little effect on educational plans but is positively associated with employment and income after high school completion, at least in the short range. Working during high school appears to promote desirable work habits. In general, relationships with parents and siblings are not affected by working. Findings regarding the effect of working on delinquent behavior are inconclusive and contradictory. There is a general need for improved and more comprehensive data related to youth and work; in addition, a common set of measures regarding working, reasons for working, the multiple dimensions  of student work experiences, and the multiple attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of working is needed.

Verified scores on the ACT Interest Inventory were correlated with logic, insight, divergent-thinking, and creative-thinking test scores as well as with scores on measures of IQ and achievement. Two patterns of relationship were found. On the one hand, interest in science correlated with logic, insight, IQ, and achievement. On the other, interest in the arts correlated with logic, divergent thinking, and creative thinking, but not with IQ or achievement. When IQ was controlled, first-order partial correlations between scientific interests and logic and artistic interests, logic, divergent thinking, and  creative thinking remained significant.

        "description":"This paper examines the study plan for the National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE) and outlines some of the preliminary results that have been determined to date. According to the paper, the NAVE has identified five broad areas in which to conduct research: (1) implementation of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act; (2) vocational education for special populations; (3) conditions of secondary vocational education; (4) conditions of postsecondary vocational education; and (5) the changing economy and its skill requirements. A section of the paper describes the studies being conducted to evaluate these five areas. The paper also points out some of the constraints of the NAVE, such as the following: (1) it is being conducted internally by the U.S. Department of  Education rather than through a third-party contract; (2) postsecondary and secondary vocational training are pitted against each other; (3) the study plan does not seem to address the primary responsibilities historically assigned to vocational education; and (4) certain statements in the study plan seem to question the need for vocational education. A short section sketching some preliminary results shows that nearly all students take some type of vocational education, accounting for 20 percent of the courses that are taken by the average student who graduates from high school. The study data also indicate that vocational students take vocational education by adding credits, whereas college-bound students cut into their academic core subjects to take vocational education. Finally, the  data suggest that vocational enrollments are declining and that more work is needed in giving disadvantaged students access to vocational education. (KC)",

Among adolescents with unemployed parents, ethnic origin was associated with present unemployment but also with plans to be employed full-time after graduation.

A Post-High School Plans Survey was administered to 186 seniors in Northern California; a subsample of 32 students was interviewed to assess identity, exploitation, and commitment. Three types of goal orientations (task, self, social) were analyzed in relation to four decision outcome categories (four-year college, junior college, noncollege, undecided) and the decision-making processes involved. The post-high school decision-making process was related to students' perceptions of this time as initiating the transition to adulthood in two significant ways. First, if students perceived that upon leaving  high school they were entering new roles and requirements as young adults, they were more likely to initiate the thinking and goal-setting necessary to establish a path into adulthood. Second, students who perceived themselves as involved in adult development were more likely to have stronger goals and higher levels of thinking during the transition to adulthood. The most promising decision-making profile was associated with students' perceptions of adulthood as being initiated during high school years but continuing on into the mid-20s. Students with a sense of the \"big picture\" of adulthood were better able to evaluate alternatives as they left high school and to select a career that reflected their commitment to a particular identity.

        "description":"Phase I of a study was conducted to identify the basic mathematics competencies needed for job success in office occupations (14 job clusters). It also sought to determine the differences between employees' and employer/supervisors' perceptions of the degree of importance of mathematics skills for office occupations. Following a review of literature, a preliminary list of business and office mathematics skills was submitted to an advisory committee of business teachers, field tested, and refined into a questionnaire that contained a list of 36 basic mathematics skills and 30 mathematics-related business skills. Survey forms were created and sent to 1,652 employees and 288 employer/supervisors at 58 businesses in Louisiana, with responses returned by 854 employees and 171  employer/supervisors. Tables were prepared showing ratings of mathematics skills by each of the respondent groups and by businesses by size. The most important skills cited by all respondents were adding/subtracting whole numbers, using 10-key adding machine or calculator, multiplying/dividing whole numbers, and using computer terminals for data entry and output. In only three categories (bank teller, bookkeeping/accounting clerk, and secretary) was there significant disagreement between employees and employers, according to a chi-square analysis. Most of the employees were satisfied with their mathematics preparation in school. The findings from the study were used as the basis for the development of a curriculum guide for Louisiana. (KC)",

Achievement of sequential goals should help each student qualify for a position in the world of work. Stressing communication skills can help prepare students for whatever work they choose. Learning opportunities for students to achieve objectives need to follow selected principles of learning from the psychology of education. These principles include the following: (1) secure the student's interest; (2) help students perceive meaning in ongoing tasks; (3) meet student needs; (4) provide sequential learning for students; (5) provide positive reinforcement; and (6) accept each student. Students should be evaluated so that teachers can determine what students have not understood. The  teacher should also conduct self-appraisal by asking such questions as \"Were students interested in the learing opportunities?\"; \"Was an appropriate sequence used?\"; \"Were students given assistance as needed?\" Vocational education needs to emphasize the concept of excellence in the curriculum. Excellence in teaching and excellence in student achievement are musts in ongoing course work. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined Work Incentive (WIN) Demonstration programs in four states. The following programs were reviewed: Employment and Training Choices (in Massachusetts), Michigan Opportunity and Skills Training, the Employment Services Program (in Texas), and JOBS (in Oregon). A strict, across-the-board analysis of the programs was difficult because of differences in the way different services were defined in the four programs and because of many gaps and discrepancies in the information available about the individual programs. The Massachusetts and Michigan programs were the most complex, offering multiple services and providers, in contrast to the Oregon and Texas programs, each of which provides one primary service. Massachusetts relied on federal funds to finance only 35 percent  of its program, whereas Michigan's was about half federally funded and the Texas and Oregon programs each used a little more than 70 percent federal funds. Comparable percentages of adult Aid to Families with Dependent Children clients were counted as employment program participants in each of the four states. The Texas and Oregon programs emphasized job search, whereas the Michigan and Massachusetts programs stressed education and training activities. All four programs use some services provided by nonwelfare agencies, with Massachusetts making the most use of outside services (usually arranged with performance-based contracts) and Oregon using them the least. Massachusetts was the only state to place a major emphasis on child care (funding child care for clients before and after they  find a job). Program staff in the other states frequently urge participants to find care on their own before starting the program. Placement rates were available only for Massachusetts and Michigan (38 and 37 percent respectively), with Massachusetts program completers earning higher average wages than completers of the other three programs.

        "description":"Ventures in Community Improvement (VICI) is a program that provides intensive training in construction skills to disadvantaged youth and at the same time allows them to produce tangible improvements in housing and public facilities in their own low-income communities. The model was tested twice previously, once in an eight-state demonstration that served 16- to 19-year-olds (in the late 1970s) and once in a demonstration involving women aged 18 to 35 (in the mid-1980s). Both demonstrations confirmed the model's effectiveness in helping disadvantaged persons earn higher wages than their counterparts who were not served by the program. A third demonstration of the VICI model was conducted in four cities: the Bay Area of northern California; Cleveland, Ohio; Houston, Texas, and  Dallas, Texas, between 1984 and 1987. These projects, which were sponsored by Standard Oil/BP America, served both men and women between the ages of 18 and 24 in several cycles over an 18-month period. Despite the fact that this third demonstration was conducted in a climate of reduced national funding, all had positive outcomes. The VICI trainees produced work of tangible value, and in the two sites where a work value analysis was conducted, the value of the work produced exceeded the wages paid to the trainees. Overall, the job placement rates in the third demonstration were slightly higher than those of the two previous demonstrations. Moreover, two sites and one cycle from a third site surpassed the job placement rates produced by the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) system, with  postprogram wages across the sites 40 percent higher than those earned by JTPA trainees.

The paper is divided into three main sections: (1) the description of the system, which includes descriptions of the providers of education and training programs and the options available to youths in pursuing education and training; (2) issues and government policies and provisions bearing on these providers and options; and (3) a review of the research evidence on special topics  related to this age group. The following are among the conclusions of the study: (1) postsecondary educational and training opportunities for this age group are diverse and flexible; (2) coordinated standards of measurement are lacking; (3) the private sector has become the dominant provider of postsecondary training; and (4) the lack of an explicit national policy produces a lack of coordination among components of the system which may make it more difficult for young people to make informed choices; at the same time, such diversity produces a wide variety of choices and second chances.

A multimethod approach, consisting of a literature search, interviews with certified financial planners, and input from advisory committees, was used to develop the survey instrument. A random sample of 1,815 financial planners was asked to rate the importance of 51 job tasks (reduced to an 11-factor job structure related to marketing financial planning services, interviewing clients, explaining financial planning issues and concepts, analyzing client  circumstances, developing comprehensive financial plans, implementing and monitoring financial products, monitoring financial plans, complying with requirements, managing a planning practice, and consulting with other professionals) and 99 knowledge areas listed under six headings: risk management and general, investment, tax, retirement, and estate planning. Of the 1,815 surveys mailed out, 621 were completed and returned; 566 (91 percent) of the returned survey forms were used. With the exception of marketing and managing a financial planning practice, all of the job task components were considered crucial to the job performance of a certified financial planner. Ninety-eight of the 99 knowledge areas were also rated as crucial. (References, the survey instruments and statistical  breakdowns of the data collected are appended.) (MN)",

As a first step in designing the project, a study was conducted to assess the nature and extent of alcohol consumption and drug use by the students. Students (N=247) completed a 10-page questionnaire addressing topics such as consumption patterns, effects of drinking, change in drinking habits since entering college, student perceptions of their parents' attitudes toward their drinking, drug use, and problems associated with drug use. A minority of students reported using drugs, while a majority reported being consumers of alcohol. The results showed that students varied in their drug and alcohol use from abstainers to heavy users. They also differed in their  reasons for using these substances, the contexts in which they use them, and the effects they experienced as a result of their use. It is recommended that the university consider various approaches to address diverse populations and to establish procedures designed to prevent substance abuse problems and provide assistance to those for whom alcohol/drug use is a problem. Nine steps completed in the university's Alcohol and Drug Project are listed, eight recommendations for similar efforts at other universities are suggested, and recommendations for efforts at the study university are appended.

Various programs were offered to over 7,000 students in grades three through nine. Four programs were delivered to students by regular classroom teachers and two programs were offered as elective courses. These six programs did not address the topic of substance abuse, focusing instead on factors believed to underlie substance abuse (self-esteem and school attitudes). The seventh program was a drug education course which taught students relevant competencies and provided information about the consequences of drug use. Thirteen studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of the individual programs as well as the cumulative  effects of several programs delivered to students over a 2- to 3-year period. The results revealed that the drug education course had some positive effects on students' drug knowledge and drug involvement, and their perceptions of peers' attitudes toward drugs and drug use. These effects occurred primarily for girls, and they did not replicate across studies. None of the other programs was found to be effective. The results of these studies question the value of \"generic\" approaches to substance abuse prevention. This report describes the strategies and discusses the designs, results, and implications of the various studies. Reports on the individual studies are listed in the appendix. (NB)",

When adjustments for comparability with population age parameters were made, it appeared likely that about 3% of men and 13% of women claimed to have been raped. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 26 years of both sexes reported having been raped about five times more frequently than did adults over age 55.  Homosexuals of both sexes reported having been raped over three times more frequently than did exclusive heterosexuals. Women either reared as devout Christians or currently claiming to be devout Christians reported about three-fifths the prevalence of rape reported by irreligious subjects. Reports of rape were found to vary considerably as a function of individual and/or social psychology, sex, and age. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Traditional ideals discourage Japanese women from working outside the home. This study was conducted to explore generational differences in Japanese attitudes toward women's employment and to interpret those differences in terms of social change. Questionnaires were distributed to approximately 900 Japanese men and women. Subjects were classified as being members of either the younger generation (20-39 years of age) or the older generation (40-59 years of age). T-tests were calculated to test for differences between groups. While no significant differences were found for Japanese men, Japanese women were found to differ significantly on 6 of 11 attitude items. Compared with the younger generation, the older generation of Japanese women showed a greater tendency to believe that  they could be happy as full-time housewives; that married women should stay home to have and raise children; that maternal employment was likely to harm children's development; and that a mother should not work outside the home when there was a preschool-aged, school-aged, or teenage child in the family. The results suggest that Japanese women's, but not men's, attitudes toward women's employment are changing. To the extent that this leads to greater differences between men and women, Japanese families may experience more stress and conflict related to employment issues. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"William Menninger (1948) reported research results indicating a significant relationship in a former patient's ability to stay well and his participation in recreation. J. Bates (1963) indicated one reason patients return to psychiatric facilities was the lack of skills that center around recreation. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between leisure activity involvement of psychiatric patients and recidivism. Adult inpatients (N=100) in a short-term psychiatric unit completed the Recreation is Where You Find It questionnaire which assessed leisure involvement and yielded subscores in the areas of social interaction, creative expression, physical expression, spectator appreciation, intellectual stimulation, solitary relaxation, and a total combined score.  The relationship of the six subscores and the total score to hospital readmission were analyzed. The results revealed significant negative relationships between hospital readmission and social interaction, creative expression, physical expression, spectator appreciation, intellectual stimulation, solitary relaxation, and the total of all subscores. The findings suggest that individuals who are readmitted to psychiatric facilities have poor leisure time involvement. If the goal of a short-term psychiatric unit is to offer therapy that will decrease readmission rates, leisure education should be a part of each patient's hospital stay. (NB)",

This study focused on the nature of change in early adolescence and the relationship of that change to adjustment or problem behavior 4 years later. School achievement, self-image, and problem behavior were assessed for 254 adolescents who participated in a longitudinal study conducted when they were in grades six through eight. Respondents (N=154) were followed up 4 years later when they were in their last year of high school. The results revealed that achievement patterns in early adolescence significantly predicted 12th grade achievement. The developmental pattern of  school achievement in early adolescence appeared to be more important than actual achievement level, at one point in time. The early adolescent achievement patterns, and achievement levels, were modestly related to self-image, both concurrently and longitudinally. Conventional problem behavior in 12th grade was unrelated to achievement or to self-image, either in early adolescence or concurrently at 12th grade. The results suggest that patterns of change during early adolescence in important behaviors such as school achievement have enduring relationships to subsequent behavior. (NB)",

Other research suggests that many indicators of well-being increase over the course of adolescence as well. This study investigated affective development during adolescence and examined the relationship of gender, normative developmental changes in early adolescence, and parental relationships to affective development patterns. Subjects were 254 sixth graders who participated in a longitudinal study through eighth grade. A subsample of students were involved in a follow-up study in their senior year of high school. Depressive affect was measured in several ways throughout the years of the research. The results revealed that, in early adolescence, there were usually no  significant sex differences in self-image or depression. By grade 12 however, boys reported more positive feelings than did girls. High associations were found among several measures of depression and well-being in the last year of high school. Girls were much more likely than boys to report depressed mood by grade 12, suggesting that gender becomes a more potent organizer of depressed mood over adolescence. Regardless of gender, subjects who were distressed throughout early adolescence were much more likely to report poorer self-images by grade 12. This finding suggests that poor mood in early adolescence is not transient but rather quite predictive of later depressive mood. (NB)",

A survey on control attributions was administered to 1,902 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 20 in Switzerland. The survey included a separate questionnaire designed to provide six measures of perceived quality of life. Subjects were instructed to imagine a concrete situation of an indicated kind and then to answer 12 questions. This process was repeated for a total of nine issues in the personal, interpersonal, and societal domains. The results revealed that subjects were most bothered by the future working place and personality development issues and least bothered by the issue of public youth projects. Money was the only issue  that was more important to male adolescents than to females. Most adolescents reported feeling that they had control or participated in the control over the selected issues. As expected, general life satisfaction depended heavily on the feeling of control. This was found to be especially true for the issues of personal appearance, personality development, and friendship. Having no control over issues within the societal domain did not significantly affect the general satisfaction. (NB)",

Findings showed that most students in the corrective reading program, the reading skills center  program, the corrective mathematics programs, and the English as a second language program made statistically significant and educationally meaningful mean gains. Students' mean scores on the Behavior Checklist decreased by 10.8 raw-score points, indicating a statistically significant improvement in behavior.

This study examined the effects of a willingness to self-disclose, predicted to be more characteristic of women than of men, on one's vulnerability to symptoms of depression in response to various life stresses. Data were obtained from 408 men and 493 women who completed the Psychiatric Evaluation Research Instrument Depression Scale, a three-item measure of life stress, a four-item measure of the availability of social support, and a cluster of five items measuring the subject's tendency to self-disclose. The findings revealed that females reported significantly higher levels of depression than did males, while sex differences in the reporting  of levels of life strain were found to be small and nonsignificant. Men and women were found to differ in their perceptions of the availability of social supports. While the findings provide support for the hypothesis that the willingness to trust and confide in others in times of difficulty places women at a reduced risk of experiencing a depression in response to life stresses, they also highlight the importance of distinguishing between symptoms suggestive of a clinical syndrome and more delimited forms of distress that may have little to do with poor mental health, namely feelings of sadness.

The GAO originally examined six legislative proposals introduced into the first session of the 100th Congress, then eventually focused on H.R. 2470 and S. 1127, two bills expected to form the basic structure for the Medicare coverage that the full Congress will consider. The GAO also looked at the aspects of long-term care in S. 454. Following the review, the GAO concluded that H.R. 2470 and S. 1127 would add to the benefits available to the elderly, but that some of the elderly would still be at risk  for substantial out-of-pocket health care expenses, especially for long-term care, even if the bills are enacted. This report contains: (1) a statement of the GAO objectives, scope, and methodology used in the review; (2) a review and comparison of H.R. 2470 and S. 1127 against the current Medicare program with respect to benefits to enrollees, their costs, and the program's financing mechanisms; (3) a discussion of important issues that may still need attention; and (4) a synthesis of the lessons learned from the operation of state-financed insurance programs for catastrophic illness that the Congress might consider in the development of a federal program.

Measurements were made in classes selected at random from 11 volunteer schools in South Carolina. Three types of correlational studies were undertaken: (1) peripheral temperature was residualized for extraneous variation associated with both ambient temperature and time of day, conceptualized as a point on the circadian thermal cycle; (2) the corrected peripheral temperature was tested in hypotheses on groups which were presumed to vary in average school stress; and (3) common variables used in describing schools were correlated with corrected peripheral temperature to identify those  variables that were associated with school stress. A strong school effect was found in the variation in corrected peripheral temperature, and it was shown to increase as student experience in the school grew. Certain curricula, noted for their difficulty, were found to influence peripheral temperature in directions suggestive of increasing stress on the learner. While this research cannot assert the validity of corrected peripheral temperature as a measure of stress, it contributes some evidence in support of construct validity.

        "description":"Training behavioral consultants in the school psychology field has emerged as a high priority, with most efforts centering on training consultants to assist teachers in solving children's academic and behavioral problems in the regular classroom. With the growing success of consultation procedures in applied settings, a corresponding need has developed for effective training of behavioral consultants to work with special education teachers whose students experience more severe academic and social problems. This project involved a preservice training program in which five school psychology graduate students were required to master such behavioral consultation skills as problem identification, problem analysis, intervention strategies, and treatment evaluation. These students then  served as consultants to five special education teachers of severely emotionally distured children. Four dimensions of the preservice training program were evaluated: (1) student acquisition of specific consultation skills; (2) teachers' implementation of intervention programs developed through the consultation process; (3) individual programs implemented with children identified as severely emotionally disturbed; and (4) the training program itself, by comparing it to a matched control sample in the public school. Implications for future training of school psychologists and resolving barriers in working with teachers in applied settings are presented. A five-page reference list is provided. (NB)",

        "description":"In an era of decreasing funding of the human services sector, it is imperative that the service sector be more effective and efficient. This study examined the outcomes of a management development intervention. Subjects (N=187) were middle managers in the helping professions. The experimental group was composed of 100 managers who voluntarily agreed to participate in a 20-hour management development seminar sponsored by a state agency. The control group was composed of 87 persons nominated by subjects in the experimental group as being similar to themselves in employment position, length of management, educational background, size of agency, and primary service goal. The seminar was conducted in a small group format and focused on the role of the manager, philosophy of  management, provision of useful feedback, and motivation. Results suggest that participants did learn about topic areas covered when compared to controls, except in the area of role of the manager, which suggests that both experimental and control subjects had some idea of their role. Data from a follow-up interview suggest that participants did make use of the skills and knowledge they gained from particpation in the seminar, although changes were of a modest nature. In summary, this study demonstrated that a management development seminar for human services managers can result in cognitive learning as well as modest on-the-job changes in behavior, affect, and cognitions.

A proper understanding of the right to autonomy, while essential to understanding why suicide is not always to be prevented, also serves to elucidate further the notion of rational suicide itself. Second-level autonomies, including free action, authenticity, effective deliberation, and reflection on moral values, determine the extent of first-level autonomy. A free act is intentional and voluntary. Authenticity involves consistency of action with values, interests, attitudes, disposition, and metaphysical worldview. Effective  deliberation involves the weighing of alternatives and their consequences, followed by decision. Moral reflection involves choice of values. When the above criteria are satisfied, a person is autonomous and his suicide, if it should occur, is rational. (Author/ABL)",

Waxman and James J. Florio and Senators Paul Simon, Daniel K. Inouye, Albert Gore, Jr., and Jay D. Rockefeller. Four different estimates of medical malpractice and general liability profitability are provided using different assumptions about reserve adequacies and discounting. These estimates show that over the 11-year period from 1975 to 1985 the medical malpractice line incurred losses when the reserved were valued at their full estimated payout, but was profitable when the reserves were discounted to present values. It was further found that the general liability line was profitable  over this 11-year period under all but one of the estimating assumptions. In that estimate, it was assumed that the reserved were not discounted to present values and that they were 20 percent deficient. The report concludes that despite incurring substantial underwriting lossses over the period from 1976 through 1985 the property/casualty insurance industry has more than offset those aggregate losses with investment gains. The report estimates the industry had an $81 billion profit during this period but notes that the industry estimates profit at $54 billion.

        "description":"The most general explanation of the impact of positive and negative affect on prosocial behavior has been based on the notion that prosocial responses are self-reinforcing. Accordingly, people who are feeling good are inclined to help others in order to maintain their pleasant affect, whereas those who are feeling badly are likely to help in order to alleviate their negative moods. An alternative formulation, the Dual Process model of mood, suggests that positive mood produces an expansive orientation, increasing interest in social and other activities while negative mood produced an egocentric orientation, increasing personal instrumental concerns. This experiment tested the Dual Process model to explore the effects of induced positive, negative, and neutral moods on helping,  under conditions of high or low social inducement, with a helping task having positive or negative interest valence. A 3 (Mood Manipulation) x 2 (Task Valence) x 2 (Social Inducement) experimental design was used to test effects of mood on helping. Subjects (N=120) were college students in a General Psychology course at a large southeastern university. Positive mood was found to increase helping primarily under conditions of high social inducement, which had minimal impact on negative and neutral mood subjects. Negative mood, by contrast, increased helping when the task had a positive interest valence, which had little effect for positive and neutral subjects. (Author/ABL)",

This analysis explored two state programs which exemplify different payment options: Michigan, which pays clients' informal caregivers, and Illinois, which generally pays agencies to provide services. It asked how different payment policies affect clients, specifically exploring program structure and financing which shape provider and client preferences, well-being, and assessment of care quality. Comparatively, Illinois' approach favors professionalism, high cost/quality, documentation, and an orientation toward medical and physical need. It has experienced high worker turnover and less regard for caregiver-client relationships. Michigan's approach favors  informality, casual accountability, long term stability of helping relationships, and respect for client preferences and autonomy. Both approaches offer important client benefits, but state precedents and incentives to administering agencies have shaped their overall direction. The recent rapid growth of the home care industry in Illinois could proscribe a fuller range of provider options. Greater flexibility is recommended in considering states' payment. (Author)",

        "description":"Responding to the high dropout rate in Providence, Rhode Island, public schools, community agencies, businesses, and teachers and administrators from the public schools joined together to form the Providence Dropout Prevention Collaborative. This document summarizes the study research, prevention plan, and implementation. The first chapter describes the city of Providence. The second chapter provides a profile of the characteristics of a typical at-risk student developed by examining the records of 250 recent dropouts and interviewing 100 dropouts and at-risk students. Policies and structures of the school system that work against at-risk students are examined in the third chapter. Funding for changes in the discipline system, its handling of low-achieving students, and  increasing student counseling services are recommended. The fourth chapter lists and assesses the resources available to meet at-risk students' needs, noting that academic support services were well-represented; personal, emotional, health, and legal services were not. A resource directory organized according to nine types of services is provided in this chapter. The goals of the Collaborative's plan for reducing the dropout rate and providing opportunities for students to complete secondary school are discussed in chapter five. Three strategic interventions are described: (1) continuation and expansion of the Providence Dropout Prevention Collaborative; (2) creation of Providence's Community-Based Case Management Dropout Prevention Program; and (3) improvement of the Providence School  Department's student data collection system. The sixth chapter describes the structure, functions, and staffing of the Collaborative's Plan. Appendices include goals and objectives of the New Ford Foundation Proposal to continue and expand the Collaborative; budgets for the three interventions for 1988-1989; subcommittee reports (including at-risk and droput interviews); and a list of the membership of the Collaborative.

However, minimal research has been focused on self-presentational behavior during adolescence. This study was designed to determine whether the internalization of a public self-presentation varied with identity status. Late adolescent undergraduate students (N=124) who were pretested on identity status and sociability participated in a self-presentation experiment. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of six conditions involving three types of presentations: face-to-face, written questionnaire, or anonymous--crosscut by positive or negative impression conditions. Results indicated  that subjects internalized positive presentations and resisted internalizing negative ones. Results further indicated that subjects with varying identity statuses exhibited differences in susceptibility, resistance, and reactions to encounters. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"This study examined the effects of victim gender and type of crime on college students' attributions of responsibility to the victim for the crime. Male (N=48) and female (N=48) undergraduates responded to one of four experimental vignettes depicting either a rape or a robbery committed by a male stranger against either a male or female victim. After reading the vignettes, students made judgments concerning the victim, the crime, and the assailant. Results indicated that, compared to males, female victims of rape and robbery were perceived as more likely to have encouraged their assault and were attributed more responsibility for their victimization. Robbery victims were seen as more likely to have encouraged the crime than were rape victims, but were not attributed greater  responsibility for victimization. Rape was judged to be a more serious and traumatic crime for the victim than was robbery. Students held more negative personal feelings toward, and assigned longer sentences to, rapists than robbers. Male and female students differed in their perceptions of rape and robbery, and of assailants. Females viewed both crimes as more serious, were more certain of the assailant's guilt, and attributed greater responsibility to the assailant than did males. Results suggest that victim gender and type of crime may influence the degree to which victims are held responsible for their victimization. (Author/NB)",

Much less work has been done on generational differences in personality development. This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the Test of Behavioral Rigidity administered to more than 3,000 subjects over the age range from 22 to 84 years. Data were analyzed from the behavioral flexibility, attitudinal flexibility, and social responsibility questionnaire scales, as well as from performance score measures indexing associational flexibility, instructional set flexibility, copying speed, and associational speed. Data on these scales were obtained for five samples examined 7 years apart (1956, 1963, 1970, 1977, and 1984). Within  cohort data are available over 7, 14, 21, and 28 years respectively, allowing direct longitudinal estimates. These data permit analyses of cohort differences and rate of change within cohort over as long as 28 years. Results of the analyses confirm the presence of substantial generational differences, with generally only limited change over time within cohorts. The data suggest that there has been a substantial positive development toward more flexible personality styles, behaviors, and attitudes in successive generations over the past 70 years.

As a first step, a statewide survey was conducted to examine drug use and attitudes about use among secondary school students in the state's public schools. Data were gathered on use of alcohol, nicotine, marijuana and hashish, cocaine and crack, hallucinogens, stimulants, depressants, and inhalants. This report presents findings from the survey in the areas of: (1) lifetime prevalence of selected drugs by grade grouping and drug use in the last 30 days; (2) descriptions of the most used drugs (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana); (3) drug use by sex; (4) drug use by race; and (5) prevalence  of drug use by urban and rural residence. Drug use in North Carolina is compared with drug use nationally as measured by the National Senior Survey. Also reported are student ratings of reasons not to use drugs and student information about drugs, including where students receive drug information, whom they would contact if they had a drinking or drug problem, and their first choice of school personnel they would talk to if they had a problem with alcohol or drugs. A summary of key findings is provided, plans for future surveys are discussed, and a map of North Carolina educational regions is given. Seventeen figures are included. (NB)",

It presents five questions about smokeless tobacco use and provides answers to the questions developed by a consensus development conference on health implications of smokeless tobacco use convened by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Dental Research, and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research. Questions addressed include: (1) what are the current trends in the use of smokeless tobacco in the United States; (2) does the use of smokeless tobacco increase the risk of oral or other cancers; (3) does the use of smokeless tobacco increase the risk of peridontal disease or other oral and health  problems; (4) what are the behavioral consequences of smokeless tobacco use; and (5) what issues regarding the health consequences of smokeless tobacco use require further research? The report notes that the human evidence that use of snuff causes cancer of the mouth is strong, while data are insufficient to come to any conclusions regarding the relationship of smokeless tobacco use to cancers at other sites. It concludes that use of smokeless tobacco is one of a number of health-endangering behaviors which frequently coincide, raising the potential for long-term and serious consequences. (NB)",

Most were identified at the first aid department of the Padua general hospital. Individuals who committed successful suicides were much older than attempters. Many of the cases who committed suicide were married and  were retired or housewives, with a primary school level of education. There was a five-to-four ratio of males to females among successful suicides, whereas the ratio in cases of attempted suicide was six females to every four males. Suicides were committed mainly by hanging, using firearms, and drowning. Among the attempted suicides, 72.6% used overdoses of drugs. Comparison of the data obtained in Padua with the data supplied by the Italian Statistics Institute suggests that the Statistics Institute data is unreliable and without any useful scientific foundation. It appears likely that the real number of suicides could be twice that indicated by official reports. (NB)",

        "description":"Attitudes about suicide were examined among older adults in Padua, Italy and were compared to attitudes of younger subjects. Elderly subjects (N=246) consisted of 122 adults living in residential homes, 73 medical inpatients of a geriatric hospital, and 51 depressed inpatients with primary affective disorders. Younger subjects (N=263) consisted of 27 high school students, 100 university freshmen, 70 blue collar workers, and 66 inpatients of the general hospital. All subjects completed the Suicide Attitude Questionnaire. The results revealed a statistically significant difference between the overall populations of elderly and younger subjects, indicating a much lower attitude to suicide among the elderly than among younger subjects. A significantly higher attitude to suicide was  found among the depressed inpatients than among medical inpatients. Higher scores were generally observed among older women than among older men. As a hypothetical suicidal method, the elderly subjects preferred drugs, gas, and jumping. The literature reveals that suicide methods chosen by the elderly who do attempt suicide--other than drugs--are hanging and drowning. This finding suggests that the elderly subjects studied here were oriented toward the &quot;softer&quot; means of suicide because overall they were not at high risk for suicide. (NB)",

Student achievement was examined at three points: spring 1983 (pretest), spring 1984 (posttest), and spring 1985 (sustained effects test), using the California Achievement Test (CAT) at all three points. Data were available for 15,541 students who were in grades 3 through 7 in 1983-84. Findings indicated that average reading scores increased during the year of Chapter 1 service and also during the year following the  end of program participation. Initial gains were greatest for younger students. For all but grade 3, which showed the largest increase, gains during the follow-up year were uniform. A comparison of the achievement of students who continued in Chapter 1 during the 1984-85 school year with those who did not showed that students who remained eligible for Chapter 1 services had slightly lower pre-test scores and showed little or no gains during the year of program participation. However, during the first year of Chapter 1 service they showed considerable gains.

In September 1986, 410 teachers and 298 principals completed a questionnaire which asked for comparisons between how primary students were currently spending their instructional time, how they spent instructional time in the past, and how they would spend instructional time in an ideal instructional day. Other questions concerned the opportunity to learn to read, satisfaction with students' achievement, and ability to meet individual needs. Results indicated no  statistically significant differences among teachers' and principals' reports of past, current, and ideal use of instructional time for reading. However, both teachers and principals expressed higher satisfaction under past and ideal use of instructional time than under current use.

But just how reading and writing are intertwined in the learning process has not been clearly defined. This study investigated the progress of the writing and reading of 18 children in an inner-city school in order to identify common strategies and to compare their use across the tasks as they approximate writing and reading behaviors through kindergarten and grade 1. Within an environment conducive to language learning the children were asked to read and write in any way they could. The findings showed that children initially explored the mechanics of written  language in their strategies in the reading of storybooks. But in the context of storybook reading they developed composing strategies which later appeared in their writing. In other words, writing and reading supported each other with a transfer of strategies occurring in both directions.

On three successive days the teachers read three different types of books--a narrative, an expository text, and a picture-phrase book--to their classes during a videotaped session. Immediately after the story was read, each preselected child was taken from the classroom individually and asked to tell about the book he or she had just heard. First, the children were given a blank piece of paper and pencil and asked to write anything that they could  remember about the book. Then, probe questions were asked, and finally, the children were asked to read, or &quot;pretend-read,&quot; as much of the book as they could. Results indicated that children were strongly affected by the type of book read to them, showing better performance on all measures with the picture-phrase book. Children's reading was moderately correlated with their writing, but probe recall of texts was not correlated with either reading or writing.

        "description":"Because the mass marketing of educational support services through franchised reading clinics is growing on a daily basis, both reading specialists and reading supervisors need to become aware of the growth of this industry and of its implications for the educational system. Primary forces in the franchising movement, Sylvan Learning Corporation, the American Learning Corporation, and the Huntington Learning Centers have grown by offering a safe, guaranteed product. For example, Sylvan Learning Corporation claims that children will gain a full year in achievement levels after a 36-hour, small group tutorial experience. The success of these three companies is caused by combining successful business practices with a marketplace demand for educational services, but their success,  coupled with a lack of state regulation, provides a potential for unethical dealings in both business and education. Reading specialists have a direct role in checking the growth of hucksters in the reading clinic field. Parents should be referred to clinics that are staffed by individuals who meet the qualifications specified in &quot;Guidelines for the Specialized Preparation of Reading Professionals.&quot; Only clinics operating under the profession's ethical standards described by the International Reading Association or the College Reading Association should be recommended. In addition, effective monitoring of reading franchises can be undertaken at the state level.

        "description":"In the past, phonics instruction has done little to lessen the difficulties that many poor readers have with decoding words quickly and accurately enough to construct meaning from text. Based on an analysis of the research literature in decoding and a four-year cycle of program development, a new program was created for teaching decoding to poor readers of average or above average intelligence in grades 1 through 8. Approximately 275 Benchmark School students have received instruction using this program. The program guides students to become aware of patterns and consistencies in language and to apply a decoding process of using what they have learned about words to decode words they do not know. It is a teacher directed, supplemental program to be taught to a whole class for  approximately 15 to 20 minutes a day and is intended to be used in conjunction with a basal reader or trade book program. The program features a multisensory approach, strong emphasis on vocabulary and language development, and a direct teaching model. Goals of the program include teaching students to use known words to decode unknown words, to discriminate structural components of words, to see how language is organized, to be flexible in pronouncing words, and to demonstrate automaticity in decoding--all as foundation blocks for the meaning-making process. Preliminary evidence suggests that the program has been successful in improving students' decoding skills. (Thirty-three references are attached.) (Author/ARH)",

In the first experiment, 1,116 college students read a 1,760-word passage on human sexuality with headings either present or absent. An analysis of the scores on a multiple-choice retention test revealed that the only significant facilitative effect of the headings was in the answering of main-idea retention test questions by subjects with high pre-existing knowledge about the topic, as assessed by a pretest. In the second experiment, 94 college students read a 4,840-word passage on organization in memory with headings either present or absent. In this experiment, those subjects who were  enrolled in a college course on human memory were defined as the high pre-existing knowledge subjects. The pattern of significant findings was the same as that reported for the first experiment. Thus, the results suggest that headings facilitate recognition memory for main-idea information by activating relevant prior knowledge. (Seventeen references and two tables of data are appended.

Chapter one describes the school improvement campaign called &quot;Schoolwatch,&quot; the problems in the Chicago public schools, and the components of effective schools. Chapter two analyzes what it means to know how to read; it explains how reading is tested and evaluated in the Chicago public schools and what the scores mean. It also shows how to look at reading scores for the school system as a whole, for one's own school, and for a child. Chapter three describes in depth the ten ingredients that researchers have identified as  crucial for an effective school. For each one, a &quot;report card&quot; gives parents specific things to look for to help them decide whether their school measures up and where there is room for improvement. Ingredient ten, where bilingual education is discussed, has been expanded to reflect recent research and opinions on the subject. Chapter four describes how decisions made &quot;downtown&quot; affect the way that children learn (or do not learn) to read in Chicago, and tells what changes are needed so that the school system's bureaucracy serves the local school. Finally, chapter five tells exactly how parents and community members can work together in Chicago's &quot;Schoolwatch&quot; program to improve the schools. (ARH)",

Divided into 12 chapters, the book begins with a chapter providing a general overview of reading instruction, including the debate between the perception of reading as decoding or comprehension, and other current concerns in teaching reading. The second chapter discusses different activities for encouraging early readers, such as questioning techniques and rereading favorite books. In the third chapter, diverse classifications of early learning processes are presented, with discussions focusing on incremental learning, the criterion of difficulty, and Albert North Whitehead's theory of necessary antecedents. Other chapters consist of:  (1) &quot;When Are Children Ready to Read?&quot; (2) &quot;How Computers Help Children Learn to Read&quot;; (3) &quot;The Language Experience Approach to Teaching Reading&quot;; (4) &quot;Phonics and Reading Instruction&quot;; (5) &quot;Linguistics and Reading Instruction&quot;; (6) &quot;Learning from Misreadings: A Look at Miscue Analysis&quot;; (7) &quot;Dialects and Early Reading Instruction&quot;; (8) &quot;The Pros and Cons of Basal Readers&quot;; and (9) &quot;Reading's Past and Future.&quot; (Twenty pages of footnotes are appended.)

Over 7,000 words from elementary school textbooks have been organized into 61 instructional clusters, each containing two levels of subclusters which are grouped according to closeness of semantic relationship. For each word, the authors have provided a recommended grade level, its part of speech, and a note on whether it is a basic, fundamental building block word. The list of clusters is presented in the appendix. The four chapters that precede the appendix describe vocabulary theory, procedures for forming the clusters, instructional uses of the clusters, and additional  vocabulary activities not directly tied to cluster approach. Also included in separate appendixes are (1) an alphabetized, referenced list of the words; and (2) definitions of commonly confused words such as &quot;infer&quot; and &quot;imply.&quot; (ARH)",

The first study examined the effects of teaching sixth grade students about comparison/contrast text structure. Results indicated that such instruction improved sixth grade students' text recall, summary organization, and appropriate use of key words and phrases. The second study (in which eight teachers and their students participated) introduced fifth and sixth grade students to the writing process with emphasis on: (1) audience and purpose; (2) the role of text structure knowledge in planning, drafting, and revising; and (3) audience, purpose, and text  structure knowledge. This study presented students with &quot;think-sheets&quot; to prompt students through the writing process, and results indicated that students in these programs made significant gains in their free writing skills. The third study reported on the participation of an experienced fifth grade teacher in the previous studies, and noted that the teacher internalized the teaching strategies presented in the program. Finally, the fourth study involved an extensive descriptive examination of the writing curriculum used in special education classrooms and with special education students mainstreamed into regular classrooms. Based on the results of these studies, a revised expository writing program was developed. (Samples of students' writings and one figure are included, and sample  planning, organizing, editing, and revising work sheets, one footnote and 49 references are appended.) (MM)",

There are three inter-related and overlapping ways that readers make coherence. Intratextuality, the notion that readers perceive a text as coherent if it is unified with a single recognizable subject (or closely related subjects), is derived from script-based semantics--the contextual semantic theory of Victor Raskin. A second way of making coherence, extratextuality, occurs when a text refers to or is centered around an identifiable cultural, philosophical, cognitive, social, historical, or political assumption, and readers of the text who are familiar with that assumption are able to  perceive the text's coherence in ways that unfamiliar readers may not. Finally, intertextuality--relations between one representation and another rather than between a textual imitation and a nontextual one--has several coherence-contributing aspects, including: (1) the text is a recognizable genre; (2) the text is thematically like other texts; (3) the text makes the reader think of other texts; and (4) the text derives from, implies familiarity with, or parodies other texts. These intertextual links, like the intratextual and extratextual links, assume the reader's participation in creating coherence. (Thirteen references are appended.) (MM)",

An alternative and expanded model of cultural literacy, GODDESS (Gender or Diversity Designed to Show Significance), could be a new way to teach the dominant white male culture about women, minorities, the old and the poor. Cultural literacy should be expressed in non-sexist language and should respect women's different value system and mode of relating to others. Teachers must be sensitive to the ways in which women's approach to both writing and reading differs from that of men. Published criticism prior to the 1970s reveals established  parameters for appropriate readings of literature which require the adoption of male values. It is imperative that the literary canon be expanded to include high quality literature by women and minorities, including works in various nonfiction genres. &quot;What Every American Needs to Know&quot; should refer not to Hirsch's white male canon but to an expanded list arrived at through a commitment to engendering cultural literacy.

Phonetic spelling is used in writing to encourage students to use the range of words available in their vocabularies, and daily writing occurs without negative feedback. Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) scores were used from the 1986-87 school year for 86 kindergarten and 130 first grade students in the program, and 155 kindergarten and 152 first grade students in control groups. Writing  samples were collected from the treatment and control groups as indicators of student writing ability during the fall and spring. Teacher attitudes and experiences relative to the program were also collected and evaluated using a teacher-survey instrument. Findings indicated that kindergarten students who participated in the Writing To Read program made significant gains in reading and language achievement, and students in the program scored significantly higher on reading achievement than did the comparison group. First grade students in the program did not differ significantly from comparison group reading achievement scores. (Twenty-two tables are included, and 13 references are appended.) (MM)",

Results indicated that students, teachers, and principals were supportive of instructional efforts in writing.

However, while there can be no doubt that Smith greatly truncated the five classical arts of rhetoric (invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery) by reducing his concerns largely to style and arrangement, he did not reject a second major rhetorical tradition that has its roots in Aristotelian rhetoric. This tradition is called the communication tradition and views discourse as the creation of an interaction among a writer, a reader, and a subject (the &quot;communication triangle&quot;). Smith based much of his rhetorical theory on the &quot;communication triangle&quot; and by doing so developed a full theory of style that has its roots deep in the classical tradition.  Smith viewed stylistic effect as the interaction among the three elements of the &quot;communication triangle.&quot; For Smith, an effective style uses language that (1) effectively conveys the sentiments and thoughts of the author; (2) achieves the desired effects on the audience; and (3) corresponds to the subject under discussion. When language accomplishes all three goals, according to Smith, then the style possesses beauty and effectiveness, which he naturally emphasized. But at the same time Smith also addressed traditional rhetorical concerns. (MS)",

        "description":"Although the complexities of the concept of audience in nonacademic settings are gradually being recognized, audience analysis continues to be viewed primarily as a cognitive, problem-solving activity. Grounded in decontextualizing research--such as protocol analysis--this approach to audience assumes that, to inform appropriate writing choices, the writer can and should determine values, needs, goals, and attitudes of a primary audience. However, recent ethnographic research suggests that, although the writer does make substantive analyses, the writer's main concept of audience is predetermined by contextual constraints. The writer makes choices primarily based on an organization's collective view of the writer-reader relationship, which the writer understands at a tacit level  through everyday experience. Audience analysis is thus a social process shaped by both situational and organizational constraints. Students should be equipped with ethnographers' strategies in order to understand their audiences by understanding those around them, thereby viewing their writing in a social context.

        "description":"What is meant by saying that reality is socially constructed or that writing is a social process must be thought about carefully. Advocates of a social constructivist view of writing have been able to challenge dominant cognitivist and expressionist paradigms surprisingly quickly. However, such a swift victory needs to be examined. When tested in the classroom, attempts at collaborative writing often fail. In addition, the appropriateness of the dominant metaphor of the writing as a social process position, &quot;community,&quot; is questionable. Writing is not just cooperation and identification, but also competition and division, not just a reflection of reality, but also a deflection. Preoccupation with epistemological arguments for writing as a social process have served as protection  in a number of ways, and may have been part of the continuing effort to legitimize composition studies. It is questionable whether the privileging of epistemology, and the related downplaying of politics, ideology, and psychology, has constituted a substantial change. Finally, the current advocacy of writing as a social process may have permitted the escape of a potentially painful awareness of the writing teacher's role in the educational system--not wanting to recognize in these theories that teaching is work, as is learning for students.

        "description":"In defining an audience, writers make guesses about the mutual knowledge shared between writer and readers, and thus send cues to readers that exclude them from the audience for a specific discourse. Often writers assume that readers possess more knowledge than they actually do, and so make it impossible for readers to function within the world of the discourse. This phenomenon is most obvious in government and legal documents, and can border on the criminal, because needy people are denied full access to government services and to the courts because of a lack of understanding of the discourse. Yet it is not only disadvantaged or poorly-educated readers who are excluded from writings. Text inaccessibility seems to be part of a wider trend, affecting all sectors of our society,  including the scholarly and professional communities. As a consequence of incomprehensible texts, more and more decision-making is relegated to experts. Teachers of writing must make students aware that there are many potential audiences for almost any piece of writing, and the way in which they exploit mutual knowledge will determine which readers will be brought into their texts and which readers will be excluded. One suggested way to do this is to have students write the &quot;same essay&quot; for more than one audience. (ARH)",

Three hypotheses were developed about how knowledge and strategy might influence writing performance: (1) independence (predicts that knowledge and strategy will independently improve writing performance); (2) compensation (contends that content or knowledge and tactics or strategy are two paths leading to the same destination); and (3) enabling (postulates that knowledge and strategy interact, but not in a compensatory manner). College students were given writing problems (adapted from the Law School Admissions Test) that called for analytic thinking and informative writing. Judges then rated the documents for content  quality and style quality. The conclusions of the analysis showed that: the results best conform to the independence hypothesis; outlining, but not clustering, is an effective prewriting strategy; and outlining improved the quality of written documents and enhanced the fluency of language production during drafting.

These theories about the power of social forces in writing are clearly needed in a field that has focused primarily on the writer as an individual, but they do pose some problems. First, they offer a view of academic discourse that is oddly lacking in conflict or change. Second, they present that discourse as almost wholly foreign to many students, raising questions not only about their chances of ever learning to use such an alien  tongue, but of why they should do so in the first place. Finally, they tend to polarize talk about writing. One of the most pressing tasks for writing theory is to form what Williams calls a &quot;positive opposing&quot; term for discourse community, one that will allow us to view writers as social individuals--as persons who are not only acted upon by the social discourses of which they are part, but who can act to resist and change the demands of those discourses as well.

The primary task of the literary critic is to understand and explain what is experienced and then to interpret works of literature in relation to all the literature the student knows. To help children grow as critics of literature it is necessary to broaden their experiences by presenting them with the best from among a wide variety of children's literature, old and new. Also, guidance must be given to young critics to encourage insights into the significance of individual literary works and to assist them toward an understanding of literature as a coherent body of interrelated works, relating both to each other and to popular media forms such as advertisements, pop songs, comics, and the situation  comedies and police shows of television. To stimulate wider reading, interest inventories with open-ended questions can be used. Word-of-mouth, personal testimonies, book talks, Readers' Theater presentations, displays, talks by authors, and planned discussions are all successful techniques in helping enlarge children's experience with fine books. The unit approach to literary study is an effective way to help young critics grow in making connections among literary works. Experience, through study examined and clarified, leads to a conception of literature as a coherent structure, to an understanding of how imagination works in the creation of art in words.

The study investigated three salient characteristics that influenced the overall success of argumentative spots (otherwise known as arg-spots) which include issue, image, and visibility. Twenty-nine arg-spots were analyzed in light of these characteristics, and were broken down into four geographic regions--north, south, midwest, and west. Twelve variables, including primary topic issue, use of endorsement, and  symbolic artifacts were evaluated for the arg-spots from each region, and similarities and distinctions across geo-regions were noted. Analysis revealed that from the perspective of the political campaign as an argumentative conflict made manifest through the mediated debate, the arg-spot played an important role in presenting selected and well-crafted arguments to the voting public. Findings suggests that arg-spots represent a positive step in re-establishing a healthy mediated deliberative diet for the voting public. (Ten tables are included, and 36 footnotes are appended.)

The commercials were viewed in the context of two variables: (1) ads were studied from a regional perspective; and (2) spots were examined to determine if incumbent candidate advantages were manifested in different commercial patterns and strategies between incumbent and challenger candidates. Other factors evaluated included content theme,  topic issue, source of endorsement or attack, use of symbolic artifacts, stylistic characteristics, social and location context, and actual length of the spot. Analysis revealed that attack and argument ads were the two most prevalent spot categories, suggesting a trend toward greater usage of negative spots in political campaigns.

Effective communication skills are a key to the accomplishment of any industrial task and to the development of the subordinate/supervisor relationship. However, because of the complexity of communication, it is difficult to know which aspects of communication should be targeted for supervisory training to enhance effectiveness. The method most often used in industrial skills training is behavior modeling, which involves four key elements: the model, a checklist for understanding, practice, and feedback. The model can be a demonstration or example of the skill to be learned. A checklist for understanding provides the conceptual framework of what are the  necessary checkpoints for success, why these checkpoints are important, and the performance requirements for optimal results. Practice is an essential key element for skill acquisition. As part of that practice, feedback about the practice is necessary so that the performers know when they have done well and how their performance could be improved. For example, Front Line Leadership, a program which employs behavior modeling, consists of two modules: &quot;Getting Good Information from Others&quot; (focused on non-verbal communication behavior) and &quot;Getting Your Ideas Across&quot; (focused on message preparation).

During a three month period, three of the classes were observed once, and one class was observed three times. Student responses to various gender-related topics (male inexpressiveness, non-verbal communication and power, gender differences in friendship, and language as a man-made system) were recorded and analyzed, following a phenomenological method of description, reduction, and interpretation. An observational approach was used in  order to focus on the dynamics specific to the classroom setting. All student expressions were sorted into groups consisting of similar expressions, which were then organized into 13 thematic categories or clusters. Finally, these categories were ordered along a continuum ranging from complete denial to a relative understanding of women's oppression. The essence of each category is stated in a sentence from the students' perspective, and a brief summary paragraph elaborates on the category's theme. (Twenty-three references are appended.) (MM)",

        "description":"Although most speech communication writers view coercion as negative, coercion is a legitimate form of influence used as often in open societies--and more often within organizations--as persuasion. Where coercion is the influence means of habit or choice, a clear conception of its nature will increase its effectiveness; and a clear conception will also help point to places where coercion should be constrained or supplanted by other forms of influence. A review and analysis of some of the influence forms presented by James T. Tedeschi and his colleagues in their studies of social influence processes can help develop the legitimacy and prevalence of coercion. Many interactions are coercive and resource-based, where the power to withhold or give tangible and intangible  resources--expressed by implicit and explicit threats or promises--is the core of the relationship. Instead of expending time and energy in construction of euphemistic interpretations of the world, it is important to examine the realities, and recognize the nature of these coercive systems.

        "description":"Organizational studies traditionally take the position that the more people involved in group decision making the more ideas will be generated. Recent studies demonstrate that people have a tendency to &quot;loaf&quot; in group situations and thus decrease the level of effort exerted by individual group members. This paper first reviews the literature on social loafing and then analyzes the results of a longitudinal study which used brainstorming tasks. Subjects, 31 students in a small group communication course at a large midwestern university, were given individual and group brainstorming activities to complete 4 times during an 8-week period. Results indicated that subjects contributed fewer ideas in a group brainstorming activity in comparison to an individual effort on a similar task.  Also, social loafing appears to occur over an extended period of time. Findings show that social loafing does appear in communication contexts and thus suggest the communicative relevance of social loafing for organizational research.

Recent articles by Dwight Conquergood and Kristin Langellier provide the basis for merging ethnography, oral history and social action projects. Narratives from a 1984 farm crisis project illustrate this concept of oral history performance as social action. Performance of these farm women's narratives served as (1) therapeutic communication for the farm women; (2) a means of informing the public about the reasons for farmers' failures; (3) a platform for requesting legislative assistance; (4) an expression of personal grief over the depression or suicide of their husbands; (5) an assertion of group spirit; (6) a warning to other  farmers; and (7) an escape from reality. It is crucial for the interpreter of oral narratives performed in social contexts to attend to nonverbal and vocal clues of the narrators so the original context and interpretation are maintained in the scripted version.

        "description":"A survey was conducted to examine the role of peace education within existing speech communication programs and to describe that role both in terms of curricular and research priorities. Respondents, 113 department Chairs out of a total of 578 on the Speech Communication Association's list of institutions offering degrees in communication, answered questions concerning (1) educator attitudes about the relationship between the discipline of speech communication and peace issues; (2) the inclusion of peace issues in collegiate programs and curricula; and (3) research priorities for examining peace issues from a communication perspective. The results indicated a significant range from zero peace communication curricular activity to full-fledged interdisciplinary majors. While most  speech communication educators responding to the survey perceived a logical relationship between peace communication and their discipline, very few were actually teaching peace communication theory, history, or strategies. Those who are &quot;teaching peace&quot; are typically doing so within the scope of upper level courses in interpersonal and small group communication. There seems to be a perception that such instruction is inappropriate for or of little interest to the general student population. Although there is increasing activity in the broad area of peace studies in the university setting, for the most part that activity is under the leadership of some department or program other than speech communication.

        "description":"To address the lack of research focusing on naturally occurring groups within an organizational context, a study examined the selection process and criteria that individuals use when allowed to self-select members for task groups. Subjects, 248 students enrolled in a basic communication course at a midwestern university, self-selected themselves into 47 groups (three to seven members each) as part of a class assignment. After participating in various acquaintance activities, subjects formed groups by signing their names on the blackboard with others they wanted to join in a group. The students then gave written responses to an open-ended question asking about the selection process and characteristics involved in choosing their fellow group members. Results showed that physical  attractiveness was not a central issue when task groups were being formed, and that individuals used active communication processes and relied on communication characteristics or characteristics that could be inferred from interaction in making group member selection. Responses also indicated that subjects looked for characteristics that defined an individual's willingness to work, ability to get along with others, openness to communicate, and similarities of interest and personality.

Four biology and life science teachers participated in the first year of two year-long studies (the second is in progress). All of the teachers were interns or student teachers in a fifth-year teacher education program, and taught at the 9-12 grade level in San Francisco Bay area public high schools. The relative subject-matter knowledge of the teachers on 15 biological topics was determined using quantitative and qualitative discourse analysis. Results revealed that when teachers did not have a strong understanding of the topic they were teaching, they were likely  to use frequent low cognitive-level questions to control classroom conversation, and student participation was minimal. In high teacher-knowledge classes, teachers asked fewer questions and student participation and questioning was high. (Figures of the study's conceptual framework, the middle strand of the conceptual framework (speech activities level), the rate of low cognitive-level teacher questioning, the frequency of student speech acts, student questioning rate, ratio of teacher to student questions, and class time spent on other activities before class discussion are included, and 19 references are appended.)

To find out more about the perceptions of mainstreamed children a study examined interpersonal needs and expectations among students in grades 6 to 8. The method used was to apply Q Methodology to the study of the patterned perceptions of special children who have been mainstreamed into a required middle school class. Approximately 500 students (including those labeled &quot;handicapped&quot;) in required computer literacy classes from a midwestern county school, were tested to determine  their communication self-concept. Only 340 of the tests were completed correctly and usable for data analysis. Five significant types of students emerged: (1) The Capable; (2) The Ego; (3) The Outcast; (4) The Reticent; and (5) The Okay Kid. Results suggest that Q is a useful technique for examining the interrelationships among interpersonal needs of adolescents; that a majority of the special students appeared to function successfully in a regular classroom; and that reticence is the major problem of one-third of the special students.

For a comparison between perceptual attitudes between politically active women and other groups of people, questionnaire and interview survey techniques were used to study attitudes of three groups: 28 members of the Acadiana Women's Political Caucus, 28 Optimist Club members (male), and 170 college students and residents of a Louisiana parish. The survey was followed by the development of a Q-Sort to measure attitudes about women in politics. For the Q-Sort, the college students were asked two questions concerning the requirements of  political involvement and the type of encouragement they would need to become involved. Perceptions of the major inhibiting factors preventing Southern women from being politically active differ among the survey groups in this study. More traditional values, lower educational levels, and less employment outside the home appear to be the key explanations for the lower political participation by Southern women. The results of this study suggest a need for a public education program to increase political participation by Southern women.

A study analyzed &quot;The Transformers&quot; television program (a new robotic cartoon consisting of a mixture of violence, technology, space travel, and galactic adventure) specifically by examining the language, violence, and characters of the cartoon. The program was precipitated by two major forces: superhero cartoons and toy manufacture. The innovative toys, which can be manipulated to create various figures, contributed to the immense popularity of the program. To obtain information on children's perceptions of &quot;The Transformers&quot; television shows, 34 youngsters were asked to complete a  questionnaire on the program and participate in an oral discussion about the cartoons, which they generally liked. At the same time, to analyze the program content, 37 college students rated &quot;The Transformers&quot; as to violence, characters, and language. Results indicated serious problems with the animated robotic adventure that included: inappropriate technical language, a complexity of evil lines, and a harsh way to portray a good moral. Although Transformer toys have given children a creative and modern puzzle form, the extension of &quot;The Transformers&quot; into a television series has negative associations for children.

        "description":"Based on the premise that effective teaching depends on successful communication, this booklet discusses the nonverbal dimension of communication. The booklet contends that humans use nonverbal communications for the following reasons: (1) words have limitations; (2) nonverbal signals are powerful; (3) nonverbal messages are likely to be more genuine; (4) nonverbal signals can express feelings too disturbing to state; and (5) a separate communication channel is necessary to help send complex messages. The booklet argues that teachers should be aware of nonverbal communication in the classroom to become better receivers of student messages and to gain the ability to send students positive signals that reinforce learning, and at the same time become more adept at avoiding negative  signals that stifle learning. Several significant research highlights are presented and various areas of nonverbal expression are treated, including facial expressions; eyes; vocal intonation; touching; body postures and movements; dress; and use of space. The conclusion of the booklet maintains that if effective communication is to be achieved in today's schools, it must be as an open process where teachers and students possess the ability to send and receive messages accurately.

Among these factors are the following: (1) teacher participation; (2) collegiality among staff members; (3) shared belief that change can occur; (4) leadership by the principal; (5) sharing of power and vision among staff; (6) a program that is congruent with the vision, and developed from a coherent set of ideas and beliefs about education; and (7) some early successes in implementing the program. Common problems during implementation include those with the environment, with people, and with the program. When principals attack problems with a repertoire of coping strategies, including a variety of vigorous managing and  capacity-building interventions, there is greater likelihood that the school improvement program will be integrated into the school's overall operation. These case studies illustrate particular ways that secondary school principals can involve other staff members in the reform effort. (MLF)",

        "description":"This report examines the school superintendency in British Columbia (Canada) by focusing on superintendents' perceptions of their role's emerging skill requirements. From 1979 through June 1987, the transition from provincial employment to employment by local boards of school trustees resulted in the departure of nearly 52 percent of superintendents. To clarify the issues, interviews were conducted in 1987 with 42 superintendents who had held the position since 1980. The respondents believed that changes in the character of boards, in employment relationships, in societal and political parameters, and in the demands on superintendents have created different skill requirements. The superintendents stressed the essential nature of such skills as leadership initiative, communication  and team-building abilities, and political statesmanship. The changing leadership demands appear to have contributed to the departure of some from the superintendency. To assess the issues further, information from informants in eight provinces was compared with the circumstances in British Columbia. In all the provinces, superintendents are employed locally. New Brunswick and British Columbia had similar experiences with turnover and the politicization of school boards. The report concludes that the future of the superintendency depends largely upon the board/superintendent employment relationship and its joint ability to develop comprehensive guidelines for recruitment, selection, and employment. Two reference pages and eight tables of data conclude the report. (CJH)",

Alternative placement addresses a variety of needs for many groups, including juvenile offenders and students of diverse ethnic and social backgrounds, who may simply require the individualized attention such schools provide. The report provides a list of alternative school classifications with the following major headings: (1) campus programs; (2) schools within schools; (3) intervention; (4)  community programs; (5) correctional schools; and (6) separate facility schools. A resource guide briefly describes 20 successful alternative programs throughout the nation. The report concludes with a series of recommendations emphasizing that school district administrators must be committed to working cooperatively with community agencies and supportive of a comprehensive system of public school options.

        "description":"The skills, understandings, and attitudes necessary for an effective instructional supervisor were identified in the literature (using, for the most part, those materials written since 1975). Twenty-six elements were identified and clustered into six areas for a self-evaluation instrument that can give supervisors a means to describe and analyze their work in instructional supervision. The supervisor or principal selects, on a 5-point scale, responses to describe personal behavior on each of the 26 elements of instructional supervision. On the analysis sheet the instructional supervisor identifies weak areas and writes a plan with specific steps to take in order to improve those areas. The outline of elements of the supervisory process names each of the items on the  self-evaluation form and lists suggested resources for that item. A supervisor evaluation form and suggestions for its use are included to obtain feedback from the supervisees. The self-evaluation instrument can be used as the basis for a program for training supervisors as well as a means of support and self-assessment during their first year in a supervisory position. It can also be used in the planning of staff development programs for principals and supervisors. A bibliography listing 105 resources is appended. (MLF)",

        "description":"A research study of the implementation of &quot;good ideas&quot; in 14 schools came to the conclusion that differences in school organization and climate cause differences in the success of school improvement. Specific aspects of organization and climate in these schools, called factors of school context, are the following: resources, incentives, linkages, priorities, factions, turnover, current practices, and prior projects. During this 3-year study, the research team found that when these 8 factors were favorable, implementation of &quot;good ideas&quot; seemed to go smoothly and the intended improvements took hold. This publication is intended to help school staff concerned about improvement apply the results of this research. Organized into three sections, the report (1) presents a process for  analyzing how a particular school stands with respect to the eight factors; (2) illustrates how schools can vary on the eight factors by providing specific examples of practices and conditions; and (3) describes how school leaders used the analysis of a school's context to guide their introduction of an improvement. The report concludes with general recommendations regarding how each factor can be addressed. (MLF)",

A deliberate effort is made to prescribe and predict elements essential for a responsive and dynamic futuristic curriculum, without necessarily describing the specific details of such a curriculum. Although predicting the shape of education in the future is risky, it is contended that unless modern man adapts his thinking and his behavior to the realities of the present and plans for the future, he is most likely to repeat endlessly the mistakes of the past. Most of the ideas suggested for the future of the curriculum in Nigeria are accordingly offered as possible guides for Nigeria's new system of education. Topics covered include the concept of responsiveness to technological and social  developments, the concept of balance in the curriculum of the future, teachers in the curriculum of the future, creativity, and decentralization.

The introductory section is a general discussion of the political implications of language policies in multilingual nations and the problems resulting from attempts to institute instruction in the mother tongue. The design of the ensuing study is based on two major assumptions: (1) that educational policy and school texts are good indicators of societal &quot;core&quot; values and future orientations; and (2) that salient policy features and values will likely be  translated into school texts. Content analysis is used to examine data from four sets of instructional contexts: Kenya/English, Kenya/Swahili, Tanzania/English, and Tanzania/Swahili. The findings are organized around the following broad categories: daily life, Africanization, bases for legitimating knowledge, self-help, egalitarianism, value of education, work emphasis, national integration, rural development, African traditions, and cooperative behavior. The subsequent discussion focuses on cross-national contexts (that is, English medium and Swahili medium perspectives irrespective of national boundaries) and within-nation contexts (relating to salient policy features in each country.

The first section of this review charts the development of the STS field since the late 1960s. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s a group of writers, called STS prophets, focused attention upon the effects of science and technology on our society. The ideas of the STS prophets were assimilated in university interdisciplinary courses that urged a \"social process\" view of science and technology. The second section accounts for the extension of STS into K-12 education in the period of the \"excellence reports\" and the attempt to rebuild science education. The primary goal that has emerged for STS education is  frequently spoken of as \"scientific and technological literacy.\" The third section considers how this form of literacy has been tied to participation as a citizen in our democratic society. Because of their lack of STS education, citizens are unable to understand, or to participate in an informed way regarding, many issues on the public agenda. To counter this crisis, established forms or other possible forms of citizen participation should be selected for special emphasis in education. A number of suggestions are summarized. The final section considers the practicability of educational reforms proposed by STS educators. Appended are 63 notes. (MLF)",

It defines four categories of policy instruments and hypothesizes how each will operate in addressing different policy problems in different political and organizational contexts. Subsequent research will assess recent educational reform policies. The conceptual framework includes four generic classes of instruments: (1) mandates, rules governing the action of individuals and agencies, intended to produce compliance; (2) inducements, the transfer of money to individuals or agencies in return for certain actions; (3) capacity-building, the transfer of money for the purpose of investment in material, intellectual, or human resources; and (4)  system-changing, the transfer of official authority among individuals and agencies to alter the system by which public goods and services are delivered. The document defines and describes the four classes of policy instruments, identifies the factors that shape the choice of one instrument over another, and outlines a research agenda for testing this analytical framework in the assessment of educational reform policies.

The tabulations and figures are prefaced by a description of the survey methodology, indicating what the limitations are on the data and briefly describing sampling variation. The mail sample survey collected information on a nationally representative sample of 2,801 public schools and 10,650 teachers. The purpose of this report is to make preliminary data available from the survey; it is only an excerpt of what will be available on the full public use data tape. School information includes data on enrollment, staffing, minority enrollment, use of aides and volunteers, use of computers, and incentive programs for teachers. Teacher information includes data on training, experience,  age, racial-ethnic affiliation, teaching salary, working hours, and additional employment. The tables conclude with a copy of the questionnaires used to collect the data. The report does not include interpretation or highlights of findings, nor does it provide cross references to other data. (MLF)",

        "description":"This paper examines relationships between measures of educational interest group strength, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National Education Association (NEA); characteristics of state education agencies (SEA); and selected indicators of educational policy centralization. The more specific purpose of this study is the discovery of patterns of both interest group (AFT and NEA) and SEA influences on educational policy choices in different regions and political culture types. State educational policy centralization or decentralization is operationalized in terms of relative state or local responsibilities in two program areas: textbook selection and student testing for grade promotion or graduation (competency-based education). The findings suggest that the  internal and external policymaking distinctions are useful for understanding the correlates of state educational centralization policies. More specifically, there is an association between interest group or SEA resources and policy choices for the population of states and generally within regions. High levels of bureaucratic resources tend to be associated with policy centralization; conversely, strong interest group resources tend to be associated with policy decentralization. Appended are 5 tables, 21 notes, a 23-item bibliography, and 2 appendixes that show the data sources. (Author/MLF)",

School districts and individual schools across tha nation are formulating crisis management plans and in some states they have become mandatory. Basic procedures drawn from plans adopted by schools include the following: (1) designate in advance the person and a substitute who will be in charge if a crisis occurs; (2) identify a potential crisis management team; (3) maintain a regularly updated record of persons and organizations that are to be contacted immediately; (4) designate a space that will become the crisis management team's headquarters; (5) at regular intervals review the overall plan; (6) arrange for staff inservice training; (7)  assign a recordkeeper; and (8) designate a person to provide information to the media. Review the plan with the school staff and with parents, sharing with them the responsibility for developing the best possible strategies.

        "description":"In order to facilitate the transition to a multiracial community and to meet the prevailing desire for academic excellence, magnet schools have arisen in urban areas throughout the country. These schools meet racial quotas through voluntary enrollment and open access, promote integration through cooperative learning practices, emphasize personal goals rather than competition, and facilitate individualized instruction. As a result, they improve minority achievement without hurting white achievement, and challenge the assumption that standardization is the most equitable system. Magnet schools are criticized, however, for undermining the concept of fairness through standardization and for tokenism, since they draw only the best students and leave most minority students worse off  than before. Magnet schools must therefore appear attractive but not elitist by appealing to interest rather than ability, and diverse but not second-rate by providing sound criteria and objectives. To avoid tokenism, a broad array of magnets should be established so that all children have the real option to attend schools of their choice. (TE)",

Effects of the procedure on the rate and accuracy of task performance were recorded. Results indicated that mean on-task behavior of all four subjects increased an average of 74 percent over baseline performance, and generalized from the training to the workshop setting. A two-week followup check indicated that on-task behavior maintained over time. Supplemental  recording indicated that rate of production did not increase substantially for any subject. (Author/JW)",

For each disability, related terminology is defined, emergency procedures noted, and specific suggestions offered for adapting the tour to meet  the needs of the handicapping condition. For example, suggestions for adapting a tour for visually handicapped persons explore the following topics: evaluating the accessibility of the facility, introducing oneself, starting with a verbal orientation, offering assistance, speaking clearly and with enthusiasm, choosing an uncluttered route, including touchables in the tour, and using supplemental aids. A resource section presents a chart on epilepsy and how to assist a seizure victim, a list of agencies serving disabled individuals, and a selected bibliography. (JW)",

The study found that: (1) A dynamic interaction is needed among the referral, assessment, placement, and instruction processes. (2) Time-on-task data should study the amount of the school day that finds students academically engaged; 43% of each typical school hour was found to be available for instruction, of which 77% was on task. (3) A direct correlation exists between time-on-task and the positive nature of teacher-to-pupil interactions. (4) In-class distractors such as talking out, out-of-seat, and general non-compliance can be remarkably decreased  by using very simple, low-intensity, remedial strategies. (5) There is little correlation between teacher characteristics and student learning; teaching skills are a more important factor in student learning and are incorporated into teaching methods through five phases of instruction: knowledge of the underlying theory, demonstration, coaching, appropriate practice, and feedback. The paper concludes that teachers today employ technologies and strategies that are 50 to 75 years old and ignore the research database on behavior management and instructional technology that would enable them to proceed scientifically rather than intuitively.

The cultural familial retarded have no advocates to spontaneously champion their cause as other handicapping conditions do. This segment of the population is growing at a rate three to four times as fast as the general population. A three-point plan is proposed: (1) Government must become advocates of the cultural familial retarded, and must recognize them as individuals who are permanently locked in the grip of poverty and  intellectual inability. (2) Society must come to grips with the uncomfortable topic of birth control in situations where the procreators are intellectually incapable of making rational decisions which are in their best interests and in the best interest of society. (3) New focus should be given to counseling the cultural familial retarded to help them fend better in society and to help them delay, control, and terminate the procreative process to achieve a more manageable family situation.

VECTOR sought to increase the employability of severely to mildly mentally handicapped students (aged 18-21) in transition from school to work in the greater Minneapolis, Minnesota, area. VECTOR's objectives were to develop a long-range planning mechanism; incorporate a vocational counseling program; develop social/interpersonal skills, independent living skills, and occupational skills; enhance the attitudinal development of handicapped students; and develop support services to ensure the successful transition from school to work. During the 3-year grant period (October, 1984 through September, 1987), VECTOR provided training and employment to  72 students, 44 of whom egressed to post-school activity. The students' classroom activities were geared primarily to employability skills, independent community functioning, vocational training, and/or community-based employment. The project's effectiveness was evaluated based on student outcomes, consumer responses, and outside evaluations. The evaluation process found that student participation in secondary vocational programs steadily increased and a pool of employers was developed to provide meaningful worksites for VECTOR students. Improvements needed to be made in systematizing parental involvement. The volume concludes with an annotated bibliography of curricular materials and forms for student intake interviews and vocational skills assessment. (JDD)",

A systems theory perspective forms the theoretical base for the design of the longitudinal studies, influencing site selection, choice of instrumentation, and plans for analysis. Detailed results of four feasibility studies are reported, including one which investigated effects of two levels of parent participation with their handicapped preschool-aged children's special education programs. Aspects of the study regarding recruitment and assignment of subjects to groups, data collection,  instrumentation, treatment verification, and attrition were examined as part of the feasibility activities. The remaining feasibility studies examined the effectiveness of three early intervention pilot projects in Illinois, each differing in various aspects of program design and service delivery. The baseline report also describes sites which are proposed as collaborators in the longitudinal research, and summarizes additional information concerning instrumentation, design/analysis issues, cost analysis procedures, and treatment verification procedures which emerged as a result of the feasibility studies. A final section reports on project management over the course of the initial 9-month period. (JW)",

Videotape, interview, participant observation, and artifact data were collected to construct the descriptions. The study attempted to answer the following questions: (1) Do young children identified as highly original by the \"Starkweather Originality Test\" also demonstrate originality in play and products? (2) Are common patterns of play choice demonstrated by highly original children? (3) Were there similar identifiable creative characteristics among the four children? (4) Were there characteristics of social competence evident among the children? (5) What strategies did each child use to satisfy social  goals? (6) Were there common patterns of peer social behavior among the children? Each of the children is described in terms of demographic characteristics, creative characteristics, and social characteristics. Conclusions indicate that all four children had high levels of inner imagination, that each of them had a speciality area for creative expression, and that all four children were independent, persistent, fluent with ideas, and expressively elaborate. Socially, all four had different levels of social competence and used different patterns of social behavior. (DB)",

This is intended to help the reader watch the maturing process from the somewhat limited understanding of the first interviewee, through the adolescent years when normal sibling strife can be exacerbated by the presence of a handicap, to the young adult years when siblings have built lives outside the family home and look back upon their childhood relationships with a more removed perspective. The comments of the  siblings vary widely, but among the topics covered are relationships with parents, school-related experiences, reactions of their friends to their siblings' problems, level of understanding they had as a child about the handicaps involved, the responsibilities they bore for the care of their sibling while growing up, and their concerns about future plans and longterm care for their sibling.

Twelve specific activities were coded (8 academic; 4 nonacademic); activities were coded every 10 seconds; and each student was observed on a whole-day basis. Results showed that few significant differences existed among the student categories in the amount of time  allocated to various activities--the act of differential classification did not result in quantitative differences in the ways in which students spent their time in school. Compared to time spent in regular classes, a greater proportion of the time that students spent in special education classes was allocated to academic instruction. Mentally retarded students in self-contained classes spent significantly less time on academic instruction than mentally retarded students in resource rooms or regular education classes. (JDD)",

For those students who received instruction in both mainstream and special education settings, comparisons of the tasks used for different handicap categories revealed that a greater proportion of time was devoted to teacher tasks with  emotionally/behaviorally disturbed students as compared to other categories of students. Significantly larger proportions of time were spent on paper tasks and significantly smaller proportions of time on fetch/put away tasks in the special education setting compared to the mainstream setting.

Management responses (such as raising hand, looking for materials, and waiting) accounted for a significant portion of the student's day, and inappropriate responses accounted for about 30  minutes. Over the entire school day, there were no significant differences in the array of responses made by the different categories of students. In general, students in special education settings spent more time actively engaged in academic responses than mainstreamed students did; inappropriate and management responses were higher in mainstream settings.

        "description":"Current state guidelines for student-teacher ratios and/or caseloads in special education programs serving mildly handicapped students (including learning disabled, mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, and speech impaired) were examined and compared with pupil-teacher ratios reported by the U.S. Department of Education. The study defined \"mildly handicapped students\" as \"students who receive educational services partially in regular education and partially in special education.\" Guidelines that could be reviewed were provided by 39 of the 50 states; others either did not respond (N=2) or did not have state-level written guidelines (N=9). Extreme variability was found in state recommended ratios, in how ratios are defined, and in how they are presented. Significant  discrepancies were found between ratios presented by individual special education guidelines and those represented in the federal report. Implications of these results for current special education practice are discussed. Tables are used to present data on methods used by states to determine caseloads and student-teacher ratios and on the comparison between state and federally reported statistics. An appendix provides a state-by-state breakdown of the defining characteristics used to determine ratios. (Author/VW)",

The review on instructional psychology covers the following areas: definitions of instruction, principles of learning, models of the teaching-learning process (J. Lembo and M. Dembo), theories of instruction (the Gagne Briggs theory, mastery learning theory, prescriptive theory, R. Case's theory, and E.Z. Rothkopf's theory), and instructional stages. The Models of School Learning discussion stresses how instructional effectiveness is viewed in each of the following six models of school learning: John Carrol's model of school learning, Benjamin Bloom's mastery learning  model, A. Harnischfeger and D. Wiley's model, the Model of Classroom Processes used in the Instructional Dimensions Study, the Model of Classroom Instruction of the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study, and N.L. Karweit's Dynamic Model of Classroom Learning. Similarities between the models include: emphasis on learning as a complex amalgamation of factors and emphasis on the role of time. Differences include focusing on different levels (the individual student, the classroom, or both) of instruction and different emphases on the relationship of critical variables of instruction.

Effective teacher characteristics are outlined for such areas as classroom management, instructional organization, lesson presentation, teacher beliefs, and  teacher practices. Generalizations from the research on teacher decision making are discussed in six categories: the kind of information used, focus of instructional planning, use of curriculum objectives, judging the lesson implementation, use of time, and accuracy in judging student performance. Four decision-making models are considered which focus on: (1) teacher decision making, (2) supervision, (3) teacher education, and (4) instructional improvement.

It discusses the duties they perform in the classroom and the reasons for low parental participation. The review of the literature suggests the following conclusions. Parent and senior citizen volunteers and paraprofessionals can be a valuable, reliable resource in the special education classroom, though there is confusion about their specific roles and their need for training. Volunteers need to be better informed regarding their responsibilities under the law and need to be better trained for this role. Teachers also need more training on how to use volunteers and paraprofessionals effectively  and on techniques of parent counseling and conferring to ensure better communication. More cooperation is needed among educational agencies in providing sufficient training and employment opportunities for special education volunteers and paraprofessionals. References are included.

The structural elements of 30 exemplary programs in six states are described and an optimal organizational model is presented. Among 20 identified exemplary practices are limiting the number of handicapped students in each mainstream class and providing multiple exit points with specific occupational outcomes. Successive chapters focus on the interdisciplinary approach (integrating the expertise of special educators and vocational educators), characteristics of classroom instruction, optimal classroom arrangements, and  components of the overall system of education for employment (professional development incentives, vocational assessment and placement, prevocational instruction, work experience, transition services, support services, interprofessional communication, and administrative support). Implications for state and federal policy are detailed in the areas of funding, technical assistance, and evaluation. Among observations in a concluding chapter is that local education agencies must take the major responsibility for improving the ability of vocational education programs to serve mildly handicapped students.

The study evaluated use of the computer with 27 students who spent one class session a week in the Computer Aided Writing Project. Comparison of pre-testing (September) and post-testing (May) showed mixed results. Further analysis of results indicated a distinction between active/expressive tests or tests couched in the context of  a full paragraph, and passive/receptive tests or tests of tasks isolated from context. All the improvements students made were in the active, paragraph-size tasks: organizing specifics into paragraph form, proofreading, writing/grammar, and speaking/grammar. Students' performance on tasks isolated from paragraph context (crossing out unrelated specifics in lists, categorizing/outlining items in lists) and the receptive tests of reading/grammar and listening/grammar showed no improvement and in some cases showed some loss. Teacher observations tended to be positive. (DB)",

Evaluation of three evaluative studies by the program's originators claiming to support ALEM effectiveness resulted in the following conclusions: (1) it is unknown whether ALEM can be implemented in classroom settings differing in aims, needs, and contextual characteristics; (2) it is probably not true that hypothesized patterns of classroom process occur when ALEM dimensions are in place; and (3) it is unclear whether implementation of the ALEM leads to important improvement in student academic  performance. It is concluded that currently there is insufficient cause to view ALEM as a successful, large-scale, full-time mainstreaming program.

This paper presents a rationale for prereferral assessment and intervention focused on the increasing numbers of mildly handicapped students enrolled in special education, the increasing frequency of teacher referrals for student evaluation, and evidence that teacher referrals may be arbitrary and precipitous. Traditional educational assessment is compared to prereferral assessment and intervention. Then the basic dimensions of the MAT are explained, including behavioral consultation in four stages (problem identification, problem analysis, plan implementation, and problem evaluation) and the use of&quot;written scripts&quot; by consultants to ensure all important information is communicated during formal meetings. During year 1 the project was implemented in four inner-city middle schools with 10 school based consultants. Limited success during the first year led to changes in year 2 including requiring the use of contingency contracts and data based monitoring procedures. During year 3 elementary guidance counselors in 20 schools are being trained in the MAT program. Appended are a sample student-teacher contract; a sample &quot;script&quot;; instructions for teacher and student monitoring with an interval recording system; and instructions for the product inspection approach to teacher and student monitoring.

The model utilized three stages of community arts involvement: awareness (orientation of students and parents to existing opportunities); exploration (selecting from a variety of arts programs those which students wished to become further involved in); and integration (in-depth participation through ongoing involvement in a selected community arts group). The program was implemented in Washington, D.C. and Dayton, Ohio. Among evaluation  findings were that each student participated in an average of eight events during the project's federal funding; that both students and parents rated the program positively; and that transportation problems were the largest impediment to participation. Recommendations included allowing at least 4 months for student/participant/volunteer recruitment; establishing collaborative relationships with existing community arts groups at the earliest possible time; conducting more workshops with arts groups on a continuous time schedule; and expanding activities to include more traditional recreation, especially sports. Over half the document consists of appendixes which provide data tables from the interim report; data tables from the end-of-project analysis; data collection instruments and  procedures; and project related letters.
