        "description":"Focusing on eliminating the disparity of literacy between low income, ethnically or culturally diverse populations and their more advantaged counterparts, this paper describes policies and procedures on how to ensure that all children in Washington State schools attain the highest levels of literacy possible. After some background information, the first section examines theoretical and research perspectives of reading and includes discussion of background and vocabulary knowledge, comprehension, fluency, reading and motivation, considering reading materials, and reading as a developmental process. The second section considers practices that support reading development and includes research on practices and balanced instruction for beginning readers. The third section discusses  reading for fourth grade and beyond and describes issues concerning teaching comprehension, metacognition, teaching strategies, vocabulary learning, and the reading/writing connection. The last section deals with children at risk and discusses beginning reading, phonemic awareness, studies that focus on comprehension, and sociocultural issues.

        "description":"This study investigated improvement in reading/language arts test performance by non-transient learners in three accelerated schools. The sample included sixth-grade students who remained in the same accelerated school for at least four years. The third and fifth grade readers' scores on Louisiana's criterion-referenced test were used in this investigation. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship of several variables to improvement in reading. A three-step sequential analysis was used to assess how various factors influenced reading improvement (i.e., whether students had a higher percentile ranking in sixth grade than in third grade). The first step included individual background variables (i.e., gender, retention, age, and base test scores). The second added  the school environment variables. The third added the curriculum and instruction variables. Each step improved the fit of the model. Further, the differences between schools evident in step two were no longer significant in the third step, indicating curriculum and instructional practices explained the effects of school environments.

        "description":"This research-based comprehensive literacy plan for grades K-3 for Idaho states that reading programs during the first 3 years should be designed so that adequate instructional time is devoted to the teaching of phonemic awareness skills, phonics skills, the development of spelling and orthographic skills, the development of reading fluency and automaticity, and the development of reading comprehension strategies. The plan further states that each of these components of reading instruction should be taught in an integrated context with ample practice provided in reading familiar material. The plan is divided into separate sections for each grade, each component of which is outlined clearly in divisions listing skills, teaching interventions, and assessment. The Kindergarten  section has the following parts: (1) Oral Language and Listening Skills; (2) Reading Skills: Sound, Symbol, and Structure Awareness, Comprehension; and (3) Vocabulary, Spelling Writing. The first, second, and third grade sections have the same parts with the addition in each section of a part on Phonics, Decoding, Word Attack, and Comprehension. The plan concludes with a glossary of relevant terms and sections on suggested assessment materials, references, reading textbook selection, and bibliography of phonological awareness resources.

It presents a decade of NAEP reading data in a clear, easy-to-understand format that enables state policymakers to monitor educational progress over time; whether their students are performing as well as others; and the extent to which all groups of students in their state are achieving at high levels. It awards gold stars to seven states and one U.S. territory that increased the percentage of 4th graders who met  the National Educational Goals Panel's performance standard in reading during the 1990s: Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, and the Virgin Islands. The report also recognizes the top three states in 4th grade reading (Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts), and in 8th grade reading (Connecticut, Maine, and Montana). It recognizes four states and one city that made greater than expected gains in reading achievement between grades 4 and 8: Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Louisiana, and New York. After a foreword, a statement of Goal 3 and objectives, data highlights, and an introduction, the report presents two pages of information for each of the following: the United States, each state, the District of Columbia, and five  U.S. territories.

        "description":"By looking at narratively-rich poems both as individual poems and as part of much broader social narratives, students become extremely excited, and their papers become far more complex in exploring gender, ethnicity, and social class. An instructor tries to help students enter into the life of the poems, to enter into a conversation the poet has begun. The ability to talk and listen to each other, to know how to tell a story and to listen to the stories of others is becoming more and more an essential part of literacy in people's daily lives. The instructor has students translate a poem literally into a text of prose so they compare their lives to the lives inside the text and embrace the life and story inside. He stresses a more process-based pedagogy instead of a more formal  one, and it has become clear to him that this pedagogical practice helps students understand issues surrounding literature, literacy, and diversity.

        "description":"The backlash against public access to information, coupled with misinterpretations of the relationship between fair use and the First Amendment, not only threaten educators' ability to access information for educational purposes, but create roadblocks for the public's constitutionally supported right to participate in democratic dialogue. The result is that all educators, particularly those who teach in networked classrooms, could face much greater restrictions to the information that provides the basis for learning simply because they choose the Internet as a means of access. The 1976 Copyright Act established that the &quot;fair use&quot; of copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research is not an infringement of copyright.  The First Amendment's free speech protections ensure the free flow of information, but the copyright clause provides a limited yet exclusive statutory monopoly to authors, which allows them to control access to information. Fair use is the political core of the right to teach in its grant of access to intellectual work that forms the basis for the creation of new knowledge. The interdependent nature of fair use and free speech makes strong fair use protections necessary to a healthy First Amendment. (SC)",

For English speaking students, needing to belong to ingroups, and the casual attitude of American society both contribute to students' decisions (or inabilities) to use an appropriate level of language for writing. Students who have grown up speaking and listening to Black English Vernacular, Spanglish (a hybrid of English and Spanish), or other languages often have difficulty writing in Standard American English. Teaching students various levels of writing from casual to informal to formal, a writing teacher developed a lesson to help students determine the appropriate level  to use for their audience when writing academic papers. Hearing, analyzing, and presenting a fairy tale in three different writing levels, students realize the importance of writing levels to their audience. (Contains five references.) (SC)",

        "description":"This paper contends that anyone who teaches English or who wants to write or publish must be sensitive to the issue of gender equity in language, whether in the use of police officers, not policemen, flight attendants, not stewardesses, or the exclusive use of the masculine pronoun, which was the standard years ago. Writers can avoid gender bias by making a gender-neutral noun plural which allows for the use of the plural pronoun which is gender neutral. The use of &quot;they&quot; or &quot;their&quot; as singular pronouns which refer to an indefinite pronoun is becoming widespread and acceptable, even though indefinite pronouns are singular. Some grammarians suggest writers revise any sentence which uses a gender-specific pronoun, in such a way that the pronoun is eliminated altogether. English  educators must decide if, in the interests of redressing a historical imbalance, they should follow President Clinton's lead--he recently used the feminine pronoun alone in his State of the Union speech--and advocate the use of the feminine pronoun alone in reference to a gender-neutral noun.

        "description":"Dramatizations as a response activity during literature study provide a vehicle for students to use language, both verbal and nonverbal, in an educational context. A study focused on a group of five students who chose to use story dramatizations as one way to create their interpretations of the book, &quot;The Slave Dancer&quot; (Fox, 1973). The study, which explored possibilities of how these fifth-grade students, the classroom teacher, and the researcher could co-construct meaning for the novel, combined two research paradigms: action and interpretive research. Data collection was a recursive process; key sources of data were audio- and video-tapes of a small group responding to literature; field notes of classroom observations; a teacher journal and interview; photocopies, videotapes,  or student work samples; and interviews of each student who participated in the literature group. The recursive research process was one of revisiting the data, narrowing it down, making interpretations, and describing it. During their reading, journaling, and discussion of the book, the students created two drama projects for &quot;The Slave Dancer.&quot; Detailed transcripts of their interaction in the dramatizations show that the students had comprehended the novel and shared that understanding with their classmates.

        "description":"Unless questions about student performance and student retention can be answered and unless educators are proactive in finding and publicizing such information, basic writing programs cannot determine if what they are doing is working. Hard data, especially from underrepresented groups, is needed to support these programs. At Arizona State University, for example, basic writing students take the &quot;Stretch Program&quot;--it essentially stretches English 101 over two semesters, giving the basic writing students more time. The &quot;Stretch&quot; students pass English 101 at a 6% higher rate than those who take &quot;regular&quot; English 101. Other basic writing programs are collecting and distributing these same kinds of hard data. For example, semester-to-semester retention is up 11% at Southern Illinois  University (Carbondale), over 80% of their basic writing students pass the entire writing sequence at West Chester University. Placement data from Arizona State, detailed placement information from the last five fall semesters, detailed pass rate data, registration and pass rates, a graph of percentage of student population, pass rates for ENG 101-WAC 101 for the last five semesters, and pass rates for fall data are outlined, leading to several questions, especially about minority group students.

        "description":"Recent books and scholarly journals directed to English composition teachers reveal something like conceptual chaos, a Babel of mutually unintelligible academic tongues. &quot;New Professional Compositionism&quot; has taken a fundamentally wrong view of the relationship between knowledge (including theoretical knowledge) and practice. An examination of case studies of such &quot;applied&quot; scholarship leads to a &quot;reactionary&quot; view of what is left after the dust settles. Albert Kitzhaber published an influential study of college writing instruction, &quot;Themes, Theories, and Therapy,&quot; (1963) in which he opined that in the future, college English departments would no longer have to offer writing courses but could teach literature (as they had been trained) because high schools would demand more  rigorous work from their students. The fault lines of generative/transformational grammar's &quot;implications for practice&quot; clearly manifested themselves in the research of Kellogg Hunt into syntactic maturity and the subsequent curriculum projects aimed at syntactic maturity acceleration. The classroom-oriented John Mellon and Frank O'Hare developed programs of sentence-combining drills for high school students, habituating them to write longer, denser clauses. But English teachers rated Mellon's control group's less syntactically mature writing as &quot;better&quot; writing. Sidney Dobrin's &quot;Constructing Knowledges&quot; (1997) expresses enthusiasm for recent composition theory. For students, &quot;What works?&quot; is the pertinent question, not &quot;From what research findings, epistemologies, political ideologies,  and other theories should the profession derive its direction?&quot; (Contains 23 references.)

A study explored the effectiveness of using storytelling in the forms of folktales, family stories, and personal experiences to facilitate literacy learning over a six-month period. In the first three months, a class of ESL students (all Chinese) was given assignments to tell personal experiences and family stories, usually about their mother country, in class. In the second three months, a reading class  of developmentally impaired adults was instructed to tell fables. Results indicated that both groups: (1) gained confidence in speaking in a group; (2) attained greater mastery of the language; and (3) increased comprehension (exhibited by the stories retold), higher self-esteem, and more friendships through an increased ability to communicate personal values.

The paper muses on the work of Kristie Fleckenstein (who claims there is a &quot;somatic mind&quot; which moves between discursive and corporeal space) and Donna Harraway (who writes of cyborgs) and suggests that their writing is a &quot;kind of specialized performance addressed to a small--if powerful--audience.&quot; It also suggests that visualizing existence in terms of dualities such as mental/physical or public/private is problematic and asks whether these theories have any empirical validity. Empiricism is the codification of those few things that are known, although the very act of narrowing and circumscribing a  field so that it can be studied carefully limits what a person can &quot;know&quot; and distorts in some ways what will be found. An article by Trainor and Godley is discussed which is an observation of events regarding the removal of a basic writing course at an unnamed state university and the failure to remove a similar course at another state university in the same system. The paper questions whether there is a need to argue theory over practice or practice over theory. (NKA)",

        "author":["Corso, Gail S."],
        "description":"Writing teachers notice how students who succeed with their written projects often do so after they have moved to a kind of anger either with themselves or the project, with external stimuli, or with a general sense of injustice. They are stimulated by the emotion to creative problem solving, and as an effect, they may succeed at eliminating the perceived problem or injustice and overcoming the sense of injury. This type of expression of anger might lead to anti-social features in the writing--disrespect, unconventional language, threatening statements, manifestations of hate, severe sarcasm and contempt for the rights of others, and contempt for the status quo. Anger, however, can channel a writer's thoughts to creative problem solving with socially acceptable language choices  in the writing. In all cases, a response to the emotion driving the written response seems called for, and writing instructors may need to understand and consider boundaries for their roles in each of these situations that reveal a rhetorical nature of anger. A survey of 28 teachers in the 1998 summer institute of the PA Writing Project elicited identification of anger as a constructive starting point in their own personal lives and as civically responsible individuals. Pro-active manifestations of anger relate to how learners solve problems they define, remove doubts they have identified, or pursue other types of inquiry related to active learning processes.

        "description":"A team of field researchers studied exemplary language arts teachers in Dade County, Florida (a high school that is 99% minority, but with strong administrative support from the Dade County's Division of Language Arts/Reading) and examined the contexts that lead to thought-provoking learning in English classes and the professional contexts that support such learning. The Division of Language Arts/Reading is a group of administrators (all former teachers) who focus their main attention on teacher training and curriculum development. Keeping closely connected to real classroom practice and constant support and respect for the classroom teacher is the philosophy that underpins what happens in the division. Staying on the cutting edge of language arts is exemplified by attending  local, state, and national conferences, and participating in professional organizations. Staff development and curriculum materials are developed and delivered with organization and structure. Bringing in experienced, talented teachers, and actively involving them in the curriculum development process makes the curriculum more realistic and also provides a rich resource from which the Division can draw when the need arises to replace a supervisor, or add new positions.

Hudson Middle School, where Starr teaches, and the Schoonhavn district along with the support of a strong suburban community, benefits from the visionary leadership of Hope Anderson and Kim Lehrer, who were the driving forces in the area of staff development and curriculum planning in the district and in the middle school. The professional life at Hudson is enriched with an \"expectation of participation and input\" from the teachers from developing the  curriculum to district-sponsored activities to department meetings to classroom learning. Starr teacher language arts with a great deal of interaction with her colleagues. Her main goal as an educator is to learn more about engaging students in thinking about literature. The system allows an experimental environment that encourages students and teachers to take risks. She teaches language arts energetically with a focus on student interaction, lots of reading, writing, and discussion, and lots of student questions.

Chapter 1 compares holistic scores in 1984 and 1996 regarding student writing fluency in informative, persuasive, and narrative writing. Chapter 2 compares mechanics scores in 1984 and 1996 to look at overall characteristics of the papers, use of sentence types, control of sentence structure, and control of word-level and punctuation  conventions. A summary includes discussion of fluency in writing, grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and observations made from the research.

        "description":"Becoming a better teacher through active reflection is at best encouraged in graduate school, however Teaching Assistant (TA) training often focuses so intently on the &quot;how&quot; of teaching writing that it never reaches the &quot;why&quot; of teaching; TAs are left with an eclectic grab-bag of activities that they know &quot;work,&quot; although the nature and purpose of that work may be unknown. To encourage and nurture this reflective quality in new teaching assistants, there are steps a program can take. At Eastern Washington University, a smaller university, a program provides a ready-made syllabus (allowing the TAs to focus on teaching) and incorporates reflective writing (reading and writing about the teaching process.) Incorporating the Eastern (small university) model into a much larger setting  at the University of Arizona requires some adjustments to the program. A program assigning new TAs with veteran TAs (Teaching Advisors) to monitor and mentor the new TAs is a viable option for a larger university. Teaching Advisors in a larger university setting should encourage new TAs to reflect intelligently on the work they are doing. Small groups of new TAs meeting under a Teaching Advisor can discuss their teaching, and read and discuss articles, exploring the &quot;whys&quot; more than the &quot;hows&quot; of teaching. By providing an advisor and encouraging quality of reflection, a composition program is far more likely to produce great teachers in a subject that is hard to understand. (SC)",

Four hundred and eighty-five (N=485) surveys were collected from participants. Respondents ranged in age from 17-57 years old with a mean age of 24. Results indicated that: (1) 29 percent of the students had been exposed to PowerPoint in other classes, and 33 percent had given presentations using it; (2) students had a higher effect for classes using PowerPoint as a  lecture tool; (3) 69  percent of the students perceived PowerPoint as a cognitive aid; and (4) the use of the technology significantly increased the desire for Hispanic students and English-as-a-second-language students to want to see the technology used in other classes.

        "description":"A case study examined how, in one school, participation in an elementary arts integration program began with one teacher and grew until there were nine volunteers by investigating how the school culture encouraged teachers, administrative support, and theatre's effect on teachers and students. Qualitative data were collected and included observations of teacher meetings and lesson demonstrations and interviews with teachers, students, parents, principal, and the theatre specialist. Data analysis revealed school culture supported teacher change: teachers talked frequently, shared ideas and materials, and wanted to learn new teaching techniques. Teachers felt theatre improved student self-confidence, risk taking, and cooperation. Students liked drama's active learning. Despite  these findings, teacher participation disintegrated because outside support for peer mentoring and reflection was weak. Program effectiveness decreased: (1) peer mentoring was dropped; (2) no substantive discussions about theatre took place; (3) autonomy and isolation were promoted; and (4) little integration of drama and curriculum occurred. An after-school class for teachers was set up. Ten teachers took part and worked in four collegial teams. The course used drama strategies (e.g., story drama, puppetry, process drama) to promote peer mentoring and coaching. While the teachers enjoyed the class, they were most satisfied by the peer interaction. Reflections suggest that: case study results informed the planning for the class, but similar results could be achieved using educational  drama strategies and staff development literature; peer mentoring is highly effective, but difficult to arrange; an after-school class will be more effective if the instructor goes into the classroom to observe the teaching and learning process.

        "description":"This guide is intended to help public-school educators, policy makers, and others develop a school desegregation plan. The guide presents the basic features of the Controlled Choice Student-Assignment Plan, which was developed to achieve student-body diversity, provide choice regarding one's school of enrollment, and promote school improvement. The plan embraces the notion of complementarity, wherein opposites are attracted and completed by each other and thereby serve as mutual enhancements. The volume explores the value of organizing the delivery of educational services by neighborhoods and looks at alternatives to neighborhood schools. The plan is presented in four chapters. Chapter 1 examines the principles and assumptions of Controlled Choice, such as the idea that risks for  good public-school experiences and against bad public-school experiences should be shared in an equitable way. Chapter 2 describes design and implementation strategies for Controlled Choice, emphasizing the importance of a planning process that is open to everyone. Chapter 3 then turns to community organization theory, outlining the strategy of establishing a structure that can harmonize formal authority that travels from top to bottom and from bottom to top. The last chapter details how Controlled Choice worked in Boston, Massachusetts, where a Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan was initiated in 1989. (RJM)",

Each of the volumes offers an annual report of the ongoing changes in education. Volume 1 focuses on state-appropriated funds for education and per-pupil expenditures. It looks at school consolidation, greater accountability to taxpayers, stronger accreditation standards, and gains in standardized achievement tests. Volume 2 examines academic standards, enrollment figures, teachers' salaries, the basic-skills curriculum, accountability benchmarks, alternative education, character education, and community involvement. The third volume highlights the increases in state appropriations for public schools, the number of graduating high-school seniors  who took the ACT college-entrance exam in 1997, how Oklahoma's students compare to students in other southern states, the success of the Reader Leaders' program, and the rise in alternative education. The last volume describes how although state funding increased, Oklahoma's national ranking in per-pupil spending actually fell, from 47th in 1996 to 48th in 1997. It discusses the academic benchmarks set by the state, the number of students who plan on going to college, the state's academic scholars program, per-pupil expenditures, enrollment demographics, funding sources, the number of school districts, teaching standards and salaries, and alternative education.

        "description":"This publication complements the \"Education for All\" program and is intended to provide a comprehensive and operational indicator for monitoring education. As a synthetic tool, the Educational Progress Indicator (EPI) facilitates the analytical assessment and projection work of educational planners, managers, actors, and policymakers. The EPI combines three basic indicators: (1) the net enrollment ratio; (2) the functional literacy rate; and (3) the higher education attendance ratio, which is equivalent to the number of students per 100,000 inhabitants. The average of the levels of satisfaction of the three indicators provides the average aggregate level of satisfaction with regard to the EPI. Recently available data show that countries can be classified into three major groups:  countries with EPIs lower than 60 percent, mainly African countries; those with EPIs between 60 percent and 75 percent, most Asian, South American, and Central American countries; and those with EPIs between 75 percent and 90 percent, which includes the most efficient industrialized countries. This booklet outlines the need for synthesis in educational indicators and describes how the EPI was constructed. It explains the special features and uses of EPI, such as the comparability between countries in spite of differences in systems, and details the applications of EPI and the state of education of women and girls.

The first sample was a group of 30 schools whose scores had improved significantly from 1997 to 1998. The second sample was a comparison group of 10 schools that served demographically similar students and were located in the same parts of the state as the first group but whose scores had improved only slightly or not at all. The principals of the schools, or a principal's designee, were also interviewed. Findings indicate that schools that made significant gains in test scores took a proactive approach toward improvement. Principals and teachers in these schools assessed strengths and weaknesses, set a  limited number of priorities, focused on improving instruction, and took the initiative to find the help the school needed. It was also found that effective changes in teaching methods and materials were focused and schoolwide, not random and fragmented; that improving schools operate as teams; that professional development is school development; that performance pressure is positive when it leads to determination, not to fear; and that improving schools do not wait for help as they make strategic use of limited resources.

Recommendations include treating race as a process, not as a category, exploring how racial categories within schools take on meanings over time, and preparing longitudinal studies of values that are usually conflated with class.

The overview focuses on 10 strategies: (1) raise academic standards; (2) create small learning environments enabling students and teachers to work together; (3) structure learning around careers and students' interests; (4) promote student achievement by enhancing educators' professional development; (5) link students' out-of-school learning experiences to classroom learning; (6) provide counseling to encourage indepth college and career awareness; (7) reorganize the school day into  flexible, relevant segments; (8) assess students' progress by what they are capable of doing; (9) forge partnerships with two- and four-year postsecondary institutions; and (10) forge active student-support alliances involving educators, employers, parents, and communities. The report is organized by the strategies. Each section begins by defining the concept underlying the strategy and then clarifying the major reasons why the strategy is thought to work. Research studies are cited next. Each section concludes with a summary of the strategy's effectiveness.

        "description":"This book intends to make the contents of the standards in the eight liberal-arts subjects more accessible to teachers, parents, and the general public. Content standards identify what students are expected to know and be able to do and can provide a way to identify the knowledge and skills that society wants young people to possess. The volume is divided by subject matter: arts, civics, English-language arts, foreign language, geography, history, mathematics, and science. Each chapter presents an overview of what students who complete a K-12 education are expected to know. Each set of standards is introduced by a brief rationale for that subject, along with an explanation of specific features of that section's material and the way it was derived. Within each subject, content  standards are grouped according to topic area. Following each of the numbered content standards are statements called \"standard benchmarks,\" which identify specific expectations for learning within the more general expectation of the particular content standard. The benchmarks are also associated with certain grade levels, at the end of which students should be expected to have met that benchmark. The standard benchmarks are also annotated to indicate related benchmarks in other disciplines. (RJM)",

        "description":"This essay traces the history of two standards--estimation and mental calculation--devised by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). It is hoped that the history of these standards will illustrate the difficulties encountered by other proposed standards and by the standards movement as a whole. The essay provides an overview of the national standards movement, its rise in the 1980s, and the evolving standards debate. It examines the rationale for the NCTM standards, arising from the recognition that most Americans could not solve simple math problems. It describes the need for proficiency in mental calculation and the command of math facts and basic operations in making such calculations. The document explains that many states quickly followed NCTM's lead in  establishing standards, but notes that there were remarkable differences of interpretation among them. It details how California educators tried to implement the NCTM standards only to have their students perform abysmally on a national mathematics test, and how Maryland educators successfully pushed students to learn mathematical reasoning and the ability to solve novel problems. The essay recounts the politics surrounding the NCTM standards, parents' reactions to the changes, ways to measure skills in estimation and mental calculation, and other information. (RJM)",

The booklet is part of the \"Council for Basic Education Standards for Excellence in Education\" project, a multiyear effort to provide parents, educators, and the general public with a better understanding of how standards are used to evaluate and improve schooling in the United States. It examines the role of standards in the schools and why standards are important. The document emphasizes the importance of parents learning what standards are taught in their schools and becoming involved in evaluating and implementing such standards. Parent involvement is presented as a crucial element in student achievement; once parents begin to understand the world of standards and feel  more comfortable navigating it, they will push for even higher standards. The document stresses the need to provide opportunities for students to learn and to ensure that the learning environment is conducive to learning and that teachers are well-prepared and fully qualified for the job. It states that standards provide parents a point of entry into an often confusing school system and that standards derive their strength from their specificity and applicability. (RJM)",

It recounts the stories of three principals, one from an elementary school, one from  a middle school, and one from a high school, and their efforts to implement standards in their schools. Each principal's account details the difficulties in instituting standards-based education and the need for hard work, community support, and teachers' endorsement. The essays touch on participatory leadership, the establishment of goals, the need for conflict management and parental support, expectations for students, a rigorous process of assessment, schoolwide portfolio meetings, inclusive leadership, the use of academies, the importance of scheduling, and the positive changes attributed to standards.

        "description":"This paper discusses the designs and effects of emerging state-level accountability systems. It claims that in a few years' time, state-level policymakers will be faced with recognizing that a substantial number of schools in their states will have failed to progress toward academic standards at the rate their reform plans demand. The paper has three sections. The first part examines some of the theories around state-level policies and performance-based accountability systems and places emphasis on the role of rewards and sanctions in improving instruction. The second section, by drawing on examples of accountability systems in three states (Kentucky, Maryland, and Mississippi), illustrates how the problem with schools in the \"middle\" (those that are neither failing nor producing  high outcomes) is seen to emerge under different accountability policy regimes. The final section offers some possible future directions, such as differentiating and targeting policies, for thinking about incentives for continuous improvement under accountability policies. The article considers some common assumptions about school governance and education policy that have emerged in the 1980s and 1990s and that underlie accountability systems and uses these assumptions to ask questions about their effects on schools in the middle.

The program was also designed to decrease the use of out-of-school suspension by 90 school administrators in this Florida district. Some of the strategies used for the program included inservices to instruct principals, assistant principals, and deans in accurate incident reporting and alternative actions to out-of-school suspensions. The levels of success for the program were measured by the pretest and posttest of the common base of knowledge of administrators and through direct comparison of data provided by earlier tests. Discipline action reports for each of the 35 schools under consideration were used for  comparison. Results show that program objectives were met in all of the elementary and middle schools and in five of the six high schools. Eleven of the 18 elementary schools decreased their aggregate discipline rate by 1.5 percent or more; all 10 middle schools decreased their aggregate discipline rate by 8.1 percent or more; and 5 out of 6 high schools decreased their aggregate discipline rate by 9.7 percent or more. All three of the targeted schools showed a dramatic improvement in all areas. (Contains 21 appendices.) (RJM)",

In the study described here, 359 teachers in 9 restructuring secondary schools in 1 district estimated their ability to perform common teaching tasks in 4 of the courses they expected to teach in the coming school year. Results show that teacher efficacy was lower for courses outside the teacher's subject. The findings indicate that teacher efficacy is threatened when teachers move away from their home departments, either by teaching a course outside their subject or by facilitating curriculum activities that cross departmental lines. The effects of teaching outside one's area were greater than the effects of track and grade, two course characteristics  that have been linked to teacher efficacy in previous research. The study also found that teacher efficacy was influenced by teachers' leadership roles. Teachers who were expected to promote student learning across subjects had lower teacher efficacy than teachers in traditional positions of added responsibility (department heads) and teachers who were not in leadership positions. It is suggested that if reform is to succeed, reformers need to create coping structures and strategies for enabling teachers to move out of departments. (Contains 65 references and 6 tables.)

The article reports on a study that examined the effects of social promotion on students, looked at alternatives to social promotion, and investigated how teachers in a representative public school district perceive social promotion. Data were gathered from 46 questionnaires filled out by employees of a junior high school in southeast Texas. Most participants reported that they believed that social promotion was practiced in their school district. A majority of the participants did not believe that social promotion either benefited the student or improved self-esteem, and most of them did not endorse the practice of social promotion. Results suggest that social promotion does cause further academic  deterioration, confirming earlier studies that showed that students who repeat one or more grades are more likely to drop out of school. Teachers, however, are pressured to pass students so as to alleviate the grade-age problem caused by retention. It is argued that merely abolishing social promotion will not solve the problem. Special programs must be provided for failing students, which means that the educational system as a whole must change its belief system that all children learn at the same rate.

Participants in the study included 208 teachers who were graduate students in a college of education. The instrument used in the study consisted of 52 items that asked teachers to describe the frequency with which they perceived their principal to be practicing behaviors that could negatively or positively affect a teachers' supervisory climate. Findings show that the educational climate was more positive than expected but much  room for improvement remained. The lowest scores were in the conflict domain, which reflected teachers' views that their principals tended to avoid conflict, especially when a principal was reticent to question superiors. The behaviors in the trust domain were the most positive. Gender did not play a role in the supervisory climate, and it seemed that behaviors that promote a good supervisory climate affect both genders the same. However, female principals were rated better than male principals in instructional leadership. (Contains 12 references, 7 tables and the questionnaire.) (RJM)",

The study found that some key financial data were inaccurate and, in some cases, not even available. It examined the cost per student for each category of expenditure, finding these to be around $5,454 for 1997 and $5,758 for 1998. The study also looked at instructional expenditures and examined whether schools are providing the legally mandated number of instructional minutes. The study explored teacher certification and asked about the various teacher certifications and authorizations to teach. The study also investigated whether teachers are teaching  subjects in which they are certified, finding that at least 75 percent of teachers in five districts are teaching subjects in which they are certificated. The review found that some districts have nonclassroom teachers coded as classroom teachers. It looked at teachers', principals', and assistant principals' compensation and found some errors in remuneration. The report provides information on enrollment and students, class sizes, student-to-teacher ratios, free and reduced-price meals served in each district, student performance on standardized tests, and what districts do to avoid lawsuits.

The paper discusses the current role of the bursar and that person's  responsibilities, which include finances, human-resource management, pupil services, and other duties. The paper describes interactions between bursars and stakeholders in the school, which reveal that bursars interact with a wide variety of people in the course of their day.

The primary research questions of the study asked: what triggers major school change? what complexities surround school change? and what sustains the reform process and allows/encourages it to evolve? Data sources for the study included transcripts of audio-tapes from long interviews and followup interviews of key informants, field notes of university researchers, and related documents. Results show that initial changes in implementing the standards were mechanical--the lessons and materials did little to change teachers' existing beliefs and practices about mathematics. However,  the reform took a different direction when some K-4 teachers &quot;reinvented&quot; mathematics instruction around key ideas and processes within a relevant context for children. Tensions emerged as some teachers' instructional practices began to look different from those of other classrooms, and teachers began to write lessons to supplement the district curriculum. Chaotic situations challenged conventional leadership strategies, interrupted stability of the school climate, and suggested an uncertain future. The reform seemed to depend on educators who believed in the need to restructure and reculture schools. (Contains 36 references.) (RJM)",

The article discusses education costs and revenues, as well as how financial, student, and teacher data are transmitted from local school districts to state departments of education. The methodology for collecting data involved contacting officials from SREB states to identify and to request reports similar to Louisiana's Annual Financial and Statistical Report. The reports were reviewed and officials from SREB states were interviewed to determine sources of education revenue and reveal the types of education expenditures  for each SREB state. The findings revolve around 11 central questions, such as &quot;what percent of education dollars in SREB states comes from federal, state, and local funding&quot;? and &quot;how are education costs broken out in SREB states&quot;? Findings show that most SREB states operated their education system similar to the Louisiana Department of Education. Common themes emerged as related to education costs, revenue sources, teacher certification, and the definition of &quot;at risk&quot; students. Like Louisiana, SREB states rely heavily on local schools and districts to submit reliable and valid data. (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper presents a study that examined the processes used by a school community and school leaders in a K-4 elementary school to implement reform mathematics instruction. The research, based on a case study, explored the changing nature of classroom environments, where teachers created learning opportunities, and the transformation in leadership strategies and changes in teachers' roles and relationships. Overall, the paper discusses the creative tension between two cultures within the school--tension that seemed to foster continual renewal and professional growth. The report looks at the switch from behaviorism to constructivism in the classroom and how constructivism recognizes students and teacher as a community of learners. It provides a number of vignettes of how reform  measures operated in practice and how teachers came to understand the diversity of strategies and procedures students &quot;invented&quot; to solve problems. The paper also describes the creative tension between teachers who employed reform strategies and those who did not, and it discusses the principal's role in reform. New roles and relationships grew out of the collaborative decision-making between teacher-leaders and principals, and teachers began to realize that teacher leadership was necessary for instructional reform. Ultimately, success hinged on the teachers' willingness to take risks. (Contains 10 references.) (RJM)",

Results were compared to teachers' and principals' perceptions of actual and ideal school environments. The questionnaire was sent to 60 schools throughout Australia where it was to be completed by the principal and a random sample of 20 teachers in each school. Responses on 900 questionnaires were used. The study also employed interviews to expand the qualitative aspect of the research. Results indicate that the SLEQ is a reliable and valid instrument to measure perceptions of school environment. Analysis of responses to the SLEQ revealed that each scale had acceptable internal consistency. The teachers'  perceptions of their actual school environments were similar to those of other recent studies of school environment using the SLEQ. A comparison of teachers' and principals' actual perceptions showed that there were significant differences in the way that both groups viewed the school environment. Generally, principals scored higher on seven of the eight scales and lower on their perception of work pressure. Teachers and principals, however, had a much more congruent view of an ideal school environment, registering differences in only two of the eight scales. (Contains 24 references.) (RJM)",

Social capital is described as the resources available to actors that result from their interaction within a social network. Athletics provide many opportunities for parent-to-parent and parent-to-school personal interactions that have the potential of benefiting all within the school community. To secure data for this study, a multiple case-study approach was chosen. Three schools--one Catholic, one religious non-Catholic school, and one public school, all of which were relatively close in proximity--were selected for the study. Multiple sources of data were utilized, including school documents, interviews with key informants, faculty interviews or focus groups, parent surveys,  aggregate student-achievement scores, and observer notes. The interview data from all three schools indicated that the sports programs were important in bringing parents onto campus for an event in which they could interact. This interaction is often face-to-face, sustained, and frequent enough (sports fund raisers, sports banquets, sports events) to allow for the formation of social capital. The social capital thus generated by this interaction becomes a valuable resource for all within the school community. (RJM)",

The model describes schools in terms of their component parts. The model allows policymakers to make assumptions about how much improvement in student performance should be expected as a result of changes in funding. It also allows projections on the specific impacts of funding cuts on educational programs. The purpose of the model is not to dictate specific strategies or organizational structures to local schools. Instead, it is designed to demonstrate that a certain level of funding can be reasonably associated with a certain level of student performance. The paper explains the model, its composition, and its relationship to local control. The report explains  the hypothetical school approach and discusses assumptions about the schools and why assumptions are important. The paper discusses the characteristics of schools, a school's program elements and components, and how assumptions and costs for components are calculated using the model. The paper explores how the model works with elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. The paper then calculates the total cost for a K-12 education in Oregon. It details phased implementation of the model, the model's full implementation, and two approaches to implementation. (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a statewide study that examined the extent to which a safe school influences individual student achievement. The study used a two-level hierarchical model that included student characteristics and school conditions used in prior research. The statewide analysis was based on 46 of the 50 schools with grade 8 classes in one western state. The study used scores from the Stanford Achievement Test, along with data obtained from state department of education data bases for the school years 1993 through 1996. The findings suggest that school safety has statistically significant effects on students' grade 8 reading and mathematics achievement. Controlling for student background characteristics and differences in school conditions, students who are in safer schools  have higher grade 8 achievement scores than students who are in less-safe schools. The results suggest that schools with lower levels of school violence provide better learning environments for students in middle-level schools. Additionally, there was a statistically significant negative effect on student achievement associated with increased school disciplinary infractions after controlling for student background characteristics and school conditions. Since students who are in safer schools have higher grade 8 achievement scores than students who are in less-safe schools, school safety should receive increased attention from policymakers.

Social capital is defined as the resources available to actors that result from their interaction in a social network. The school sites selected for the study were relatively close in proximity to help control for social capital that is produced within communitywide structures, independent of the schools. Three schools (one Catholic; one non-Catholic, religious school; and one public school) were selected for the study. Multiple sources of data were utilized, including school documents, interviews with key informants, faculty interviews, focus groups, parent surveys, aggregate student-achievement scores, and observer notes. Results indicate that many of the types of activities that brought parents together at the  three schools were similar in nature. However, the social capital that formed as a result of the social networks associated with the large and small schools was different. The two smaller schools, by utilizing other additional activities that allowed them to take advantage of the community and social networks already established by their affiliated church, exhibited a denser social network than was found in the large school. In the large school, social capital was found in clusters of social networks with little overlap. (RJM)",

It discusses the extent of the unspent dollars, describes the characteristics of school districts that choose not to spend, and details what is sacrificed in districts that choose not to spend their entire budget. Financial data for the research were collected from the Michigan Department of Education for 1995-96. Descriptive statistics were calculated to determine state-level means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations for various categories of data. Results show that in terms of expenditures the biggest differences in districts' expenditure per pupil are due to the funding group and to differences in choices between functions. Although the evidence suggests that there are few differences  in the way districts spend their money, some have large balances left over. Reasons for this behavior could be due to the fact that since districts cannot control the level of revenue through local decision-making at the polls, they control their budgets by deciding not to spend. Another explanation for large fund balances may be due to the fact that school-district administrators do not wish to start programs that may have to be canceled due to future funding cuts. (RJM)",

Analysis of the written reflections reveals that the students' reflections were consistently the same length. In examining the structure of the reflections, 38 percent of the men, but almost none of the women, used bulleted or numbered lists. Men were also more likely to have grammatical errors  than women. An analysis of voice revealed that women used the third person more extensively than men and their reflections were more clinical sounding, as if they were quoting authorities. All of the men used the first person and wrote with authority. The participants' degree of self confidence, therefore, was another theme that emerged. The women's work appeared passive and tentative, while the men's reflections expressed confidence, assertiveness, and decisiveness. Overall, the study revealed gendered dichotomies in five areas: length, structure, voice, confidence, and collaboration. (RJM)",

Results reaffirm the commonly held belief that teachers are the primary force in a school's output. However, findings indicate that the teachers' influence on a school's organizational health is statistically less significant than that of the principal. The teachers saw themselves as the main characters within the school and the determinant of the productive output, yet it was the students themselves, the organizational health of the school, and the external community that determined the educational output. The findings suggest that whereas teachers may view the principal as a deliverer of goods and  services, they believe his or her task as the leader is to maintain the teachers' commitment to productivity, while drawing the parents and community into the school in a manner that the teachers find significant. Teachers also reported that the relationship between principals and teachers improves with empowerment, such as the empowerment derived from site-based management. It is recommended that when examining the educational environment, the principal's view be explored in conjunction with the teachers' outlook. (RJM)",

The text is based on a collaborative effort directed at diagnosing the needs of the Chicago schools. The article focuses on the perceptions of the probation process as reported by student-focus groups. Some of the themes that emerged from the focus groups included issues of equity, such as greater access to technology and longer school hours; mutual respect between teachers and students; the need for time management; and the pressure and stress associated with school. Also discussed are hurdles to high-school completion and student feedback designed to inform classroom change. The focus groups reinforced the need for consistent reflection, planning,  and organizing and the importance of teachers having the support to try new ideas. Part of the benefit of using an external partner in evaluating a school is that the process involves all stakeholders in sharing ideas, enabling the process in which solutions to problems come from a synergy of thoughtful and caring people involved in mutual cooperation. Adding student perceptions to those of teachers and administrative staff also enhances the credibility of partner recommendations and programming. (RJM)",

In  80 percent of the cases, however, the teacher left the school for one reason or another. The largest single outcome was early retirement. The second largest group of those who left were teachers who resigned, most frequently to take a job in another school or to leave the profession altogether. The paper looks at ways the process for dealing with incompetent teachers may be improved, what heads might do differently, the need for training in dealing with incompetence, and the constraints in dealing with this particular problem.

It presents an assessment protocol where the focus is on the school's mission. The instrument was developed to ensure that concepts, programs, and language would be true to the Catholic identity but would also be understandable to the population at large. The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 examines the process of assessing and planning, with a look at protocol. The second part presents the foundation documents for assessment. Included here are belief statements, the mission statement, the statement of philosophy, the graduate profile, and the parameters for implementing all the above. Part 3 takes a look at the state of the school. This section discusses the  school community, the climate and culture of school, its curriculum and instruction, its learning media resources, schedules, student services, student activities and athletics, professional development, governance and accountability, school finance, and school and community relations. The last section, which focuses on strategic planning, highlights the importance of planning as process, action plans, communication, implementation, and validation. An appendix lists the beliefs and directions outlined in the National Congress on Catholic Schools for the 21st Century. (RJM)",

Since 1985, the NPCD, which is a professional association of approximately 1,700 parish catechetical/religious education leaders, has surveyed parish Directors to profile their training and educational needs. The results in this current profile were obtained from 753 questionnaires. The findings offer a wide variety of information on catechetical leaders. Included are statistics on gender, age, marital status, years as catechetical leader, years in present parish, manner of employment, months of the year employed, salaries, salary satisfaction, benefits, preparation for catechetical leadership, degree majors, degrees being pursued,  and areas of responsibility in the parish. Also included in the study is information on religious education budgets and the percentage of parish budget allocated for parish religious education programs and parochial schools. The findings present details on catechetical effectiveness, catechetical concerns, and NPCD services. A final section analyzes popular beliefs about directors, such as the notion that directors of religious education are an aging population. The study concludes that earlier trends, such as steady increases in salaries and men receiving higher salaries than women, continue. Overall, catechetical leaders shared optimism about the future of catechetical education. (RJM)",

The findings are presented in five chapters: Institutional Characteristics, with emphasis on geography, governance, gender and grade levels, and selectivity; Staff and Student Profiles, which includes principals, presidents, teachers, and faculty; Governance; School Programs, both academic and religious education; and Patterns of Diversity. Findings show that Catholic high schools are becoming more private and that coeducation is on the rise. Staff composition figures, from 1983 to 1997, show that the percentage of Catholic high schools with sisters as principals fell from 40 percent to 23 percent. Accordingly, this  increased laicization meant that more laypersons had a greater say in policy development and implementation. Furthermore, school programs remained primarily non-selective, with a third of the schools offering accommodations for disabled or challenged students. Results portray the typical Catholic high school as having about 500 students, a student/teacher ratio of 13:1, high acceptance rates, a diverse student body, and advanced-placement courses. Overall, students are not tracked into college preparatory, although 97 percent of all Catholic high-school graduates go on to postsecondary education. (RJM)",

The instrument used to survey the schools was a 100-item questionnaire, which was based on an instrument used in a study of Catholic elementary-school finances in prior years. The questionnaire had four main parts: school demographics, financing, compensation, and special issues. Findings were based on 685 responding schools, and the results are divided into four parts. The first section examines income and pays particular attention to tuition, cost of materials, parish subsidies, fund-raising, and endowment funds. The next chapter looks at expenses, specifically per-pupil costs and salaries of principals, teachers, and other personnel. The third section discusses special issues, with an overview of  prekindergarten and kindergarten programs, extended-day programs, day-care program, technology, school-lunch programs, summer school, school uniforms, and other issues. The last section dwells on respondents' comments on fund-raising, development, management procedures, and parental involvement. Some of the highlights from the survey include average tuition, average per-pupil costs, average salaries for a lay principal and for a teacher, types of tuition aid, and the percentage of schools with a kindergarten program. An appendix features the survey form and a list of schools that responded. (RJM)",

Enrollment patterns, regional geographic trends, types and locations of schools, student and staffing demographic characteristics, and student participation in selected education programs are reported. The findings show that Catholic school enrollment has remained stable over the past year. While several of the large urban areas, such as Chicago, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh, have reported slight declines in enrollment, other areas, particularly the Southeast and West/Far West regions, have experienced modest increases. Waiting lists now exist in most suburban schools, and where diocesan and privately funded scholarship support is available in innercity schools, long waiting lists for  lottery-like selection processes have resulted. Overall, there were 8,217 Catholic schools, with 36 new schools opening during the period of the survey. Coeducational schools comprised 94 percent of all the Catholic schools, and 41 percent of all schools had a waiting list for admission. Total Catholic-school student enrollment was placed at 2,648,844, with 1,990,947 of these students attending elementary school. The student/teacher ratio was 17:1, with 153,081 full-time-equivalent professional staff. Four appendices provide a summary report of basic school statistics and information on professional staff, school locations, and supplemental services. (RJM)",

The study arose from protests directed at a California law requiring that a norm-referenced achievement test be used to assess school children on their mastery of basic skills. The paper describes the different uses and definitions of equity and fairness made by various individuals and organizations and delineates the ways in which different definitions of equity were developed politically in the educational and legal domains. The historical debate over equity in education is discussed along with the current debate and the controversy stirred by the call for testing. The article focuses on a case in San Francisco in which the superintendent of the  schools opposed the assessment testing, claiming that the stipulation that the testing be carried out in English only was unfair to many students for whom English was a second language. It describes the subsequent court case that arose when the superintendent sued the state to stop the testing. The case study here is used to illustrate the larger battle that is being waged throughout the U.S. regarding accountability and fair assessment. Contains 19 references. (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper claims that leadership, as a topic, has been disguised in behaviorism and obscured by organizational theory and management. The article examines the theories or metanarratives that have dominated educational administration and shows how they have covered and disguised leadership. It argues that the metanarratives--trait theory, behaviorism, structuralism, behavioral structuralism, broad fields, critical theory, and feminism--submerge leadership as other issues, such as management theory, are pursued. It asserts that all these metanarratives rest on the fallacy of an objectified self, which, even if influenced by language and culture, is believed to be benign so that the veil covering leadership can be lifted. Yet the record in this respect is paltry, and critical  theory has not produced any expanded vision for the nature of leadership. The article focuses on the literature of feminism and the argument by postmodernists that one cannot think without prejudice, that is, all perspectives are grounded in certain pre-assumptions that actively shape perception. The article concludes with the work of Jacques Lacan and Howard Gardner and their critique of behavioral psychology, positing that Lacan and Gardner offer an alternative to the obscurantist view of leadership that has become prevalent.

The 19 essays, written by principals of Catholic elementary/middle schools, vary in their message, but they all share a vision for the future of Catholic schools. The volume opens with an essay that explains how a school must establish its values before it can determine it vision for the future. The booklet addresses how everyone is invited to participate in a Catholic education, and it offers several poetical versions of the Catholic school of the future. It asserts that Catholic school teachers must be paid a fair, just wage and that the strength of Catholic education is its partnerships with the church and with the community. It explores what Catholic schools will look like in the year 2020 and encourages  principals to respond to various challenges in the same way that Jesus would have responded. The essays discuss chronological age versus readiness age, how Catholic schools can provide help to all students, various ideas of what Catholic schools will look like in the future, the family's future in Catholic schools, the challenge of stewardship, and restructuring Catholic schools for the 21st century. The book is intended to promote reflection and to stimulate dialogue. (RJM)",

SPICE was created to help Catholic-school leaders replicate partnerships that meet the needs of youth and their families. The book opens with an overview of the social conditions that currently affect young people and form the context in which Catholic schools exists. The next chapter describes 11 award-winning SPICE programs. Six programs are school-based initiatives that meet the diverse learning needs of students; three programs meet the psychosocial needs of students and their families; and two programs provide for the diverse needs of inner-city youth and their families. The next two chapters offer insights into pedagogical approaches that meet  the varied learning needs of students. Chapters 5 and 6 explore evolving models of collaboration on a broad national scale, focusing on collaborative efforts among school, family, and community and standards of practice of community-based educational collaborations. Chapter 7 looks at ways to optimize linkages with other ministries, whereas the remaining chapters treat special issues such as health-care needs, teaching from an English or British perspective, providing for the diverse needs of children, and leadership for solidarity.

        "description":"This book profiles extended-care programs in Catholic schools. It features articles submitted by graduates of the National Catholic Educational Association's Elementary/Middle School Principals Academies. Each of the 12 articles details an established extended-care program. Typically, these programs are part educational, part recreational, and part social, filling the hours before school begins and after it ends. The program descriptions, which are drawn from across the U.S., offer a short history of the programs; all the descriptions share the common theme of the dramatic changes that have transpired in extended-care programs over the past 10 years. The descriptions include special features of each program, community alliances, the fees charged for the children, the range of  grades that are served, the program schedule, the range of activities that are offered, safety protocols, discipline guidelines, health and safety, a typical day in the life of a student in the program, staffing and responsibilities, meals, supervision, creative approaches in serving the children, student rules, registration, staff qualifications, enrollment figures, and sample programs. It is hoped that educators seeking to implement an extended-care program can pick and choose from these descriptions those elements that would be most appropriate for their student population.

Chapter 1 discusses sources of the law and how fairness and due process, federal and state statutes, and various guidelines shape the law. Tort law, corporal punishment, search and seizure, defamation of character, and negligence are covered in chapter 2. Chapter 3 details issues surrounding student privacy and such issues as confidentiality of records, whereas chapter 4 describes the staff-student relationship and how the law governs confidentiality, sexual misconduct, physical contact, and other behaviors. Since student confessions can be an important part of the teacher-student relationship, legal aspects of confidentiality, legal immunity, case law, the student journal, and school retreats are discussed.  Chapter 6 looks at child abuse and neglect and considers statutory guidelines, inservice education, who should file a child-abuse report, and teachers and abuse. Sexual harassment is treated in the next chapter, which includes an overview of actions that constitute harassment and suggested policies for addressing reports of harassment. Other topics receiving treatment include accommodating students with special needs, extracurricular and cocurricular activities, personal conduct of professional staff, gangs, copyright law, school handbooks, and Catholic-school finances.

        "description":"This book was written for Catholic schools ready to launch an endowment or enhance an existing one. It is intended to be a resource for both Catholic elementary- and secondary-school administrators including principals and presidents, board members, development professionals, and alumni/ae. The volume outlines the three primary sources of funding for Catholic schools--tuition, fundraising, and endowment--and highlights the importance of having an endowment to keep tuition rates competitive. It discusses what an endowment is and why it is necessary for a school to have one. The steps for building an endowment include endowment promotion, who should support the endowment, who should ask for support, and techniques for soliciting annual, capital, and endowment gifts. The text then  addresses ways to increase the endowment, the need to have recognition societies for those who give large gifts or who include the school in their wills, tracking planned gifts, the role of the planned-giving committee, and planned-giving policies. The last chapter outlines ways to protect the endowment. Appendices present examples of personal-solicitation presentation materials, a school's mission statement, will-bequest provisions, endowment-fund recognition opportunities, standards for reporting planned giving, and gift policies.

Part 1, &quot;The Foundations of Catechesis,&quot; examines the purposes of Christian catechesis, the principles of catechesis from ecclesial documents, and the processes of catechesis. Part 2, &quot;The People of Catechesis,&quot; discusses the parish and family as catechist, the participants in catechesis, and the person of the catechist. The last section, &quot;The Realities of Catechesis,&quot; explores the qualities and competencies of the catechetical leader and includes  details on planning and improving parish catechesis, practicalities of catechesis, the general directory for catechesis, boards of education, canon law, religious-education handbooks, gangs and religious education, due process, privacy rights, the place of liturgy in catechesis, elements of catechetical planning, sources of catechetical leadership, the art of loving, and obstacles to a balanced spirituality.

It opens with a description of social promotion and the pervasiveness and the consequences of this practice. The volume outlines the high standards that all students should be held to and emphasizes the importance of creating reliable measures of achievement against standards. The guide details how high achievement can be attained consistently through the delivery of high-quality curriculum and instruction, through the inclusion of families, and through the involvement of community stakeholders. The guide highlights the importance of starting early and providing opportunities for the preschool years. The guide calls for a renewed emphasis on early childhood and family  literacy and discusses how to strengthen learning opportunities in the classroom. Some of these strategies include identifying and intervening early with students at risk of falling behind, ensuring that there is a well-prepared teacher in every classroom, using research-based practices, and reducing class size. Other possible solutions to social promotion involve extended learning, such as afterschool programs, developing ways to help students who fail to meet standards, and holding schools accountable for performance and then helping them to improve.

        "author":["Hertling, Elizabeth"],
        "description":"This digest explores the strategy of paying school administrators based on performance contracts. A performance contract is an agreement between an administrator--typically a superintendent--and the school board that links the administrator's pay to indicators of job performance. Most commonly, performance contracts include bonuses for a job well done and, less often, salary decreases for poor performance. The digest examines which indicators, such as student achievement, should be used to evaluate administrators' performance, and it outlines the pros and cons of linking these indicators to performance. It discusses the reasons behind offering administrators performance contracts when other education employees are not compensated in this way. It details the potential benefits of  performance contracts, such as the clarification of goals, the relative ease in dismissing a poorly performing administrator, and the symbolic demonstration of accountability that comes with such contracts. The final section of the digest outlines what critics say about performance contracts, particularly the worry that administrators will not be given the necessary resources to achieve their goals and the concern that if a larger paycheck is needed to motivate a superintendent then the problem may not be solvable through a contract.

Young adults who had completed a bachelor's degree earned substantially more than those who had earned no more than a high-school diploma or GED. Findings show that between 1980 and 1996, the earning advantage of obtaining a bachelor's degree or other higher degree increased for males, rising from 19 to 54 percent. Furthermore, during that same period the  earnings advantage of 25- to 34-year-olds with some college or a bachelor's degree or higher (relative to their counterparts who had completed high school) was generally greater for females than for males.

        "author":["Hallenbeck, Mark J."],
        "description":"This paper describes the use of a writing strategy, Cognitive Strategy Instruction in Writing (CSIW), to improve expository writing and student responsibility of four seventh-graders with learning disabilities. CSIW emphasizes the need for students to take responsibility for their own writing performance and to scaffold one another's writing development. The year-long study incorporated collaborative writing by the students within a special education resource room setting. Theoretical discussion examines social constructivism and the roles of student and teacher in constructivist dialogue. Principles of the CSIW model are explained, including: effective writing is a holistic enterprise; immature writers benefit from writing apprenticeships in which the teacher models the thinking  of effective underwriting; and students collaborate to write for authentic purposes and real audiences. Also explained are the CSIW instructional program and the taping of all instructional sequences and writing-related student conversations during the year for later analysis. Pretest and posttest analysis revealed impressive growth in the students' writing skills on the taught and practiced essay structure though not for an untaught and unpracticed expository structure. Many examples of classroom dialogue illustrate teacher modeling, teacher scaffolding, and classroom conversation showing peer support and the transfer of responsibility to the students. Appended are sample CSIW &quot;think sheets.&quot; (Contains 39 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"In light of recent trends to serve gifted students in regular classrooms, this paper reviews a variety of cost effective options for meeting the needs of gifted students. It notes effects of the inclusion philosophy which encourages education of all students in regular education classrooms, a lack of funds for special programs for gifted students, and the decline in textbook difficulty levels. The following options for accommodating gifted students are discussed: acceleration (early admission, grade-skipping, early graduation, or concurrent enrollment in college); cluster or ability grouping; curriculum compacting (the modification or streamlining of curriculum); enrichment (including both part time pull-out enrichment and in-class enrichment activities); mentoring with an expert  in the student's area of interest; and independent study. Research indicates that gifted students make the greatest progress when they are grouped homogeneously and offered a differentiated curriculum. The paper concludes that teachers need to advocate for acceleration or ability grouping and, whether their efforts are successful or not, they need to implement strategies within the classroom to challenge gifted students.

The teachers from both countries represented preservice teachers, regular classroom teachers, and teachers of the gifted. Emphasis was on the relationship of attitude to culture from which the teacher came. The relationship of attitude to demographic variables such as age, gender, having a gifted family member, and giftedness of respondents were also examined. The instrument used was the Attitude Scale toward Gifted Education developed by Gagne and Nadeau (1985). A new method to identify cross-cultural predictors of attitude based on Bayesian analysis was also applied. The study found that Finnish teachers were more concerned about the possible  negative social and affective effects of special classes or other services for the gifted outside the regular classroom. In addition, the new statistical methodology used was able to predict culture-dependent attitudes with 87.6 percent accuracy. Contains 14 references. (DB)",

T9 stands for \"typing with 9 keys.\" The basic T9 technology is designed so that 3 or 4 letters are printed on each of 7 keys, and an 8th key is used as an unambiguous \"space\" key. Each keystroke designating a letter is, therefore, ambiguous. The letters can be assigned to the seven keys in alphabetical order, but significantly greater efficiency in disambiguating key sequences can be achieved by assigning the letters in the following groups: THKP, MEG, ISYV, CLOJ, ADFX, QUNW, and BRZ. Each keystroke sequence is processed with a complete database containing the spelling of a huge lexicon of words. Words that match the sequence of keystrokes  are presented to the user in a list on the display. The most frequently occurring word is automatically selected unless the user presses the \"select\" key to select another choice. The benefits of using a reduced keyboard for meeting the communication needs of non-speaking individuals with severe motor impairments are discussed. (CR)",

The study also examined common career patterns among professional persons with psychiatric disabilities. Program participants (N=187), staff, and mentors were interviewed. Data were analyzed in terms of participant demographic characteristics, program satisfaction, higher educational history, employment history, employment outcomes, career patterns, independent living and housing, satisfaction with life, relative importance of employment, age of onset, and type of psychiatric disability. Conclusions include: (1) because Minnesota Mainstream has demonstrated success, it should be carefully replicated by other community-based rehabilitation  programs; (2) while the use of mentors shows promise, the results of this study are not conclusive; and (3) career development for persons with psychiatric disabilities is complex and variable, although five specific career patterns were identified. One recommendation is that the relative importance of vocational goals to other goals be considered during individual planning and service provision. Individual chapters review the related literature, describe the study's methodology, report results, and discuss conclusions. Three appendices contain sample data collection instruments, informed consent forms, and identification forms. (Contains 53 references.) (DB)",

Parents (N=52) of elementary and middle school children from three different rural school districts completed a questionnaire containing a Likert type scale and open-ended questions. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings indicated that, although parents perceived their participation as high, their actual level of participation was not high. Results also revealed that parents lacked knowledge about their children's disabilities and that they experienced difficulties in managing their children at home. The responses to the open-ended questions identified several obstacles to parents' school  involvement such as job schedules, transportation difficulties, and lack of child care. Questionnaire responses also suggested the presence of parental literacy problems. Parent training programs for improving parental involvement are recommended. Appendices include the questionnaire and tables analyzing responses to each question. (Contains 18 references.) (Author/DB)",

The objectives of the program were to increase the work completion of at least 6 of the 8 students with SED by at least 1 assignment during post-testing as compared to the teacher-made checklist documenting assignments completed during pre-testing, to increase attending behavior by 20 percent, and to demonstrate an increase of 20 percent in cooperative behaviors as documented on the teacher made observation record. Strategies implemented included group development, cooperative grouping, and group reinforcement. The target group was  taught how to work cooperatively in three phases: teams of two, four, and whole class. During implementation, group reinforcement was used to motivate students to complete social studies assignments while working collectively together. All of the program objectives were met, with the target group showing improvement in all areas.

        "description":"This paper examines antisocial behavior in children and youth in relation to the biosocial personality theory of Hans Eysenck. It explains Eysenck's theory, which includes a significant role for biological factors in the development of antisocial behavior. The theory holds that three temperament traits--Psychoticism (P), Extroversion (E), and Neuroticism (N)--interact with the environment to produce personality. Eysenck's measurement instruments also contain a Lie (L) scale that has been shown to function as an index of socialization or social conformity. Individuals with antisocial behavior are predicted to be high on the P, E, and N scales. Individuals at greatest risk for developing antisocial behavior are predicted to have above average P-scale scores. Aggressive individuals  are predicted to be higher on the E scale than on the N scale, and non-aggressive but antisocial individuals will be higher on the N scale than on the E scale. Individuals at greatest risk for antisocial behavior are also predicted to have below average L-scale scores. An overview of the theory, the possible basis for the temperament traits, and the research support for the prediction is discussed relative to children and youth with antisocial behavior.

Qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection were employed to gather data from 20 gifted adolescents identified as having perfectionist tendencies. Findings support the multidimensional theory of perfectionism, which states that perfectionism exists on a continuum with healthy to dysfunctional behaviors. Several differences existed between the healthy perfectionists and the dysfunctional perfectionists. Health perfectionists possessed an intense need for order and organization; displayed self-acceptance of mistakes; enjoyed high  parental expectations; demonstrated positive ways of coping with their perfectionist tendencies; had role models who emphasized doing one's &quot;best&quot;; and viewed personal effort as an important part of their perfectionism. Dysfunctional perfectionists lived in a state of anxiety about making errors; had extremely high standards; perceived excessive expectations and negative criticism; questioned their own judgments; lacked effective coping strategies; and exhibited a constant need for approval. Family, teacher, and peer influences on perfectionism were perceived as mostly positive for the healthy perfectionists, but negative for the dysfunctional perfectionist.

ITPs are intended to stimulate staff to think analytically and critically about therapeutic intervention as well as providing guidance in intervention implementation, thus creating an environment where students can decrease problematic behaviors and earn entrance into the mainstream student population. The Individualized Education Programs of all the students were reviewed and updated, and were used to create ITPs for students. Two ITP in-service training workshops were conducted and the  ITPS were reviewed with a service-providing team for an 8-week period. Student weekly point sheet averages during the final weeks of implementation were collected and pre- and post-practicum staff surveys were conducted. Analysis of the data demonstrated an increase in knowledge of the students' programming among the treatment providing team. Findings indicated that ITPs facilitated an interdisciplinary team-based approach to working with the students with EBD and increased the knowledge base of the staff, giving them more tools to help the students become successful.

The program includes both an assessment section and a curriculum section. The assessment consists of the Individual Education Plan (IEP) Assessment and the Family Interview Form. The skills measured by the assessment are organized into five developmental domains: social/emotional, adaptive, communication, physical, and  cognitive. The Family Interview Form provides an opportunity for families to report what their children can do outside of school and to identify priorities for the educational plan. The curriculum includes Planning Sheets for when to gather data, Teaching Records that suggest methods and materials for targeting IEP objectives and provide a recordkeeping system to track child progress, and Progress Reports that provide an accountability system for recording the child's overall progress during the academic year. The guide provides hints for conducting an assessment and for using each of the components. (CR)",

Findings indicate that families of children with special needs in Minnesota use TEFRA to help finance acute care which is either not covered by private health plans or is covered, but with high co-pays and deductibles. In addition, the TEFRA option funds many long-term care supports needed by the children and their families which are not typically covered by private health plans. The varying strengths, needs, and resources of these children and their families preclude the depiction of a  typical child on TEFRA. However, their family circumstances were found to be fairly reflective of average Minnesota families in terms of income, education, and geographic distribution. The study indicated that families of children with special needs incurred out-of-pocket health care costs nearly 5 times those of families without children with special needs. It concludes that the availability of TEFRA ensures that cost does not serve as a barrier to necessary health care. (CR)",

County A and B identified three factors as influential in the implementation of LRE: (1) state policy, (2) cost, and (3) organization of the Committee on Preschool Special Education. County A viewed the 1996 legislative changes as influential in affecting positive changes in the delivery system. Although the  county representative was responsible for the costs of preschool special education, all reaming groups in County A recognized the influence of cost in the implementation of the LRE mandate. All four groups in County A perceived a conflict of interest in the role of the evaluator at committee meetings. Some interviewees in County B viewed the 1996 legislation as a top-down state initiative, the cost was not viewed as influential, and the role of the evaluator was not perceived as a conflict of interest.

It recommends looking at the problem from the perspective of the student with autism in order to build in many elements of visual structure that will help the child understand exactly what is expected. Teachers are urged to look at each element of structured teaching to decide how visual supports can be added to build positive routines, clarify expectations, and reduce confrontational situations. How characteristics of autism might contribute to a child's difficulty in learning to use the toilet independently are explained. Steps in structured teaching that can be used to toilet train are then described and include: (1) assessing of the child's understanding of the  toileting process; (2) structuring the physical environment for success; (3) establishing a visually supported routine; (4) trouble-shooting specific problems, such as resisting sitting on the toilet, fear of flushing, over interest in flushing, playing in water, playing with toilet paper, resisting being cleaned, bad aim, and retaining when diaper is removed; and (5) planning a way for the child to initiate the toilet sequence. A list of children's books on toilet training is also provided. (CR)",

Site visits by a research team and expert panels (including both lay community members and professionals) were conducted as were six focus groups comprised of students, family members, general and special educators, administrators, school board members, and community agency representatives. The team visited: (1) Westerly, Rhode Island, where new leadership in the 1990s transformed a district with many civil rights violations into a model program for students who are receiving a continuum of supports and services for behavioral problems; (2) Polk  and Hillsborough County school districts in South Florida, where Project ACHIEVE, a schoolwide prevention and early intervention program, targets students who are academically and socially at risk; and (3) Lane County, Oregon, where the school district has successfully implemented a schoolwide violence prevention curriculum. The report's first three sections provide background information. Major cross-site findings are presented in the fourth section and the report concludes with a set of underlying principles reflected in each of the programs and schools. Four appendices list participants, materials, agendas, and the focus group questions. (Contains 78 references.) (DB)",

The second paper is \"Reading Comprehension Instruction for Students with Learning Disabilities\" (Russell Gersten and Scott Baker). Findings indicated the effectiveness of reading comprehension interventions, instruction in self-monitoring  techniques, and peer-assisted learning strategies. Continuing difficulties with teaching students to generalize new skills were also found. The third paper, \"Teaching Expressive Writing to Students with Learning Disabilities\" (Russell Gersten and Scott Baker), found that instructional writing interventions lead to significant improvements in students' writing and that common features of successful instruction included explicit instruction in the phases of writing, teacher demonstration, and teacher and/or peer feedback. The final paper, \"Intervention Research for Adolescents with Learning Disabilities\" (H. Lee Swanson), reported on a meta-analysis of 58 interventions.

The review covered studies performed over the last 33 years at 41 research sites throughout the world with more than 34,500 children and adults. Evidence and findings are outlined for each of these three areas. Among nine conclusions concerning how children learn to read is that reading is not a natural process and learning to read is a lengthy process that begins substantially before formal schooling. The 15 conclusions for why some individuals have difficulties learning to read are grouped into  those concerned with prevalence, developmental course, and psychometric characteristics and those concerned with environmental, experiential, and individual difference factors. In presenting conclusions about reading instruction, the seven conclusions focus on which teaching approaches and strategies are most beneficial for which children at which stages of reading development.

Participants were five teachers with students who exhibited challenging behaviors. Prior to the workshop, a needs assessment was conducted which found that the school had a high rate of referral and placement in restrictive alternative settings and that teachers desired training in behavior management techniques. Intervention involved five components of services provided to the teachers by the researcher: (1) the inservice training; (2) on-going consultation regarding behavioral problems; (3) assistance with implementation of behavioral interventions; (4) instruction and assistance with data collection; and (5) provision of a safe environment  for teachers to discuss classroom concerns. The inservice training covered discipline and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, characteristics of children with behavioral and emotional difficulties, behavior management strategies, and data collection methods. Teachers were helped to select three target behaviors for intervention. Although evaluation did not show initial objectives were achieved, due primarily to loss of most of the targeted students, evaluation did find that teachers implemented behavior interventions more consistently and spent less time on discipline and more time on teaching than before the workshop. The needs assessment, pre-implementation, and post-implementation teacher surveys are appended. (Contains 19 references.) (DB)",

Overall, research is reported that shows that when PBS strategies are implemented schoolwide, children with and without disabilities benefit. Specific research reports are summarized and their key recommendations outlined. These studies support the implementation of PBS goals with guidelines  such as alter the student's environment; provide schoolwide support; develop post-behavioral expectations in every classroom; use a cognitive-behavioral time-out strategy; implement specific positive supports for individual students; conduct functional assessments; understand cultural influences on behavior; work with families; and use technology to disseminate information.

Data from 199 schools revealed that most middle schools in New York do not have programs for the gifted and when they do, minority students are underrepresented. A multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated that none of the identification procedures commonly used were useful for identifying minority gifted students. Commonly used identification procedures included grades, standardized test scores, teacher referral, parent referral, and self-referral. Regardless of which identification procedures were used, or the number of identification procedures available, gifted minorities were not identified. The one factor that emerged related to minority identification was that teacher  training (e.g., workshops, inservice, etc.) facilitated the identification of minority gifted students. However, the data suggested that teacher training does not affect the identification of all ethnic minority groups. African-Americans were more likely to be identified as a result of teacher training, whereas the training did not affect the identification of Latino-Americans. (Contains 36 references.)

This guide, designed to encourage and guide Minnesota school districts in enhancing student achievement and school-community partnerships, summarizes changes in laws and regulations for educational facility funding options and construction project proposals; highlights some of the latest ideas in planning and designing school sites, space design, and related issues; and examines essential considerations when designing middle level and community use/partnership spaces in schools. Minnesota state regional and local agency procedural requirements for school construction project review are included. Related  issues and considerations involving the development of partnerships with community groups, public agencies, and private users; urban and rural schools; school security; indoor air quality; lighting and electrical systems; and charter and private schools conclude the guide.

The term \"mainstreaming\" is defined as it is applied to this population, and guiding principles for effective classroom mainstreaming are presented. Classroom instructional behaviors and techniques found to be effective in supporting the learning process of linguistically diverse students are specified, most concerning classroom communication and presentation of information. Classroom activities recommended for use with this population are listed, and common characteristics of urban  children are noted. A series of useful strategies to be used individually or combined for effective instruction are detailed, and a checklist of questions the teacher can ask himself concerning the students, syllabus, instructional materials, and teaching techniques is included.

        "description":"A study investigated the Educational Testing Service's claim about the conversational nature of the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) from the perspective of native speakers of the target second language. Eight subjects listened to 16 randomly-selected OPI communicative speech events, and their perceptions were measured using a semantic differential instrument. Analysis of the data indicate that with few exceptions, native speakers did not differ in their judgments of the nature of the OPI communicative speech event; they found that the OPI does not test speaking ability in the real-life context of a conversation as it claims to. The OPI tests speaking ability in the context of two interview types: a very formal interview that has many features of a survey research interview,  based on the behaviorist theory of stimulus and response, and a more conversational type of interview that has many features of a sociologic interview. It is concluded that the findings raise questions about the validity of the OPI testing instrument. (Author/MSE)",

The discussion is presented in two parts. The first outlines the issues under consideration, including distinctions between foreign language learning and second language acquisition and between the communicative approach to second language instruction and explicit language instruction. It also examines the importance of prior knowledge in the cognitive process and the role of the native language in second language learning, drawing on theory and research in these areas. The second part presents the example of ESL learners of Chinese  cultural background, focusing on the role of cultural differences in language learning. Specific linguistic differences between Chinese and English are considered, including the use and construction of indirect expressions, linear vs. circular thinking patterns, differences in intonation, and differences in verb tense and time reference.

It begins with an overview of current research on study abroad, its relationship to foreign language programs, and the innovations that this growing research base holds for program development. Attention then turns to Russian language teaching and the 1993 study, \"Predictors of Foreign Language Gain During Study Abroad\" (Predictors study). Discussion focuses on the compatibility of data analysis results with interpretations and implications for second language learning, instructional materials, and program development. The questions raised in this discussion lead to the final section: prospects for increasing understanding of the role of study abroad  in the teaching and study of the Russian language. In this section, strategies are suggested for strengthening existing predictor models, study designs, questions to be addressed, and variables that might lead to an increased understanding of SLA during study abroad and the pragmatic applications for designing optimal study abroad experiences.

Data were drawn from teacher, students, and administrator interviews in 12 school studies and a survey of modern language teachers and a sample of students from 100 schools taking standardized modern language exams. Results indicate a major increase, over 20 years, in language enrollments at S4 level, but a major decline in enrollments at High Grade level, both in absolute terms and relative to other subjects. Two factors unique to Scotland are identified: limited exposure to foreign languages outside school, and lack of shared motivation within Scottish society. Perceptions of public policy on modern language education was found to have little effect on  enrollment. Students are more critical of the language curriculum than of teaching methods, resources, class size, or ability grouping. Learners did not find second language learning intrinsically motivating, needed more support for their interest in other languages and cultures, saw few short-term benefits in language learning, and lacked clear expectations of language study. Recommendations are made for changes in the structure of the modern language program, in course content, teaching methods, resources, recruitment, and in promotion of lifelong language learning.

Tandem language learning is a form of open learning in which two individuals with different native languages work together to learn each other's language, in this case, English and German; success depends on adherence to the principles of reciprocity and learner autonomy. The report describes the network and the principles of tandem language learning by e-mail, the organization of this part of the study, including pedagogical design and considerations, the process of affective  and linguistic data collection, and data analysis. The linguistic data analysis focused on bilingual skills, language register, discourse fillers, punctuation, explicit coordination between partners, error correction and generalizations made, thematic content, control and critical detachment, use of metalanguage, and accuracy of corrections.

Most language policies and syllabuses espouse improved cross-cultural understanding and more favorable cross-cultural attitudes as central goals. The report details a study conducted in Queensland (Australia) schools concerning the effect of language learning on cross-cultural attitudes and identifying variables in the language teaching/learning process that influence cross-cultural attitudes. Data were drawn from a survey of 598 grade 10 students concerning cross-cultural attitudes and a survey of 24 teachers concerning their values in language teaching. Results indicate a generally positive student attitude toward languages but do not show a correlation between  language learning and language attitudes, only suggesting that student background variables may influence attitudes. The teaching methods and class activities favored by students were those felt to be conducive to favorable cross-cultural attitudes, but were low among teacher priorities.

Influenced heavily by the work of psychologist Lev Vygotsky, the theory assumes that the way teachers think about and teach culture should result from an understanding of how sociohistorical conditions produce cultural change. Students first learn to look for underlying technological and economic factors that create differing cultural behaviors, customs, values, beliefs, mythologies, and psychologies. They then practice various socially mediates adaptive responses to historically based cultural conditions. It is argued that only by combining theory and practice in this way can true intercultural empathy be developed. Case studies from the everyday lives  of individuals around the world are cited as examples, and a practical framework for teaching culture in the foreign/second language classroom is presented.

        "description":"A study investigated how Korean learners of English as a second language (ESL) differ from native speakers of English in the use of supportive moves and in the expression of politeness (use of downgraders) in requests, a speech act considered to be face-threatening. Three groups of subjects participated: 30 Korean students enrolled in an intensive university ESL program; 30 native English-speaking American university students; and 30 Korean students in a Korean university, who served as a control group for the Korean subjects. Each group was administered a discourse completion test, in which they were asked to read the descriptions of 12 situations and write down what they would say in each situation. The request realizations by the Korean ESL students were compared with those of  the English native speakers in terms of supportive moves and downgraders. Analysis of the results is presented. They indicate that patterns of the ESL learners differed greatly from those of native speakers of both English and Korean, suggesting not transfer of skills from language to language but some idiosyncrasies. Explanations and pedagogical implications are considered. The discourse completion tasks are appended. Contains 41 references. (MSE)",

Data were gathered in a mail survey of 1,566 modern language teachers and 560 social  studies teachers, and telephone interviews with 191 of the respondents. The report details both the surveys and the findings, and makes recommendations for teacher education and staff development, instructional materials and materials selection, techniques for building support of administrators and the public, and cross-disciplinary cooperation and teaching.

The HBGSI is a 90-item checklist to be completed by teachers, developed in response to the underrepresentation of Hispanic students in gifted education programs. Subjects were 175 children from two schools, who were native Spanish-speakers with a wide range of English language skills. Data analyses are summarized here.

The second and third sections detail the study, conducted in a Swiss secondary school, which had the dual objectives of examining the relationship between self-concepts and instruction and investigating the effectiveness of a series of classroom techniques designed to support self-concept and identity issues in language learning. The second section provides background information and  theoretical foundations for the study, and the third section analyzes the results of implementation of the class activities.

Interviews were conducted with 16 faculty members at a private research university in a small United States city. Interviewees included eight African American women, three African American men, two Asian American women, one Asian American man, and two Latino men; all were tenured or on tenure track. Faculty evaluations were based on teaching, service, and scholarly achievement, defined primarily through research and publication. During open-ended, semistructured interviews participants were asked to talk about their promotion and tenure experiences. Faculty members' perceptions of racism were then classified into two  categories: individual or institutional. It was found that faculty members negotiated and resisted racism as best they could; responses ranged from &quot;giving up,&quot; to fighting back, to picking and choosing battles, to playing the game, finding mentoring support, and most importantly to defining promotion and tenure criteria in ways that benefited their racial communities that is, through &quot;race&quot; research and minority-related community service. The paper concludes that creating a more supportive environment for faculty of color will require the construction of a common understanding of race in higher education. (Contains 78 references.)

It reports that APA women face the \"double bind\" of discrimination because of their minority status and because they are female, and that compared to other minority women fewer APA women enter the education profession. The paper argues that in order to attract more APA women to higher education administration, colleges and universities must provide training programs in educational leadership that recognize cultural and gender differentiation, and also state their commitment to providing guidance and opportunities that make it possible for APA (and other minority women) to overcome the barriers that keep them from ascending the ranks of educational institutions. Higher  education curriculum planners also need to enhance educational leadership programs by focusing the curriculum more on areas such as communication skills, goal setting, mentoring and networking, and organization and preparation. The paper also maintains that APA women who aspire to positions in higher education administration must actively participate in their own development. (Contains 20 references.) (MDM)",

The state's population has increased substantially since 1950 and continues to increase at a high rate, placing significant demands on public and private higher education. An aversion to tax increases in the state, the low tuition charged by state colleges and universities, and the lack of coordinated educational planning are major factors influencing higher education policy in the state. Florida needs to better utilize private colleges and universities to meet the growing educational needs of its population. Among the conclusions reached are the following: Florida  needs to encourage broad public discussion of policy issues facing the state; it must seek greater mission differentiation among institutions, truth-in-pricing of higher education, institutional accountability in regard to learning outcomes, and better coordination between higher education and the business community; public policy must consider the state's independent institutions an integral part of the state system of higher education; and the state must make a greater investment in learning infrastructure.

It notes that faculty-administration relations at the small liberal arts college had soured in the early 1990s as a result of faculty salary issues. The plan posits that as the college's resources increase or decrease relative to the mean of nine comparison institutions, Wheaton faculty salaries will change by the same margin. The &quot;floor&quot; of the plan stipulates that faculty salaries will increase at the rate of the consumer price index, while the &quot;ceiling&quot; stipulates that if Wheaton faculty  salaries become equal to the mean salaries at the comparison institutions, they will not exceed that mean until Wheaton's resource base increases to within 20 percent of the average resources of the comparison institutions. The plan was successfully implemented and created a climate in which faculty began to consider themselves stakeholders in the institution's financial well being, leading to their increased participation in recruitment, retention, and fund raising.

The instructions provide a step-by-step guide to using the BRIDGE software, including the adjustment of default settings.

The paper defines the terms accountability and regulation, examines the use of performance indicators to demonstrate accountability, and explains how performance indicator-based accountability and regulatory mechanisms are used as policy instruments. The paper also discusses traditional approaches to resource allocation and recent developments in resource allocation, including performance-based funding. The paper outlines the pressures placed on governments by globalization, the right-wing political ideologies that give these pressures political voices, the resultant change in the role of government, and the  development of academic capitalism. The paper notes that government policy has induced academic capitalism in Alberta's higher education system and describes Alberta's performance-based funding mechanism. The paper concludes by outlining some criticisms of the performance indicators used in Alberta's funding mechanism and discussing the implications of the performance-based funding mechanism in the province.

        "description":"This report presents a comprehensive overview of the parental role in higher education. It is on various data sources, including a nationally representative survey of 750 parents of current college students. The report addresses issues ranging from selecting an institution, to paying tuition, to patterns of saving and borrowing, to the demographic characteristics of both parents and students. Major findings include the following: (1) although parental financial assistance appears to be increasing modestly, the dollar amounts are covering a smaller proportion of the average price of attendance; (2) most parents are not going into debt to provide financial assistance to their children, but those who do borrow are borrowing larger amounts; (3) parents may not be realistic about what  they should expect to pay for college; and (4) the most important factors influencing how much parents pay to assist their children appear to be income and the total price of attendance. Following an executive summary and an introduction, report sections address the following topics: changing roles, previous research, characteristics affecting parental roles, examination of data from the National Center on Educational Statistics, the study's parent survey, and conclusions from the survey's findings. Seventeen tables detail study findings. Appended are additional methodological and statistical information. (Contains 35 references.) (DB)",

The study is based on data on about 325,000 loans from the USA Group's entire loan servicing portfolio, which includes both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans issued under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The study examined debt levels for four borrower groups categorized by school type: four- and five-year institutions, graduate and professional schools, two- or three-year colleges, and proprietary vocational schools. Findings are detailed for the following: (1) average Stafford balances, principal only; (2) average cumulative Stafford indebtedness, including principal and  accrued interest; (3) indebtedness levels, borrower distribution; (4) data suggesting that the debt burden growth is beginning to moderate; (5) minimum annual income needed to support post-school indebtedness; and (6) development of payment stress indicators, including repayment plan selection rates, repayment status and delinquency rates. Conclusions indicate that students are going more deeply into debt to finance their postsecondary education, with graduate students borrowing the most under the Stafford loan program.

It reviews such state-related issues as access, accountability, and dwindling financial and political support; federal government aid and regulations; public perceptions of higher education; and demographic implications. Additionally, public university administrators throughout the country were surveyed and asked to identify key elements of their enrollment management programs; to diagram administrative structures; to explain which of four models committee, coordinator, matrix, or division most closely approximated the structure at their institution; to evaluate their enrollment management program and its longevity; to discuss ethical concerns; and to  provide advice to newcomers. Summarizing this information, text chapters do the following: cover demographics; define the four models of enrollment management; examine links between enrollment management and other institutional programs; review earlier enrollment management studies; examine enrollment management practices at major public universities in all areas of the country; define appropriate structure and mission; list three general goals of enrollment management; examine the value and credibility of higher education; examine how to evaluate quality; note the role of faculty; provide advice to the novice; and examine some ethical dilemmas.

Data were obtained from the California Postsecondary Education Commission and the Department of Corrections. It was found that over the last 10 years, spending for higher education decreased as a percent of the general fund from 15 to 13 percent, or approximately $1.2 million; for the same period spending for corrections increased 60 percent. Since 1980 university fees have risen 303 percent in the University of California (UC) system and 485 percent in the California State University (CSU) system; in the same period 21 new prisons were built and prison guard salaries more than doubled. African Americans make up 7 percent of the  state's population and 31 percent of state prisoners, but account for only 5.5 percent of students in the UC and CSU systems. Hispanic Americans are also under-represented in California's university systems and over-represented in the state's prisons. The results indicate that under Governor Wilson's tenure, more people of color entered the prison system than entered full-time undergraduate four-year colleges; the Wilson administration also saw the highest levels of prison growth and college tuition increases in the state's history.

FRAP objectives include filling all vacancies on time; recruiting and hiring the best qualified candidates available; attracting among the newly hired faculty an ethnic, gender, and cultural diversity comparable to the student body; providing an adequate amount of time, funds, and human resources to achieve objectives; identifying a set of desirable attitudes and  characteristics to be possessed by new faculty; maintaining a 90 percent retention rate among newly hired faculty after 5 years; and having a faculty which, as a group, has a set of certain defined desirable characteristics. Six appendixes provide information on faculty recruitment task force members, faculty duties, teaching portfolios, salary schedules, search procedure checklist, and a bibliography. (MDM)",

        "description":"This paper provides a review of the literature on the roles and responsibilities of the academic departmental chair in colleges and universities. Carroll and Gmelch (1992) found four orientations in a factor analysis of department chair duties: leader chairs, scholar chairs, faculty developer chairs, and manager chairs. Creswell and Brown (1992) found seven distinct roles: two administrative (provider and enabler), one external (advocate), and four interpersonal (mentor, encourager, collaborator, and challenger), suggesting that different roles are appropriately used by chairs in dealing with faculty in different stages of their careers. In &quot;Chairs in Transition&quot; (1990), the Center of the Study of the Department Chair noted that the transition from faculty member to department  chair required a major paradigm shift on the part of the individual. Gmelch and Burns (1993) identified three particular areas of stress for departmental chairs, namely, time pressures, confrontation with colleagues, and organizational constraints. Suggestions for relieving stress include restructuring the position, purging unnecessary &quot;administrivia,&quot; protecting research interests, and training for leadership. Suggestions for academic departmental chairs themselves include time management, conflict resolution, enabling constraints, and academic productivity. (Contains 12 references.) (MDM)",

Data were obtained from 35 institutions for the period 1985 through 1994, and for 7 of the 10 years, from two additional institutions. It was found that the 37 institutions accounted for a total of 1,745 Ph.D. degrees in agricultural economics between 1985 and 1994, with a slight downward trend in degrees produced between 1985 and 1992, but then noticeable increases in both 1993 and 1994. The ten institutions with the largest number of Ph.D. degrees accounted for 45 percent of total output. Fewer than one-third of the individuals who received Ph.D. degrees between 1985 and 1994 belonged to the American Agricultural Economics Association  (AAEA) in 1995. Approximately 90 percent of degree recipients who were members of the AAEA in 1995 and residing in the United States were employed by an academic institution or government agency. The results indicate that the number of Ph.D. degrees in agricultural economics has not shown any dramatic growth or decline over the last couple of decades. (Contains 12 references.) (MDM)",

        "description":"This paper argues that a hermeneutic perspective--the art of interpreting and understanding across differences--should be considered in any educational discussion about leadership. It explains that hermeneutics searches for understanding and creates meaning, not explanation. The paper goes on to examine the educational philosophy of John Dewey, noting that he regarded science and the scientific method as a matter of hermeneutics of shared interpreting and meaning-making. Dewey, instead of favoring narrow specialization, desired those qualities, such as initiative, inventiveness, and readaptability, that would enable education to be a life-long process of growth. It is concluded that hermeneutics and a Deweyan educational philosophy point toward a leadership paradigm in which work  groups move toward a horizontal rather than vertical decision-making process, with collegiality--democratic cooperation--instead of a marked polarity between leaders and followers. Authority will be shared because meaning-making and inquiry are shared experiences, and leaders will emerge situationally in a community respectful of individual and communal growth.

This information was deemed significant for two reasons: (1) contributions from graduates are increasingly important sources of funds for colleges and universities; (2) information on why alumni contribute is important for future fund-raising efforts. Data were obtained from a random sample of 300 alumni who had graduated between 1975 and 1990 from a private university in Alabama; the data set included 10 alumni from each year who had been RAs and 10 from each year who had not been RAs. Data collected on RAs indicated that their demographic profile included the following characteristics: they were non-donors to the university, residents of Alabama,  non-participants in alumni activities, female, Baptist, education majors, married, and had two children. For those former RAs who did provide contributions, the average gift size was $103, with a range of $10 to $2,500. It was also found that individuals who were RAs graduated in an average of 4.07 years, compared to 4.103 years for non-RAs. Involvement by RAs in giving and volunteering were both determined to be low, but positive. (Contains 17 references.) (MDM)",

Telephone interviews were conducted with 400 randomly selected graduates; an additional 400 interviews were conducted with a random sample of ethnic minority graduates.

Of these, 35.3 percent were attending a four-year college or university and 32.1 percent a two-year college. The study found that the  major reasons for choosing or not choosing a college were related to academic reputation, costs, and proximity to home. The affordability of Oregon University System (OUS) institutions compared to other four-year college options was a major factor for students who chose an OUS institution.

These goals guided the development of nine performance measures and indicators focusing on degree completion (six-year graduation rates), graduate abilities at degree completion, customer satisfaction, new students, student quality and diversity, graduate success and unmet state needs, external resources and entrepreneurship, state investment, and institutional management. An overview of the baseline performance of all OUS campuses found that the six-year graduation  rate for entering freshmen had improved at five institutions, remained stable at one, and declined slightly for another. The pass rate for professional licensure examinations exceeded national pass rates for nearly all professional areas. The proportion of racial/ethnic minorities enrolled in regular programs increased for all OUS institutions, and the proportion of recent graduates employed or enrolled in graduate or professional school within 12 months of graduation ranged from 80 to 93 percent.

        "description":"This paper reviews the history of sabbatical leave in secondary and postsecondary education, as well as contemporary research on sabbatical leave, and offers some personal narratives of the sabbatical experience. It explains that sabbatical leave programs began at Harvard University in 1880, with professors granted a year of leave at half-pay every seventh year. By the early 1930s, 178 institutions had started this practice. Contemporary research on sabbatical leave suggests that it is a positive tool for enhancing faculty morale; that it allows faculty to study, carry out research, and travel; and that it has a positive impact on the institution. Narratives on the sabbatical have stressed the creative, rewarding nature of the experience; the ability it allows to acquire an  advanced degree or a new language; and its rejuvenating effects. It is concluded that sabbatical leaves have a justifiable place in education when viewed as a form of faculty development, and that sabbaticals can make a difference in faculty career life-stages.

        "description":"This symposium paper reviews the literature on adult students in higher education and offers a model of their collegiate experiences. The review is organized according to the following themes: adults' experiences in higher education, social and psychological concerns, the role of the classroom, adult cognition, the adult-world surroundings, and adults' success in college. Also discussed are three alternative frameworks for conceptualizing and researching adult involvement. These include schema that examine learner involvement through adult life roles, learner participation in lifelong learning, and learner participation in a post-modern society. Also proposed is a comprehensive model that considers the relationships among six major elements related to adults' collegiate  experiences: (1) prior experiences; (2) orienting frameworks such as motivation, self-confidence, and value system; (3) adult cognition, including declarative, procedural, and self-regulating knowledge structures and processes; (4) the \"connecting classroom\" as the central avenue for social engagement and for negotiating meaning for learning; (5) the life-world environment and the concurrent work, family, and community settings; and (6) the different types and levels of learning outcomes experienced by adults.

        "description":"This study developed a statistical model to identify college students most prone to dropping out, testing the model to predict the retention status of black residential and white commuter students at an historically black institution with an open admissions policy. The model used 25 pre- and early-matriculation variables, including gender, age, ethnicity, citizenship, state and country of residency, enrollment status, high school class size, high school rank, high school grade point average, scores on the American College Testing(ACT) Service examination, grades in developmental courses, number of developmental courses required, first-semester credit hours attempted and completed, first-semester grade point average, and cumulative grade point average. Multivariate models (both  direct and forward stepwise) using logistic regression analysis were developing using data from a sample of 1,949 first-time degree-seeking freshmen who entered the institution from 1990 through 1995. Compared to withdrawing students, returning students were significantly more likely to report better academic habits and goals, to have higher ACT scores and higher high school grades and class rank, to be a white commuter student, and to attend college full-time. Overall, the forward stepwise model was judged better for predicting retention status than the direct model. Results have implications for early identification of high-risk students.

Specifically addressed are external pressures related to changing standards for school administrators and competition for program delivery. Local responses include increased involvement in (as well as resistance to) the use of technology by students, teachers, and administrators. Concerns and problems experienced by students, administrators, and faculty in the ISU program are discussed. The paper concludes that distance education is an alternative modality for reaching students that  must be considered and implemented in some form, but that it requires institutional, faculty, and student commitment.

Students at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania, who were enrolled in either traditional (n=195) or distance learning (n=100) wellness and physical education curricula, anonymously completed a questionnaire designed to assess demographic variables and rank criteria considered in course selection. These criteria included two variables that addressed chronology; one variable that focused on curriculum concerns; three variables focusing on performance issues; six variables for instructional issues; and one variable that allowed identification of other considerations. Participants in traditional courses identified curriculum  relatedness (class content) as the most important criterion, while subscribers to the distance learning format were primarily concerned with chronology (scheduling convenience). Among the younger traditional students, anecdotal responses suggested course selection was driven by a concern with expeditiously fulfilling university or curriculum requirements. Results suggest that courses available via distance learning are more attractive to older, nontraditional students. (DB)",

Several different off-campus student cohorts at Illinois State university enrolled in both a fall semester qualitative research methods class and a spring semester quantitative research methods class. Both classes combined asynchronous web-based materials with synchronous audio and video transmissions. Both courses used a combination of Real Media's Real Encoder and Real Player technology (for transmitting the audio and video components of the live class from the instructor to the remote students) and real-time chat and discussion group software (for bi-direction typewritten interaction between the remote students and the instructor).  Both courses demonstrated that it was possible to deliver even highly technical research-oriented courses over the Internet using streaming audio and video technologies. However, both courses also encountered several critical problems and issues, such as a sense of disconnection from the group by distance students and added time pressures for instructors.

Students were located in a public school district three and one-half hours from campus. The course utilized several in-person sessions (both on- and off-campus), e-mail, and a dedicated Web site. The majority of classes, though, were held synchronously over the Internet using CU-SeeMe client and server software. Students reported generally enjoying the class, although the multiplicity of continuing technical issues and steep computer learning curve were problems for some. Evaluation indicated that all the students passed the course, with assignment grades and test scores no different from those earned by similar on-campus students  in prior semesters. However, course delivery required an enormous amount of time and technical expertise on the part of the instructor and the school district technical staff. Instructors contemplating this mode of content delivery are urged to be aware of both benefits and costs, especially in terms of time for instructor and student training, multiple modality and error-alternative preparation, and practice.

The first phase of the project involved: (1)data collection on about 800 individuals, through surveys, focus groups, interviews, and anecdotal data; (2)a daylong workshop, involving approximately 200 part-time faculty and key administrators, which focused on concerns, issues, and claims of all stakeholders and resulted in a series of recommendations and action plans; and (3)formation of action groups of part-time academic staff to work on changing the practice of part-time teaching at the institution. In a follow-up study two  years later, six part-timers who had participated in the focus sessions in the first phase of the study were interviewed and 140 part-timers were surveyed. The study did not find significant improvements in the situation of part-time faculty. The paper suggests that the current situation of marginalization and dual labor forces is dominated by the market and corporate paradigms can be expected to persist unless part-timers are afforded opportunities to contribute to course development and develop their teaching skills. The study is continuing with a multi-institutional focus. (Contains 28 references.) (DB)",

The study focused on differences in research self-efficacy and dissertation progress among students from the three different departments within the college of education at an urban Southern research university. Subjects (n=97) had completed their course work and passed written and oral comprehensive examinations during the years 1987-1997, but had not completed their degrees by December 1997. Subjects responded to a mailed questionnaire that asked questions related to research training, research environment, research involvement, graduate  assistantships, relationships with advisors and committee members, research self-efficacy, dissertation status, and demographics. Results indicated that both students' research self-efficacy and their relationships with their advisors and committee members significantly contributed to dissertation progress, and these effects were consistent for all students, regardless of gender, age, degree of financial impediments, or number of years in the doctoral program. None of the student background characteristics were found to have a significant effect on dissertation progress. Also, students' perception of their research training, but not their research environment, was positively related to dissertation progress. (Contains 43 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"This study examined how campus peer culture influences the ways in which multiracial students make meaning of their racial identity, and applies Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological model of cognitive development to analyze elements in the college environment that stimulate or inhibit identity development. Discussion of the situation of multiracial students in the context of student development and identity development theory is followed by explanation of the model used in this study, which involves microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems, and macrosystems. The study focused on perceptions of 24 students at three undergraduate-focused institutions and had four main components: individual interviews with participants; written responses by participants; a focus group of three or four  students per campus; and analysis of and archival data about each campus concerning multiracial issues. Data were organized according to Bronfenbrenner's ecology model. A major theme that emerged was the meaning and importance that students attached to finding a space to fit in on campus. Results are interpreted in terms of the kinds of spaces, or microsystems, students occupied on campus and how these microsystems interacted to create the mesosystem of peer culture and the ecology of multiracial identity development.

        "description":"The Beginning Department Chair Study used qualitative methodology to examine the developing identities of 13 new department chairs at 10 public and private colleges and universities in eight states. Data were gathered during on-site semistructured interviews (approximately two per month) during the chair's first year and periodic telephone interviews. In addition, related material such as departmental memos, planning documents, newsletters, and program descriptions were collected. Analysis revealed that the beginning chairs experienced moderate to severe difficulty in making the transition into their new roles. Some of these difficulties stemmed from role conflict and/or role ambiguity experienced by the chairs. Two case studies are offered and analyzed to illustrate the six  problematic role changes reported by subjects: (1) from solitary to social, (2) from focused to fragmented, (3)from autonomy to accountability, (4) from manuscripts to memoranda, (5) from stability to mobility, and (6) from client to custodian. The paper concludes that beginning chairs should be provided with support, mentoring, and time- and stress-management workshops. In addition, chairs should be encouraged to implement the following \"balancing strategies\": restructure the problem, purge unnecessary \"adminstrivia,\" reverse the hierarchy, protect scholarship interests, and train for leadership.

RAP is a precollege program which aims to provide meaningful experiences in various aspects of health-related research for minority high school students and teachers. RAP activities are centered on the assignment of students to faculty preceptors/mentors during eight weeks in the summer. Participants work as full-time apprentices and participate in various career development activities, including maintaining a written record of their experience, conducting a research project in their assigned health area, and participating in a science fair. Data on 54 former participants were collected concerning the precollege  program experience, student background characteristics, and individual factors (such as academic ability, personality, and motivation). Of the respondents, 37 (68 percent) had chosen to pursue a health profession immediately following high school, and 17 percent (32 percent) had decided not to pursue a health professional immediately following high school. Analysis indicated that personality, cognitive, and motivational factors, along with family characteristics, experiential learning, socioeconomic status, and the RAP program had a significant impact on the career decision-making process of these students.

        "description":"This brief paper addresses two important challenges for colleges and universities as the 20th century closes. First, the dilemma of how to remain competitive through technology without excessive commercialization of educational programs and services. Currently, both the critics and the proposed remedies usually come from the business world, which sees the institution of higher learning as a form of business corporation that requires corporate strategies and tactics. The second challenge comes from rapid cultural change and conflicts between ideologies. More important than perceived conflict between scientists and scholars is the conflict between academic values or traditions and corporate values or ethics. American universities are being homogenized by corporate bureaucratization  and reason is no longer the university's organizing principle. In meeting the challenges of technological and cultural change, the nation should protect the its investment in its institutions of higher education and should rethink the investments made by the university's major constituencies, including faculty, professional staff, students, and alumni. Above all, universities must work to adapt and use technological innovation more effectively for educational purposes and to renew and enhance the human capital investments unique to their mission.

Section 2 identifies the common denominators of the grant project case histories, noting not only the most noteworthy formative changes at specific institutions but also general approaches that seem to work in almost any type of institution. Section 3 focuses on the six most important issues with  which the grantee institutions chose to grapple: (1) learning and assessment, (2) redefining scholarship, (3) faculty development, (4) faculty evaluation and rewards, (5) collegial governance, and (6) instructional technology. Section 4 summarizes practices (theoretical, process, and application) which have proven to be most effective for successfully addressing the issues undertaken.

Women hold 47 percent of part-time positions. This paper charges that the growing use of part-time and nontenure-track faculty is linked to a national crisis in support for liberal arts education and the increasing demand for technology education. Money in college budgets once available for the humanities has been siphoned off to sustain research programs built with federal dollars but now facing cuts in federal funding. Additionally, state legislatures are requiring their higher education institutions to more directly serve the business world. Because these patterns threaten the integrity of  university research funding, it forces the humanities to compete with the sciences for a share of a tighter budget. With most of the observable trends in higher education moving in the direction of responding to the demands of business, new technology, distance education, and building partnerships with nonacademic communities, the humanities and the centrality of classroom teaching are being side-stepped.

Increases in room and board rates have moderated as well, with average increases at 4.1 percent. Also noted is the shift from state appropriations to tuition as a revenue source, causing a significant increase in the ratio of average tuition and fees to median family income over the last thirty years, and a projection that this ratio will rise further in the next twenty  years. Financial aid available to postsecondary students rose as well by 6.2 percent to $60.5 billion in 1997-98.

The report examines the historical context in which this review took place, and discusses such issues as recruitment and retention, market equity, salary compression, faculty distribution, current practices of other state  colleges and universities; and years of service. The study found that most faculty comments toward current pay scale were unfavorable; faculty also responded negatively to questions about state allocations of funds for higher education. Appended is a faculty salary schedule covering instructors and assistant professors and a year-of-service chart. Two new faculty pay scale proposals are also presented to the UVSC faculty senate for consideration. (CH)",

This digest reviews five major higher education learning community models currently in existence: (1) Linked courses, which link cohorts of students taking two courses in common with one course typically content-based and the other application-based. Faculty in each course may teach independently or together; (2) learning clusters where instead of linking two courses together, a student cohort is linked in three or four courses, which often serve as the students' entire course load; (3) freshmen interest groups (FIGs), which are linked around academic majors and include a peer-advising  component that allows students to discuss course work and other college adjustment problems. Faculty play a lesser role in FIGs; (4) federated learning communities, the most complex of the models, in which a cohort of students takes three theme-based courses in addition to a three-credit seminar taught by a Master Learner a professor from a different discipline who takes the courses and fulfills all class requirements along with the students; and (5) coordinated studies, in which faculty and students participate in full-time active learning based on an interdisciplinary theme.

The digest examines the literature on campus climate for racial/ethnic diversity, looks at the impact on student diversity of the campus climate, and examines institutional changes necessary to improve the racial/ethnic diversity and enhance the learning environment. These issues are examined within a framework that encompasses theories of race relations and racial attitudes, historical legacies of exclusion, and campus behaviors both inside and outside the classroom, as well as changes in government and policy and forces of sociohistorical changes in U.S. society. The  needed fundamental institutional changes would include a conceptual shift in thinking about diversity and about an institution's overall teaching and learning priorities, in addition to structural changes that would allow for increased interaction and involvement among students from diverse backgrounds.

Questionnaires were designed to measure concept learning and reaction to medium of presentation. Results indicated that students perceived strong learning outcomes from online materials and mediated modes of education. Ease of access to online materials was also assessed. Online learning was perceived to be enjoyable, interesting, and productive of desirable pedagogical outcomes such as concept learning and application.

With distance learning classes, teachers are faced with a unique set of problems in supplying this outside support. Students are often spread over large geographical areas and have varying schedules due to work and family considerations. This paper covers the following hardware and software tools that can help to overcome these problems: (1) e-mail, including its use for communication between instructors and students, distribution of syllabi, and turning in of assignments; (2) electronic mailing lists, especially those managed by list-processing software, as a means of asynchronous class discussion; (3) computer conferencing,  including requirements and software options; (4) World Wide Web services, including posting/downloading files, graphics, and other multimedia materials; (5) audio and video materials via the Internet, including recording and storing audio/video, the ability to broadcast audio, and video teleconferencing; (6) other Internet services, including InterRelay Chat, MOOs, and MUDs, and online content-delivery servers; and (7) telephone-based technology, including voice mail, telephone conferencing, and fax services. Problems to consider, including availability of hardware/software, access control, Internet access, copyright issues, training, and costs, are noted. (Author/DLS)",

The study also examined student attitudes toward enrolling in future ITV courses. The sample was made up of all developmental students enrolled in an introductory algebra or an intermediate algebra course at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) taught via ITV during seven consecutive semesters, and developmental algebra students at ETSU enrolled in the instructor's traditional classrooms during these same semesters. Students were given math  instruction by the same instructor at one of three sites: the host site, the remote site, and the traditional classroom. Students' numerical final grades were used as a dependent variable in determining the effectiveness of these ITV courses. A two-way analysis of variance with one covariate (ANCOVA) was used to determine if differences in student achievement existed among the three instructional sites. Results give empirical evidence that ITV should be considered as an adequate method of providing developmental algebra instruction beyond the campus. Questions for futures studies are listed. (DLS)",

        "description":"During the 1996-97 academic year, a Principles of Management course was taught at Eastern Oregon State College to an on-campus group of juniors, using multiple technologies. The Internet was used as a source for print materials, resources, and research sites, and as a primary information dissemination medium. Electronic mail and listservs were utilized to establish, develop, and maintain asynchronous conferences and conferencing discussion of course materials. The course was designed to utilize the strengths of a number of media while avoiding their accompanying weaknesses. This paper begins with a review of the potential of computer conferencing. The course design is described in the second section, including organization of Internet materials, use of e-mail for conversation,  use of listservs for group discussion, student portfolios, and grading. Student reaction to the course is discussed in the next section, focusing on results of a student survey that assessed effort required, communication with peers, class participation, the class environment, the technology, and the level of learning. The fourth section addresses instructor reaction to the course, including level of effort required, communications, and level of interaction. (MES)",

        "description":"The &quot;discovery and conquest&quot; of the Internet and its application to the teaching of foreign languages and cultures has created some very serious pedagogical problems. The interest in instructional technology appeared on the horizon at a moment when theorists of foreign language acquisition were promoting notions of proficiency-oriented and interactive teaching for cross-cultural communication. The digital realms of the Internet, the World Wide Web, CD-ROM, and network-based communications should immerse students in task-driven cultural studies. This field of expansion has presented a dilemma to foreign language teachers, who have had to face the issue of proper contextualization of these activities. Digital technologies can promote a more student-focused environment only if the  teacher examines what is happening in the classroom before the addition of the use of any of the computer technologies. The World Wide Web as properly applied in this effort provides quick and unrestricted access to authentic materials in the form of text, sound, and images. Topics addressed in this paper include: the role of instructional technology in the foreign language classroom; CD-ROM, the Web, and network-based communication technologies; and the importance of communication in the classroom. A compilation of Web sites useful in the foreign language classroom is included. (Author/MES)",

The middle school students and teacher became quite interested in this activity. These students were reading and writing even though their tested reading levels were far below grade level. This report illustrates challenges and opportunities that arise when new technologies are used for teaching reading and writing and illustrates one way that technology was allowed to play a role in faculty development and training. If it were not for the existence of a differentiated faculty development and professional performance appraisal system for  the middle school teachers, it is unlikely that either the teacher or the class would have gone online. Moreover, without technical assistance from one of the students in the class (who was a hacker), this online adventure would never have gotten off the drawing board. This paper describes a way that was found to address questions over who will train teachers and how time can be found for teachers to learn to use technology to support their teaching and their students' learning.

        "author":["Crossman, William"],
        "description":"In the 21st century, VIVOs (voice-in/voice-out computers using visual displays but no text) will make written language obsolete. Written language is essentially a technology created 6,000 to 10,000 years ago for storing and retrieving information. VIVOs will perform this same function more easily, efficiently, and universally without requiring people to learn to read and write. There will be no compelling reason for schools to teach literacy skills. By 2050, the electronically-developed nations will become oral cultures; by 2150, a worldwide oral culture will be in place. Today's push to develop VIVOs is a further step in the human evolutionary drive to move past written language's limits and return to the biogenetic, oral-aural, pre-alphabetic roots of human communication and  information storage. Young people's choosing television, telephone, stereo, and computer games over books, letter-writing--and the resulting literary crisis that engulfs schools--is not the result of mental laziness or poor schools, but is an irreversible symptom of this deeper evolutionary process. VIVOs will transform every area of human activity in the 21st century, including education, the arts, human relations, politics, and business. Billions of nonliterate people, using VIVOs, will finally be able to access the world's stored information--if they can gain access to VIVOs. Access to VIVO technology looms as a key human rights issue of the 21st Century. (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"The problem addressed in this practicum was that most teachers at the author's middle school were not fully using the school's network resources in their day-to-day classroom activities, in spite of district technology initiatives. The goal of the practicum was to empower a cadre of representative mentor teachers to fully utilize the school network capabilities to engage in and help others engage in non-traditional classroom learning activities using a variety of new technology resources. Based upon the results of a faculty questionnaire and of a review of the research literature, this problem was addressed by offering a network training graduate course, combining face-to-face sessions with distance education sessions, to a group of teachers at the school. These teachers would in  turn be expected to share their training with fellow teachers. All 15 participants in the course made measurable progress with their networking skills and met the course goals in broad terms, but not all anticipated outcomes of the practicum were completely met. The researcher determined that this was due to the fact that some teachers in the class did not have the intended entry level skills, as well as to an organizational systems problem. Appendices include two general faculty questionnaires, the course syllabus, grading template, handouts, and the course evaluation questionnaire. (Contains 55 references.) (Author/AEF)",

The Board also coordinates with the Department of Administration (DOA) and the Public Service Commission to operate a telecommunications access program. In addition, the Board coordinates with DOA to provide infrastructure loans, technology purchasing services, technical assistance, and educational technology services, equipment, and training to eligible educational institutions. The TEACH Board was also  responsible for closing out the pioneering partners education technology grant and loan program. Institutions served by Board programs include school districts, private schools, cooperative education service agencies, technical colleges, private colleges, the University of Wisconsin system, and public libraries.

In the fall of 1998, a pilot program was introduced in two senior high schools in Alberta, using Authorware Professional (version 4.0.3) to teach introductory programming. The working hypothesis of the approach was that, by learning beginning programming using Authorware, students would master fundamental  logic and procedures quickly by means of the iconic interface. The program of study involved six beginning assignments derived and adapted from a laboratory manual used with fourth-year university undergraduates. Teachers using this approach reported that most students reacted to the program enthusiastically and favorably and that most of the students from the introductory course continued with intermediate-level courses. There are two main obstacles impeding use of Authorware in schools--its cost and the fact that most teachers are ignorant of what it can do. (AEF)",

Ninth-grade students' academic achievement in each of four different subject areas (algebra, biology, world cultures, and English) was studied. Two separate treatments were investigated. The first treatment exposed one group of students to a teacher-teamed approach for these subjects using a four-period block schedule. The second treatment exposed another group of students to a combination of the same teacher-teamed approach combined with significantly improved access to computer and telecommunications technology in the school and at the participating teachers' and students' homes. A control group  received the standard curriculum for these four subjects without any special accommodations for either teacher teaming or technology access. Results showed that students in the team taught group achieved higher GPAs than either the traditional school group or the group having both teacher teams and computer technology. Interviews with participating teachers uncovered impediments to the application of the computer technology. Two tables show mean excused/unexcused absences and mean grades for each subject area.

Certain experiences (e.g., installing and configuring new software, training students to use the software, and back-up methods of instruction) were anticipated, while others had to be dealt with &quot;on the fly&quot; (e.g., incompatible hardware, Internet propagation delays, and synchronizing audio and video). Instructors contemplating this mode of content delivery need to be aware of the  benefits and costs, especially in terms of time for instructor and student training, multiple modality and error-alternative preparation, and practice. The following conclusions are presented: (1) instructors and students need a lot of time to become familiar with the technology; (2) instructors need to plan for the unexpected and have alternative and backup methods for delivering course content; (3) instructors need to create multiple/repetitive modes of content delivery; and (4) instructors and students need to be relatively technically savvy as well as highly fault tolerant.

        "description":"This paper summarizes a quantitative synthesis of studies of the effectiveness of interactive distance education using videoconferencing and telecommunications for K-12 academic achievement. Effect sizes for 19 experimental and quasi-experimental studies including 929 student participants were analyzed across sample characteristics, study methods, learning environment, learner attributes, and technological characteristics. The overall mean effect size was 0.147, a small positive effect in favor of distance education. Effect sizes were more positive for interactive distance education programs that combine an individualized approach with traditional classroom instruction. Programs including instruction delivered via telecommunications, enhancement of classroom learning, short  duration, and small groups yielded larger effect sizes than programs using videoconferencing, primary instruction via distance, long duration, and large groups. Studies of distance education for all academic content areas except foreign language resulted in positive effect sizes. This synthesis supports the use of interactive distance education to complement, enhance, and expand education options, because distance education can be expected to result in achievement at least comparable to traditional instruction in most academic circumstances. A list of the studies is appended. (Contains 59 references.) (Author/AEF)",

        "description":"In order to assess the current presence of computing technology in American schools, a national survey was conducted of elementary and secondary principals and technology coordinators in 655 public and private schools. Results are discussed in terms of: computer density; computer capacity; computer renewal; peripherals; computer location; technology-intensive schools; software; and Internet access, including type of access and Internet penetration. Distributions and disparities of technology presence indicators are then examined in terms of the following background categories: school level; public versus private schools; size of enrollment; percent of minority enrollment; student poverty (Chapter 1 eligible); community income (zip code based); metropolitan status; and region. The  study concludes that the state of computing capacity for instruction in the nation's schools has improved dramatically in the past six years. Findings also indicate some major deficiencies. Most of the computers in schools do not have the capability to run the large variety of multimedia software currently available, which means the computers are also severely limited in how they can access graphical information on the Internet. Data also provide evidence that disparities still exist across social, economic, and geographic boundaries. In addition to 12 statistical tables in the text, appendices contain 22 figures illustrating findings. (AEF)",

However, the current modes of dissemination through journals and papers are often written for the expert community. The Telematics Centre at the University of Exeter (United Kingdom), School of Education provides creative solutions for the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and business. This paper describes an online embryonic version of the ICT Educational Research Forum (ERF), an Internet-based research center that is located within the United Kingdom's Virtual Teacher Center. The functions of the ERF are organized as a series of rooms with a menu bar alongside: the foyer where participants enter and are introduced to the resources  available to them; the seminar room where researchers may be heard speaking; and a desk which provides access to a wide range of resources, tools, and data sets. The embryonic version of the ERF contains online and paper copies of a feedback form. The paper also provides a preliminary analysis of the evaluation data from the ICT Educational Research Center to examine if it is effectively disseminating research on educational technology to the less expert user, i.e., the teacher.

Feedback in instruction can be described in terms of the interaction of stimulus inputs and response outputs, an associationist perspective. Here the delta rule is applied to each instance that an input and an output likely interact; the delta rule is used to describe the direction and magnitude of increase or inhibition of each instance. The total effect for a type of feedback is then described by the combination of the instances that make up that type. The findings of this investigation may provide seminal foundations for understanding feedback effects. The paper focuses on the following topics: an overview of the connectionist approach; implications of  lesson item difficulty; delta rule calculations for immediate and delayed feedback; and implications. Several graphs and mathematical calculations illustrate the discussion. (Author/AEF)",

Second generation computers have evolved as far as technology will allow. At the present time, the technology itself is the driving force behind the production of computers. Computers are being built for the technologists who favor the expansions of technology over ease of use. This phenomenon is described as the period of innovators, followed by early adopters (the first generation of users), late adopters, and laggards/skeptics. Educators belong to the late adopter category; due to high cost, little technological support, and inadequate strategies for integration, schools have  lagged behind business in computer implementation. An alternative to the limited number of prepackaged educational software programs is gaining access to the Internet. Examples of how teachers can incorporate the Internet into their classrooms include e-mail, global classrooms, ask-an-expert, information collection, online field trips, and electronic publishing. Until computers become invisible or incorporated into everyday life, the Internet is the medium which will promote fluid interaction between machine and students. (AEF)",

T3 Consortium partners included eight teacher training institutions across eight European countries. Together they researched and developed the infusion of telematics applications into courses, such that good practice with Telematics was modelled in teacher training. Over 6000 teachers and others were trained over the three years of the project. Courses for primary and secondary teachers of science, languages, technology and mathematics are now established within institutional programs, as well as courses for teacher trainers and library  staff. In addition, T3 has produced: (1) the T3 Centrum, an interlinked World Wide Web site, to improve access to courses, resources and research; (2) needs analyses for teacher trainers and librarians in the use of multi-media Telematics; (3) an exploitation plan that analyzes the worldwide market for telematics services in teacher training; and (4) research publications and dissemination activities that contribute to the preparation of the education profession's understanding of the information society. T3 has established innovative applications of Telematics in teaching and for good pedagogical practice through a network of user/researchers in universities across Europe. The incorporation of these research findings and the expertise of user/researchers into multidisciplinary research  projects to benefit education and training are recommended for future programs.

This study also focuses on the student as the customer who deserves access to the best technology available. It purports the notion that instructional technology is not limited to computers but includes any modernized method or device that assists classroom instruction in grade levels six through eight at Tapp. Data collected in this study indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between years of experience and experience with instructional technology. An analysis of subject responses indicates  that Tapp Middle School's faculty and staff needs to become familiar with windows based software, multimedia presentations, Internet, stand alone computer and network environments, multitasking, and office software packages. Several recommendations are provided and four exhibits include a staffing plan, bylaws, the instructional technology survey, and survey results. (AEF)",

        "description":"In 1995, the Lexington County, South Carolina School District 2 began implementing their &quot;Technology Task Force Position Statement&quot; for effectively incorporating technology into the curriculum. This transformed Springdale Elementary School's computer ownership from a few Apple II-E computers for the entire school to one with as many as four Pentium (TM) multimedia personal computers equipped with Internet access and color ink jet printer per class. Implementation began with the philosophy: (1) technology should support district educational goals, (2) technology should provide a platform for student access and advancement in curricular areas, (3) students, faculty members and staff should communicate effectively with each other and enhance information accessibility, (4) the  appropriate use of technology should become an integral part of the curriculum, (5) schools should prepare students for the 'world of work' that is driven by technology, and (6) minimum technology standards should be developed for all district schools. This paper describes the roles of managing and implementing this technology change as played by principal, vice principal, media specialist, teachers and students. Also outlines how parents and the community can benefit from the implementation and integration of technology. Basic objectives and principles for effective technology implementation are listed in the conclusion. (AEF)",

        "description":"Since the popularization of networked computing that began in 1993, many excited educators have employed networked computers to improve motivation and learning in the classroom. Computers have also become a focal point for the improvement of instruction through the introduction of teaching methods that better support constructivist learning. While there is a growing consensus that computers can be an effective tool for talented teachers, little is known about the deeper effects of educational computing on children and their families when computer use is pervasive and family access at home is cost-free. This paper reports some of the results of a long-term study of families and students who have had immersive exposure to network-based educational computing in a constructivist  classroom, starting in the 5th grade.

        "author":["Inoue, Yukiko"],
        "description":"Virtual reality (VR) is a new computational paradigm that redefines the interface between human and computer. VR may result in a significant improvement over traditional instruction because it is not only a multimedia interactive tool but also a learning environment extremely close to reality. Few empirical studies have been done on the use of VR as compared to that of other computerized or noncomputerized educational tools. It is necessary to examine VR both in different scenarios and for different applications in learning and teaching. The evaluation plan reported in this paper addresses the effect of VR support as compared to that of video support in tenth graders' learning of world geography. Videos are popular in world geography classes but may not be as effective as VR  because they are two-dimensional and passive. One world geography class selected for this experiment is composed of five units. A rotation of the treatment is used: each group uses VR for two units and videos for two units; in addition, one unit is optional for every student. To determine: (1) the effect of VR support, administer competency tests, (2) student attitudinal responses toward VR, students complete survey and interview, and(3)tendency of returning to VR, students opt to attend VR lab with attendance taken. Results have implications for the design and implementation of VR support in school curricula. The student questionnaire is appended. (Author/AEF)",

In this case, the digitization process was designed to serve a group of scholars already at work on a publication series, and so distinguishes itself from many others by its focus on the scholarly communication process rather than on giving broad access to collections through the Internet. The paper discusses the many reasons that a special collections library might undertake a digital conversion program, and shares the staff's insights into how digital technology has found its place in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Specifically, the  paper discusses: background on the library and the Boswell collection; project origins; forming a digitization strategy, including choices regarding where the library should place its emphasis; getting the project underway; the scanning process; results and benefits for the library; results and benefits for the scholar-editors; and conclusions.

The paper gives an overview of the preservation and management of research collections and describes the context in which decisions are made by researchers and librarians about what to preserve and how. By examining how librarians and scholars grappled with the first great crisis in the preservation of library materials--the pandemic loss of information printed on embrittled acid paper--it traces the development of the current consensus on how to manage large collections recorded on many media of varying stability. Highlights include permanent paper, paper deacidification, the rationale for reformatting, the scope of the problem, and local responsibilities vs. national  priorities. The need for a national preservation plan is discussed, as well as selection of materials for the national plan and the role of scholars in selection. The paper also addresses the problem that, despite striking progress made in preservation technology and management, the difficulties of preserving original library materials have scarcely diminished over time and demand the same thoughtful cooperation between scholars and librarians as they enter the 21st century as the brittle-book problem received in the 1980s.

All lessons are planned for 2 to 2.5 hours of class time. Most of the lessons can be taught separately and in any sequence, depending on the interests and needs of the participants. Each lesson includes: (1) objectives; (2) instructional materials (activity worksheets, booklets, video tapes); (3) suggested time and sequence for presenting the  lesson; (4) subject matter for background information and discussion; and (5) answers to activities and/or discussions. A variety of teaching strategies are discussed, including information sharing, group discussion, activity, and audio-visual support.

        "author":["High, Clennis F."],
        "description":"Due to their more diverse populations, urban colleges have different concerns than suburban and rural colleges, and they must provide programs and services specific to those concerns. The question arises as to whether urban college effectiveness can be measured with traditional indicators. The declining test scores in American public schools have led to the concept of &quot;accountability&quot; for performance levels, but the paper proposes that other factors also be included in the evaluation of community colleges, since so many of their students have non-degree objectives. All attendees at three Texas urban colleges are studied, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What are the major reasons students attend urban community colleges? (2) Do these reasons differ among the three  colleges studied? and (3) Are there any evaluative factors that should be, but are not, used for these colleges? Results show that 64% of the students were not enrolled in a degree-seeking or academic track, and the largest number of these students, 19% of the total sample, were there for short-term work-related training. Neither sex nor ethnicity were found to be a factor in whether students chose a degree-seeking or non-degree track. The paper suggests that academia needs to recognize this lack of interest in academic credential by many students, and evaluate college performance accordingly. Contains 13 references. (VF)",

        "description":"This report calls for continual self-evaluation of community colleges to ensure that educational objectives--including knowledge, skills and attitudinal goals--are being met. Faculty and curriculum development must be ongoing, although there is debate over whether it should be proactive or reactive regarding societal changes. Whichever philosophy is adopted, updates through quality approaches in inservice education are essential, and this paper outlines possible methods of faculty improvement. Community college instructors should facilitate creative thought among their students and colleagues, and offers methods for improving instructor performance, such as video taping classes, observing fellow instructors, and viewing video tapes on providing vocational training. Improvements  needed in colleges include the use of technology, the use of interactive media, the education and assistance for students of all cultures and disabilities, and transformational quality and leadership. Suggestions include instructors periodically forming committees and divisional meetings to determine if their syllabi need revising and to determine the core content for each discipline. From these core contents arise statements of objectives, which become increasingly complex as the students progress. Communication between public schools and community colleges would facilitate the transition from one framework to the other. Contains 20 references. (VF)",

The 1997-98 survey identifies graduates' current activities, determines the extent to which these activities are related to the graduates' educational programs, offers information to be used as tools in career awareness and planning, and provides data to facilitate program evaluation and development. A total of 15,646 Wisconsin technical college graduates were surveyed statewide, with 12,830 participants (82%) responding. The majority of respondents, 46%, said their reason for attending a technical college was to prepare for employment, while 21% said it was to make a career change. The  remaining 33% were divided in their motivations for technical training among personal interests, preparing for continuing education, improving job skills, and miscellaneous reasons. Findings indicate that 97% of the graduates were satisfied or very satisfied with their training, 96% are employed; 90% are employed in Wisconsin; and 83% obtained employment in occupations related to their training. The survey also includes median annual salaries by instructional division, with data divided according to the following categories: technical ($28,000); service ($25,200); industrial ($24,022); marketing ($23,778); health ($21,948); business ($21,838); graphics (20,798); agribusiness ($19,758); and home economics ($16,379).

A final sample of 26 MIST interns and second-year students from the School of Architecture at the University of Hawaii-Manoa returned surveys that asked questions about the usefulness of the MIST program. Descriptive statistics regarding respondent characteristics (such as major, number of units completed, and continuing student status) and the helpfulness of MIST and training were used as the primary analyses. Respondents indicated  that MIST training was very helpful in training them for a new position, and helpful in training them to better perform a current job. In general, respondents rated the offered financial support as helpful. Respondents also indicated that interns used the training in the home as well as work environments. It is concluded that based on the high level of participant regard and applicability to career and home, that the expansion and continuation of MIST should be supported. (SKF)",

The paper asserts that while the boundaries of higher education have blurred in terms of physical buildings; the characteristics of students interested in higher education; the curricular offerings of high schools, community colleges, and universities; and the purposes of higher education institutions; a core purpose that involves enabling society to develop and maintain an understanding of itself and the world remains. Three areas of change for continuing education are suggested: examining and following the customer (student) care models effectively used by for-profit and corporate universities; more deeply examining the nature of knowledge; and making more explicit to students the  academic mode of thinking are recounted. The four-pronged model of distance learning used by the Open University in order to illustrate the implications of incorporating change on individual students, the community and society is cited. It is concluded that by providing flexible, quality and low-cost education, mega-universities (that follow the distance learning model) are the institutions that will lead the future of university education.

The spring 1997 issue discusses the &quot;town vs. gown&quot; conflict, which entails trustees balancing their obligations to operate the college on behalf of the community with the need to earn the respect and support of the faculty and administrators. The spring issue also advocates trustees as the community college officials most suitable to maintain relations with the California Assembly, Senate, and federal government. In summer 1997, Board Focus talks about trustee rights and responsibilities, the dynamics between trustees and district CEOs, and the participation of trustees in regional  institutional accreditation. Fall 1997 Board Focus looks at civility and conflict in the boardroom, the role of student trustees in offering important insights on district mission, and the pros and cons of odd or even election years. In Spring 1998, the publication discusses board development as it relates to the public's increased demand for institutional accountability. Also included is an article on campaign finance and community colleges, with a discussion on the impact of Proposition 208 on the nature of campaign funding. Spring 1998's issue contains a survey, intended for reader response, regarding actions taken by various school boards to foster board and trustee education.

While research has found that most faculty experience stress as a result of workload, publishing pressures, and insufficient salaries, this study asserts that some faculty experience an additional dimension of stress as a result of necessary participation in college governance. Data for this study were derived from the National Data Base on Faculty Involvement in Governance (NDBFIG), an ongoing five-year study of faculty involvement in governance sponsored by the University of Alabama. A total of 83 community college faculty governance unit leaders (FGUs) and 76 research and doctoral university FGUs responded to a survey in 1998 constructed around the theme of  faculty governance and stress. In general, both groups of faculty rated the level of stress factors similarly. However, analysis revealed that community college faculty rated obtaining program and financial approval as the greatest stressor, while research university faculty rated making decisions that affect others as the highest stressor. Overall, faculty governance leaders were identified as individuals whose perceptions and beliefs varied in regard to their roles in leadership and the factors that cause stress in the position of leadership.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the proper procedures that must be followed in the dismissal of tenured faculty at a technical community college. While many resources on motivating and managing employees exist, little information is available pertaining to strategies for coping with unsatisfactory instructors who are unresponsive to counseling initiatives. Using a fictional case study as example, this study defines the types of procedures and documentation necessary to dismiss a tenured faculty member for incompetence at Renton Technical College (WA). The termination of a non-tenured instructor's contracts is relatively straightforward, but the process for a tenured instructor is more complicated. Model vignettes between a fictional administrator, unsatisfactory  faculty member and union representative are constructed in accordance with Frederick Hertzberg's Motivator-Hygiene theory and Renton Technical College's Tenure Review Committee Handbook. The resulting protocol suggests a multiple phase process in which the outcome is dependent on the decisions and behaviors of the instructor and administrator at each stage. The instructor is counseled, behavior is documented, a de-hiring proposal is developed and, if necessary, a written report is submitted to the tenure review committee and the College's Board of Trustees.

From this experience, the Board of Directors formed a governance strategy of policy and procedure development described as &quot;eclectic.&quot; This approach encourages outward vision, strategic leadership, group responsibilities, a clear distinction between Board and CEO role, and diversity in viewpoints of constructive dissent. In accordance, the Board Committees are structured to reflect a policy-oriented Board of Directors in which a structured business plan approach outlines how SIAST plans to achieve the goals of the Saskatchewan Training  Strategy. The paper also advocates the development of governance practices grounded in experience and field research. It is asserted that in areas such as organizational governance, the process of reflection in action and the communication between directors as they study best practices is a professional development strategy with significant potential to assist current and future leadership in colleges.

        "description":"This study examines the factors influencing faculty perceptions of mission and organizational culture within community colleges. Using Cameron and Ettington's organizational culture typology, the investigation focused on how faculty in a single state system perceived different cultural types and mission in describing their particular campuses. The four culture type models explored were clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and market. Individual demographics were also investigated to determine whether they affected perceptions about culture and mission. A survey instrument developed specifically for this study was sent to 660 full-time instructional faculty at seven community college campuses and yielded a return rate of 56 percent. A multiple discriminant analysis of faculty perceptions  of culture types correctly placed 40 percent of faculty in their appropriate campuses, suggesting considerable agreement within campuses about their institution's cultures. The additions of variables such as institutional mission and academic or vocational affiliation added accuracy to a total of 54 percent. This accuracy in correctly classifying faculty suggests that culture, mission and disciplinary affiliation all contribute to the uniqueness of the campus. Conversely, the inability to classify 46 percent of faculty was likely due to shared cultural aspects among campuses (market outlook, college transfer mission). Implications and future research are discussed. The survey instrument and table of findings are appended. Contains 94 references. (Author/SKF)",

According to the paper, this approach bases curriculum design, content, delivery and assessment on the application and integration of knowledge, skills and values -- a comprehensiveness that is not achieved with a competency approach. The report also discusses learning outcomes in terms of: (1) assessment, stressing the need for \"authentic assessment,\" which simulates real world situations; (2) generic abilities, including research and learning strategies, critical thinking, and communication; (3) the various disciplines, including the impact of outcomes on the transfer process for receiving and sending institutions; and (4) faculty concerns over the imposition of a business or industrial model on  higher education. The learning outcomes approach may be contrasted against traditional academic approaches by its emphasis on determining curriculum on the basis of: (1) what students need to know, as determined by student and societal needs; (2) what students should be able to do; and (3) what generic abilities should be developed and assessed. The report suggests that learning outcomes should be the based on broad analysis of the long-term needs and social responsibilities of students, which in turn forms the basis for determining curricula.

In addition to newly created jobs and the development of more than 167 distance courses, the province has reaped the following benefits from its participation in the program: (1) an increased accessibility to learning opportunities; (2) opportunities to develop multimedia distance learning software; (3) national and international attention; and (4) learning industry contacts outside the province. After the program, PDF recipients evaluated the experience to identify problems and  possible improvements. Most problems identified were those of product development, which were due to poor finances, a heavy workload, and administrative problems. Among the recommendations that recipients offered were (1) developers should create and follow a comprehensive business plan and a marketing strategy; (2) team commitment is essential; and (3) enough time should be allowed to overcome technological obstacles. The majority of recipients reported being satisfied with the program procedures and recommend the same form be used in future projects, although some felt that more focus was needed on exportable, possibly profitable projects.

Thirty-four persons participated in the dialogue, including 31 Deans, Vice-Presidents of Instruction or Students, and Presidents; and 3 faculty members. Participants were asked to respond to questions regarding obstacles and successes of faculty evaluation at their respective institutions. Prior research on the topic provided information on the key elements of an effective evaluation and faculty buy-in. These components were compared against the comments of the forum participants. Among the obstacles cited were the timing in which evaluation took place, lack of trust in the system and administrators, lack of financial  resources to conduct proper evaluation, and lack of administrative training in interpreting the results of evaluation. Participants also gave examples of evaluation successes, such as open dialog between faculty and administrators, perceptions by faculty of evaluation as an opportunity to grow and develop professionally, and an integration of the evaluation process into the organization's ethos. It is concluded that while barriers to effective evaluation do exist, the examples of success indicate that the practice is evolving. (SKF)",

The initiative, which sought to remedy the latter report's limited attention to global education in community colleges, consisted of three phases. In the first phase, the nearly 200 member institutions of the American Council on International Intercultural Education and Community Colleges for International Development were surveyed in Fall 1998 about perceived obstacles and solutions concerning globalization efforts in community colleges. In the second phase, a hearing was held to report the survey results  and to provide a forum for testimony from, and discussion among, community college presidents, federal agents and NGO personnel. In the third phase, fifteen community college leaders met at Airlie Center to discuss the impact of global education on access and equity, the faculty role, finances, governance, leadership development, market forces, student needs, technology, teaching and learning, and the civic role. They synthesized the survey results, earlier discussions, and their own vision into this report, which emphasizes that community and technical colleges will serve as the vanguard for global education into the next century. The survey instrument and transcripts of the testimony given by 12 individuals are appended. (VF)",

The article emphasizes the limited awareness of this transfer reciprocity, both on part of the general public and of policymakers. Cited are the results of a 1998 study that uncovered the existence of multiple transfer patterns. While 52% of the students followed the \"typical\" transfer path, another 13% attended two community colleges before enrolling at the university, 22% attended a four-year school before enrolling in a community college and then a university, and 13% of the students followed a different pattern. In addition, 8% of the university students enrolled concurrently at  both a community college and a university. The article aims to communicate to policymakers the following points in understanding student transfer: (1) the transfer function or niche of community colleges is a complex function; and (2) the community college also serves students who already have a bachelor's degree or higher. To the general public, this article advises: (1) the two-year college is the transfer institution of choice for many students; and (2) attending a two-year college is a highly satisfactory experience for many students, including those students who have attended a four-year college.

The following suggestions are presented to instructors in order to facilitate optimal student learning in college English courses: (1) present content in a meaningful manner, with emphasis on clarifying relevant facts, concepts, and generalizations; (2) develop and maintain student interest by selecting activities that engage the learner; (3) enable students to perceive the purpose in learning, and develop the awareness that motivation can be intrinsic as well as extrinsic (in environmental sources, such as grading, peer recognition, and teacher approval); (4) make adequate provisions for individual differences in the classroom, as students vary in purposes, interest, and personal  goals. Another factor to consider in determining motivation is student involvement in extracurricular activities. A variety of methods should be used in the teaching of English, including a combination of lecturing, student input, discussion questions, established learning stations, reference materials, problem-solving, video-tapes with quality objectives, and testing in order to measure goal attainment. Meaning, understanding, and interest are all powerful factors in learning, and will determine the level of student achievement in the classroom. Contains 10 references. (AS)",

        "description":"In 1988, the Arizona Board of Regents, Legislature, and the State Board of Directors for Community Colleges approved an innovative partnership between Northern Arizona University (NAU) and Arizona Western College (AWC) in Yuma. The AWC/NAU partnership was designed to expand higher education opportunities in southwest Arizona. This document describes aspects of the partnership that contribute to its success, including: (1) cooperation in the development of campus services; (2) layering of campus services; (3) curricular articulation; (4) organizational reporting and management; (5) professional development; (6) operational agreements; (7) the Yuma K-20 consortium; and (8) fostering economic development. Under this partnership, AWC offers freshman and sophomore courses leading to  associate's degrees, and NAU in Yuma offers junior and senior courses leading to baccalaureate degrees, as well as graduate programs at the master's and doctoral levels. Instruction is offered using both traditional and distance learning modes. NAU and AWC share the same campus, which is a factor different from most other educational partnerships of this type. A new academic building and computer lab co-operated by NAU and AWC are the most recent examples of shared space facilitated by the partnership. In the 10 years that the partnership has been running, NAU/AWC has graduated over 1500 students in Yuma with NAU bachelor's or graduate degrees. (AS)",

        "description":"This presentation describes the entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial strategies being adopted by two Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutions in Australia, Northern Territory University and the Victoria University of Technology. The similarities are stressed between TAFE institutions, North American community and technical colleges, and Europe's vocational colleges, all of which meet the specific needs of industry, business, and the community. In addition, all three of these systems are currently facing funding cuts from government agencies; government-initiated policy changes; greater competition from both the public and private sector; and demographic shifts that are changing the composition of the student population. In response to these challenges, the TAFE  institutions have taken initiatives to maximize their competitive edge in the training market. Some of the entrepreneurial strategies adopted are: (1) establishing strategic alliances with key partners; (2) designing and delivering flexible training packages; (3) identifying industries where little structured vocational training has been implemented; and (4) delivering training services to clients off-shore. In addition, some intrapreneurial strategies have been designed and implemented to put each organization on a more business-like footing, including budgeting for staff development programs, investing in high-quality equipment, and building &quot;live work&quot; simulations into training programs. The authors conclude that the implementation of these business-like practices have had significant  short-term benefits in terms of enhanced budgets, physical resources, and staff skills. (CAK)",

        "description":"This paper presents two policy issues related to the topic of workforce preparation. While changes in the structures and requirement of jobs in the postwar economy have created a need for a more skilled workforce, at the same time, corporations have become increasingly reluctant to invest in training and education for youth and for their own employees. This study examines how such structural changes affect the skills required of workers and the extent to which firms help develop those skills. The authors conducted case studies to learn the corporate restructuring process, how the process impacted workforce skill levels and development, ways that firms developed the skill levels of their workers, and what the resulting implications are for skill development strategies and public  policy. The industries chosen for the study were insurance companies and the medical imaging equipment industry, representing service and manufacturing. Among the study's findings is that employers now hire on the basis of a person's ability to master a set of skills, rather than on the basis of existing skills. The study comes to the conclusion that encouraging community colleges to play a central role in workforce development poses perplexing issues. Demand-driven solutions for low-level workers and overall educational improvement strategies that depend on demand-side drivers may need to be carefully constructed and targeted rather than widely expanded as the natural extension of high school.

The foreword points out the importance of preparing employees for the demands of the &quot;knowledge-based&quot; economy, the role that Alabama's community colleges have played in workforce training, and Alabama's current low level of literacy and jobs per capita. The WIA provisions are as follows: (1) a state workforce investment board and a local workforce investment board should be established to assist the governor in developing policies and procedures; (2) local service  delivery areas should be established, taking into account the geographic service areas of local educational institutions, available resources, and the extent to which these areas are consistent with labor market areas; and (3) one-stop delivery systems should be established in each local area to provide activities such as welfare-to-work, veterans programs, and Title II adult education and literacy activities. Alabama has already made a substantial investment in workforce development through its system of two-year colleges, and the wisest use of workforce investment funds is the leveraging of this existing workforce infrastructure into a stronger, more efficient, permanent workforce training system.

The study was undertaken to obtain an historical perspective of remedial education in American community colleges and to review the research related to developmental mathematics course-taking in community colleges. The following topics are presented: (1) an introduction to developmental education, including a definition and the reasons for its importance; (2) a review of the literature on this subject; (3) the results of a field investigation, in which the researcher interviewed four developmental education specialists in the Illinois community college system; (4) general developmental mathematics  enrollment data for all Illinois community colleges; (5) a description of the developmental mathematics courses at Olney Central College; and (6) conclusions and recommendations. It is concluded that developmental education is an essential function of the community college if these institutions are to fulfill their mission as democratizing colleges, and that much more research is necessary to determine whether developmental education courses are effective in raising students' ability to college-level, enabling students to persist in their courses, and retaining students until they reach their educational objectives.

Data were collected using The Emergency Medical Training Technology Program Cost Questionnaire. In addition, data from examination results on the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT)-Advanced Level were analyzed. The data were analyzed and compared using descriptive statistics and correlation procedures. Results suggest that the cost per student contact hour of instruction was correlated with the number of laboratory hours, number of affiliated clinical instruction sites, number of  faculty members, faculty salaries, the age of the program, and attrition rates, but was not correlated with total enrollment, number of didactic and clinical hours of instruction, or expenditures for equipment. The first time pass rates on the National Registry of EMTs' Advanced Level examination were not correlated with the number of didactic or laboratory hours of instruction, but were correlated with the number of clinical instructional hours, the number of faculty and faculty salaries. It is recommended that emergency medical technology program staff become more knowledgeable regarding factors associated with program costs. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

A second objective was to analyze the successful and unsuccessful practices, particularly those relating to governance, structure, and training of staff. Data were collected using a survey designed for the study and interviews with writing directors at four of the Tennessee community colleges surveyed. Analysis revealed that community college writing centers in Tennessee vary in their primary clientele, with half providing  comprehensive services to all writers on campus, and the other half providing services to primarily developmental writers. Assumptions, practices and goals that are both unique and universal to community colleges in Tennessee are identified. It is concluded that while a fair amount of literature on writing centers has evolved during the last 20 years, it still fails to address the limitations presented by the unique community college environment such as admissions policies and part-time student populations.

        "description":"This digest discusses the challenges facing first-generation students, and offers strategies for helping them to transfer to four-year institutions. A first-generation community college student attends a community college, and his or her parents have not obtained a college degree. Large waves of immigration have affected community colleges; many of these incoming students who enter the higher education system experience difficult cultural transitions. Upward mobility is the primary goal of most of these full-time first-generation college students. Academic and social challenges are often compounded for first-generation students because of family resistance to cultural and academic acclimation, which alienates these students from family support and financial resources. The  struggle for first-generation students to transfer is intensified by the prevalence of poor academic preparation and low socioeconomic levels. First-generation students are often placed in vocational, technical, and/or remedial programs that impede their progress toward transfer. To increase the overall rate of transfer, enhanced counseling and advising services, as well as faculty advising, have been effective. At one college, enrollment of first generation students in Coordinated Studies Programs is also helpful in facilitating transfer. Clarification of current articulation agreements can ease the movement from two- to four-year colleges. As high-risk students, first-generation community college students require special attention, with strategies to work with that will facilitate  transfer. Contains 15 references. (AS)",

        "description":"In 1995, the State Board of Community and Technical Colleges in Washington forecasted that the number of students transferring from the two-year to the four-year sectors would flatten or even decline during the period from 1994 through 1998, and that the number of transfer students would rise by 50% from 1999 to 2010. This report reconfirms that projection. It also reviews the factors underlying that initial forecast, updates the forecast numbers, and provides a forecast of increasing transfer numbers through 2010. Information is included on the differences in current transfer patterns by institution, and the division of future enrollments is discussed. Alternative factors to those underlying the forecast may also impact transfer trends. The following details are presented: (1)  the decline in transfer numbers from 1993-94 through the present year are consistent with a drop in the number of students 19 to 23 years of age enrolled in the colleges two years earlier; (2) transfer numbers will begin to increase this coming year, and will exceed past levels in 2000-01; and (3) the number of transfer students will increase more than 50% in the next ten years. The increase will be spread throughout Washington, though the largest increases will be from the colleges that serve Snohomish and King Counties. Contains 9 tables. (AS)",

These colleges served 1,651 TRB workers in 1997-98, and 7,000 workers since the program inception in 1991. The report, based on data from college enrollment records and unemployment insurance system data, provides detailed information about the colleges' performance. The main findings reported are: (1) workers impacted by the downturn in natural resource jobs are able to return to employment after completing training, with 81% of TRB graduates obtaining employment; (2) workers are able to complete the training of their choice and find employment at prevailing wages, with the average TRB student entering new jobs at $10.80 per hour; (3) workers with low  educational attainment are able to enroll in basic skills training in preparation for completion of the equivalent of high school; and (4) workers are able to enroll in training programs for demand occupations requiring new skills. The report includes information on TRB student characteristics, industries of dislocation, wages and employment, and placement rates. Evidence supports the notion that community and technical college training for dislocated natural resource workers is relevant to the training needs of the state of Washington and to the workers in the program.

The new programs initiate a wage and skill progression strategy that gets WorkFirst students started in better jobs than they could find without training and helps them to advance in employment and earnings. WorkFirst training programs include: (1) tuition assistance; (2) pre-employment training, which is geared to specific employer hiring standards and targets employers ready to hire WorkFirst participants; (3) adult basic education and English as a Second Language for employers who have low-wage workers; and (4) literacy development that targets WorkFirst families with young, at-risk children to help parents gain literacy,  family management, and employability skills to prepare for work. General findings are that: (1) welfare FTE enrollments have fallen 58% since 1995; (2) for the first time, colleges are providing more training for past welfare recipients than for adults on welfare; (3) students this fall were more likely to attend part-time and in the evening than in past years; (4) only one-third of the welfare students were enrolled in occupational programs; the majority were looking for basic skills, personal development, or to remedial instruction; and (5) the majority of the students in the WorkFirst programs are low-income/low-wage earning adults.

The Worker Retraining program assures that jobless workers have immediate access to job retraining for a new career if they are not able to find work in their current field. It also builds the capacity of colleges to provide training in high-demand, high-wage fields. The program has served 33,387 unemployed and dislocated workers between 1993 and 1998 at the public colleges and 1,012 at 35 private career schools. Three major findings are reported: (1) the program is changing to reflect the changing face of job loss in Washington, that is, dislocated workers are less likely to come from manufacturing and more likely to be in service and  retail trades; (2) workers who participate in programs are finding good jobs at high salary levels; 83% of those who left the college have gained employment, with an average salary of $10.83 per hour in 1997; and (3) colleges are providing training that is responsive to the growing need for technology workers, especially for smaller firms, where most of today's economic growth is found.

        "description":"In fall 1996, Washington State developed a performance goals and indicators system in seven areas, including student retention, which is the focus of this report. Six indicators were developed for assessing student retention: (1) the percent of degree-seeking students who attend 4 or more quarters in a 2-year period; (2) percent of degree-seeking students who attend only one quarter and do not return in a 2-year period; (3) percent of students enrolled in a developmental class who progress to a college-level course in the same area; (4) number of credits taken in comparison to required courses; (5) percent of student graduating or completing within 3 years; and (6) hours completed by basic skills students. This report provides a review of the literature on student retention,  describing the study of retention from the perspectives of cultural passage and cost benefit calculation. Strategies for increasing student retention are presented, focusing on those that assure that students perceive that the benefits of training outweigh the perceived cost, and that reach out to connect students to the college culture early in the students' tenure. Recommended strategies include transition strategies, such as orientation and career planning, and integration strategies, such as coordinated studies programs and active learning. The remainder of the report presents the available evidence indicating that student retention in the Washington Community and Technical College System is below expectations. Appended is detailed information about student retention as measured  through the six indicators. (CAK)",

The Community College Student Experience Questionnaire (CCSEQ), an in-class survey administered to approximately 13,000 students at 25 participating colleges, asked students about their involvement in college courses and other campus activities, and their perceptions of the institutional climate. Responses indicated that students were 80% white, 7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 4% Hispanic, 2% African American, 2% Native American, and 4% &quot;Other Race.&quot; The data suggest that students of all race and ethnic groups experience college alike in the respect that they do not devote much time to their education and to other campus activities, yet they find the college a positive environment.  Students of color, however, were more likely to interact with faculty and other students and reported more academic gains and progress than their white counterparts. Some students of color, particularly African-American and Asian-American students, reported a less supportive institutional climate than whites experience. Figures 1-7 indicate amounts of time spent studying, student interaction, job or family obligations that interfere with college work, challenge levels of coursework, and perceptions of learning environment.

Overall, the system is having limited success in improving student progress and completion rates for students of color.

        "description":"In 1997, the Financial Aid Office Staff at Johnson County Community College (JCCC) in Kansas conducted a survey to gauge student satisfaction with the Student Financial Aid Office. Surveys mailed to 3,026 current and prospective JCCC students resulted in 299 usable responses. This report combines results for applicants for two types of financial aid (Federal and non-Federal), and also highlights the differences between each kind of award. Appended are the questionnaire and cover letter, as well as tabled survey results. Major findings are presented under headings including overall satisfaction, types of financial aid received, ratings of services and contacts, length of wait, student likes and dislikes, interest in scholarship search services, suggested improvements, and Federal  aid versus non-Federal aid applicants. In general, overall satisfaction, which averaged 3.8 on a 5-point scale, was seen as generally high but needing improvement. Six recommendations are made, including: (1) review phone procedures to decrease busy signals and waiting time; (2) continue to use modified &quot;triage&quot; procedures to help decrease time in line; (3) develop a comment card to monitor student satisfaction; (4) continue to refer students to free scholarship search web sites; (5) review the cost, staffing, and operational implications of offering additional limited evening hours; and (6) provide checklists to students detailing specific requirements and deadlines for various financial aid options.

The decision to move forward with the semester conversion was guided by the fact that collegiate research indicates that the semester system provides a superior environment for teaching and learning. This manual was designed to serve as a reference guide to the semester conversion, by providing information and examples that explain how the conversion will affect institutions, and to assist in the transition process on individual campuses. The manual identifies challenges and opportunities with regard to the following areas: (1) instruction, including class schedules, teaching loads, and  instructional programs and awards; (2) fiscal impacts for students, employees, and college operations; (3) student services, including the role of academic advisors and the impact on students; and (4) information services, including forms, files, personnel, and historical data. The report also contains surveys to be completed by students, faculty, staff, and administrators requesting their opinions about the conversion from a quarter system to a semester system. The report concludes with recommended policy revisions. (AS)",

        "description":"This report by the Chancellor of The Alabama College System provides recommendations to the governor for implementing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 in the state. The WIA consolidates and streamlines the federal role in adult and youth job training and adult and vocational education. Alabama high school graduates who were successful in high school are unlikely to have adequate computer and technical skills to compete for increasingly high-tech jobs in the global economy. The prospect of moving into the next century with fewer younger, better educated workers entering the workforce demands that a system be developed that can transform the fragmented training and employment programs into a coordinated information and service delivery system for individuals seeking jobs,  and for employers seeking more highly trained workers. Key elements of such a system include: (1) one-stop centers; (2) customer choice; (3) integration of services; and (4) performance-driven outcomes. Alabama's two-year colleges have been striving to accomplish the creation of such a network, and this effort has been tied to actions of state and national leaders. The WIA presents a number of opportunities for the Alabama College System to work cooperatively and constructively as an equal partner with other agencies in redefining and advancing the state's workforce development system as Alabama moves into the 21st century.

Results are presented for the following areas: (1) reasons for not enrolling; (2) financial concerns; (3) financial aid; (4) student services; (5) assessment and enrollment; (6) educational objectives; and (7) respondent profile. The main reasons cited for not enrolling are: financial concerns (23%), decision to attend another school (13%), work schedule conflicts (10%), too many other commitments or responsibilities (8%), and frustration with the enrollment process (6%). Fifty-three  percent of respondents indicated that financial concerns are very or somewhat important in their decision not to enroll. Of interest is the fact that only 19% applied for financial aid. In terms of student services, 25% of the respondents indicated they experienced a problem with the enrollment process, and 18% experienced some difficulty in trying to obtain financial aid. Sixty-two percent indicated they planned to enroll at JCCC in the future. The main educational objectives of these potential students are: (1) transfer (24%); (2) career change preparation (18%); (3) self-improvement or personal interest (16%); and (4) preparation for the job market (14%).

Findings indicate that three-quarters of the companies interviewed provided formal training for their employees during the past year. Most companies interviewed (88%) used their own employees as trainers. Over 150 different companies, organizations and institutions were cited by respondents as providers of formal training for companies surveyed, indicating that the training market for businesses in Johnson County is extremely fragmented. About  40% of the companies not using the JCCC Business and Industry Institute to train their employees do use outside companies to provide training for their employees. Two factors that were rated by companies as most important in selecting a provider of training were relevance of the subject matter and the trainer's experience in the field. While 60% of respondents were aware that JCCC provides noncredit training for businesses, less than half of these individuals are familiar with the training provided. Results imply that, although almost all respondents had heard of Johnson County Community College, name recognition does not automatically extend to awareness of JCCC as a provider of training for business. Significant additional communication, marketing, and advertising efforts are needed to  inform potential clients of business training services at JCCC.

        "description":"This dissertation examines the Office Technology curriculum, which prepares students for the secretarial field, at a community college in western Canada. The study also explores and compares the perceptions of students, instructors, employers and working secretaries regarding the role of the secretary, and looks at the influences that shape students' attitudes and beliefs about the secretarial field as they undergo secretarial training. The methodology used includes document analysis, observation, and interviews. Findings indicate that current tensions exist amongst the instructor, student, and business agendas due to discrepancies between the mechanist curriculum-as-planned and the experiential curriculum-as-lived. The study recommends that the Office Technology  curriculum-as-planned be altered to reflect the demands of the modern workplace, emphasizing cognitive skills such as analyzing, evaluating, and decision-making; interpersonal skills such as conflict resolution, cooperation, and coordination; and personal management skills such as self-confidence, integrity, accountability, and adaptability. The study also recommends that the Office Technology curriculum be strengthened by extending both its length and options that are open to its students. It is further suggested that ties to the business community be augmented through implementation of cooperative education programs and professional development opportunities for college staff.

The plan contains three main parts. First, that Alabama's two-year colleges will be organized to deliver high-quality, high-skill, accessible workforce education and training to Alabamians during the 21st century. This requires the 30 colleges to measure performance, teach skills that are demanded in the workforce, make training accessible throughout the state, place a high priority on adult education, and become technologically advanced. Second, Alabama's two-year colleges will maintain close and continuous  relationships with employers to ensure high-quality service. To this end, the colleges must understand the labor markets and skill requirements of employers and should create regional advisory councils to achieve the required relationship with employers. Third, Alabama's two-year colleges will work cooperatively with other employment and training agencies to enhance the development of Alabama's workforce. The Alabama Employment Service, the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs and The Alabama College System are all necessary to support the mission of workplace training. They should work together regionally, and with the governor, to improve coordination among local businesses, universities to achieve their goals. (AS)",

        "description":"This paper presents and evaluates different types of student assessment measures--including discussion-generating questions, multiple choice questions, essay questions, and authentic projects--for on-line courses. The paper asserts that assessment should mimic how students will be evaluated on the job site in the real world, meaning that they should be team members and problem solvers, with the technological and academic skills to communicate the results of their actions. The findings are based on the researcher's experience as the teacher of an Internet-delivered course, \"Earth Systems Science Approach to Physical Geography.\" The paper introduces the concept of \"authentic assessment,\" a process that requires that the evaluation be realistic and force the students to use  knowledge to solve real-world problems, which are often open-ended, poorly framed, and have no clear-cut answers. A scoring rubric, which provides the criteria for students to follow in order to receive a specified grade, is presented. Finally, the paper lists examples of the four assessment types, along with the goals, advantages, and disadvantages of each. It is concluded that on-line assessment of small Internet-based classes can be accomplished using many of the same assessment tools used in face-to-face classes. (CAK)",

The disciplines included in this report are: industrial manufacturing technology, corrosion technology, plastics technology, and metallurgical technology. Programs are evaluated in terms of need, cost-effectiveness, quality, and status. The report provides information regarding trends in manufacturing that have affected production occupations, including declining employment, increased international competition, and technological advances that have brought about changes in production techniques and management practices. The result has been a need for more broadly skilled  workers who can function flexibly across multiple areas, often as members of work teams. Results were analyzed to determine the extent to which the colleges respond to the changing needs of employers, as well as the level of quality and cost-effectiveness with which they do so. Enrollment in Industrial Production Technology programs decreased by 10% over the five-year review period. Recommendations are presented for consideration, including: (1) programs should be reviewed to ensure they are addressing the skills needed by employers; (2) colleges should pursue enhanced partnerships with high schools, vocational schools, and business and industry; (3) colleges should monitor completions; and (4) colleges should ensure that applicable machining standards are addressed in the curriculum.

Head Start teachers were nonrandomly assigned to a control group, a Long Intervention group, or a Brief Intervention group. The Long Intervention group received a 6-hour training session conducted over one day. The Brief Intervention group received two 3-hour training sessions held 2 months apart. Training in the two intervention groups was identical and included training in the following areas: effects of violence over the lifespan, teaching young children to resolve conflict peacefully, handling  teacher-parent conflicts, using positive discipline, and commitment to change. Data were collected on teachers' knowledge regarding violence prevention and attitudes related to violence prevention competency, violence prevention attributes, role efficacy, and remediation competency. Eighty-four teachers completed both pre- and posttests. The results indicated that knowledge and attitudes were influenced by the training and by having had prior exposure to violence. Posttest scores in remediation competence and violence prevention attributes improved over pretest scores, with the increase greater for those in the Brief Intervention group than in other groups. Knowledge score increases were greatest for those in the Long Intervention group and for those who had previous experience with  violence. Higher final knowledge scores were associated with higher final remediation competence scores. (Author/KB)",

Assessment of 67 four-year-olds was done through systematic observations of social behavior, including social participation, type of play, and affective involvement in the preschool setting, as well as specific evaluation of the multiple aspects of their social thought, including perspective taking, prosocial comprehension, social representation, and self-esteem. Analyses revealed four modes of social thought: (1) cohesion-centered; (2) insecure-self-centered; (3) conflict-centered; and (4) socially-centered. In line with a sociogenetic perspective of social information processing, both social and nonsocial activities in the  preschool setting, as well as transactional emotional state, were implicated with individual differences in modes of social thought. Children who were conflict-centered were more involved in constructive play with objects, whereas socio-centered children were more affectively neutral and reflexive. Transactions with adults were positively correlated with agonistic processing and negatively correlated with ambiguous processing. (Contains 10 references.) (Author/KB)",

Twenty of the students also responded to a structured interview about their stressors and coping strategies. The mean age was 12.60 years with 56 percent of the sample being males. Forty-eight percent attended a Reform, 31 percent a Conservative, and 21 percent an Orthodox synagogue. Over 50 percent of the sample reported having experienced a variety of religious stressors in the past year, such as being restricted from activities due to the Sabbath or experiencing anti-Semitic comments. In responding to the Brief Religious Coping Strategies  Scale for Jewish Children, developed for this study, students endorsed a variety of religious coping strategies from each of three factors: (1) seeking God's direction/support; (2) seeking cultural/social support; and (3) spiritual struggle. Religious stressors and coping strategies were positively related to several measures of Jewish identity. (Author/KB)",

Subjects completed two questionnaires measuring prenatal activities and attitudes toward pregnancy and motherhood during their twenty-first to thirty-eighth week of pregnancy. Three to six weeks following the birth of their babies, the new mothers completed two questionnaires which assessed their affective reactions to their babies and the satisfaction they received from engaging in activities with their babies. Analysis of findings indicated that engaging in preparatory  activities, such as nursery planning and obtaining items for the baby, facilitated a positive attitude toward pregnancy and further, that these activities were important predictors of women's positive adjustment to early parenting. Postnatal adjustment to motherhood was not significantly predicted by prenatal family support or marital status, but was predicted by overall prenatal adjustment, future parenting adjustment, how mothers felt their babies would respond to them after birth, and mothers' attitudes during pregnancy toward parenting.

        "description":"Unintentional injuries are the number one cause of death in childhood, and boys experience two to four times more injuries than girls. The present study examined whether mothers differed in their speed to intervene and the nature of their intervention responses depending on the sex of the child, the injury history of the child, the level of risk taking mothers expected of the child, and the risk-taking activity in which the child was engaged. Videotapes of 8-year-old children (either boys or girls) engaging in injury-risk play activities on a playground were shown to mothers who were asked to intervene by stopping the tape and saying what they would do if they and their child were in the situation shown. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed that when viewing female  children, mothers were more likely to judge behaviors as posing some degree of injury-risk, and they intervened more frequently and quickly than when viewing male children engaged in exactly the same behaviors. The speed of mothers' intervention positively correlated both with their children's injury history and frequency of risk taking, indicating that mothers of children who were previously injured and often engaged in injury-risk behaviors had a higher degree of tolerance for children's risk taking than mothers of children who experienced fewer injuries and engaged less frequently in injury-risk behaviors. Examining the nature of mothers' verbalizations in response to children's risk taking revealed that girls received more cautions and statements encouraging them to analyze the  situation and to think in terms of how their behavior could lead to injury outcomes, whereas boys received more statements encouraging risk-taking behavior.

Participating in the study were 49 children, ages 40 to 75 months from a predominately white, middle to upper class sample. Self-report questionnaires concerning the expression of emotion, management of marital conflict, and marital satisfaction were obtained from the mothers of children who had been given an assessment of their ability to label negative emotions and talk about hidden negative emotions. Children's facial expressions to the presentation of an emotionally evocative puppet vignette were also assessed. The results indicated that individual differences in children's understanding of negative emotions were related to  specific dimensions of family experiences. The data provide support for the notion that specific family experiences are related to key aspects of early emotion understanding. (Contains 12 references.) (Author/KB)",

Participating were 104 university students ranging in age from 18 to 26 years. Subjects completed the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) Scale, modified to include relationships in addition to romantic partners, and the Adult Attachment Scale (AAS). The findings suggested that students exhibited the same attachment styles in their most intimate relationship as they exhibited to people in general. On the ECR Scale, the preoccupied attachment style was not discriminated from the secure style. In comparison with the AAS, the preoccupied style on the ECR was not discriminated from the secure style on the AAS. Students showing the preoccupied attachment style on the  ECR were securely attached as measured by the AAS. The incapability of discrimination between the preoccupied and the secure attachment style was partly due to the attachment style prototype based on behavioral patterns in American samples. (KB)",

        "description":"The formation of attachments is an important phenomenon occurring in the realm of socioemotional development. This study examined the impact of infant massage on infants' subsequent attachment security. Fifty-seven mother-infant dyads (48 dyads from Head Start, 9 from the community at large) were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group when infants were less than 8 months of age. The treatment group received training in infant massage and education about infant development during four 1-hour sessions. The control group received education only about infant development during four 1-hour sessions. Mothers completed questionnaires prior to the intervention and when their infants were 12 months old. Attachment security was assessed using the Attachment Q-set at the 12-month  follow-up. There were no pretest or demographic differences between the two groups. Twelve subjects were lost at the 12-month follow-up, with equal loss occurring in both groups. The results indicated that mothers who massaged their 12-month-old infants more than once per week had infants who were statistically significantly more securely attached than infants of mothers who massaged their infants less than once per week, and were more securely attached than infants in the control group. Surprisingly, seven mothers in the control group reported that they massaged their infants at least twice weekly. Attachment security was also related to infant's gender, number of siblings, and maternal age. Regression analyses revealed that maternal age accounted for 20 percent of the variance in  attachment security, and massage frequency accounted for 18 percent of the variance. (Author/KB)",

Participating were a low-risk sample of 74 middle-class mother/first-born infant dyads who had participated as volunteers in a combined parent-support program and research project over seven years. Infants ranged in age from 3 weeks to 9 months at time of entry, with mothers' age ranging from 26 to 43 years. Within the context of the ongoing program, the following assessments were conducted: (1) interaffectivity, through ratings of mother-infant videotaped play; (2) quality of attachment; (3) perinatal vulnerability, through structured clinical interviews with  mothers; and (4) infant temperament. Findings indicated that interaffectivity and attachment were significantly correlated for the entire sample and the PV group. Although postnatal maternal illness and prenatal vulnerabilities tended to lower attachment for the group as a whole, those dyads showing higher levels of interaffectivity had higher levels of attachment. Maternal depression symptoms following birth were reported by 27 percent of the subjects; self-report of such symptoms during the first 6 months was correlated to observations at 14 months through the depression variables of the interaffectivity scale. Self-reported depression was negatively related to interaffectivity and attachment, and was related positively to previous pregnancy loss, fertility problems, and C-section  delivery. Mothers reporting perinatal depression saw their infants as unusually fussy, difficult, demanding, unadaptable, persistent, and unsociable at 14 months. (Six tables detail findings.) (KB)",

Subjects were 192 intact, primarily dual-earner families consisting of mothers, fathers, and two adolescent siblings (firstborn children were in 8th, 9th, or 10th grade and had siblings 1 to 4 years younger). The families completed home and telephone interviews regarding adolescent and family functioning. Results of hierarchical regression analyses of their responses suggested that divergent parent-adolescent perceptions of parental acceptance did not predict adolescent adjustment over  and above the level of acceptance. The findings suggested that previous research needs to be examined more critically, for they seriously question the interpretability of divergent perceptions when level of acceptance is ignored.

Subjects were 382 preservice teachers enrolled in either an early childhood or elementary teacher preparation program. Statistical analysis of responses to a version of the Gibson and Dembo Teacher Efficacy Scale revealed significant interactions between the two teacher preparation programs, the point where preservice teachers were in their programs (beginning or ending), and their academic major. Several factors differed across programs, including teachers' sense of their ability to work with children from diverse backgrounds and to use behavior management and discipline conceptions, and beliefs regarding their contribution to children's outcomes.  Qualitative analyses revealed differences in preservice teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning between different programs and majors. The study identified similar patterns of preservice teachers' sense of efficacy and beliefs across teacher education programs. Preservice teachers' perceived efficacy appears to be associated with some emerging beliefs such as the concept of strong teacher responsibility for children's learning, their perception of their role as teachers, and some teacher characteristics of being stable, productive, positive, and responsible.

The paper first describes the primary contributors to emotional competence, including the self or ego identity, moral sense, and developmental history. The paper then details eight skills that constitute emotional competence: (1) awareness of one's emotional state; (2) ability to discern others' emotions; (3) ability to describe emotions; (4) capacity to empathize with other's emotional experiences; (5) ability to realize the difference between inner emotional states and outward  expression; (6) capacity for adaptive coping with aversive emotions; (7) awareness of the role of emotions in the structure of relationships; and (8) the capacity for emotional self-efficacy. Next, the paper distinguishes between theories of emotional competence and emotional intelligence. The paper concludes by discussing one of the consequences of emotional competence, the effective skill in managing one's emotions, which is considered critical to negotiating interpersonal exchanges.

This paper reviews literature on male early childhood teachers and explores the reasons given by four men for deciding to be Montessori early childhood teachers. The paper then considers reasons for the disproportionately low numbers of males in the profession, lack of support for and stereotypes related to males who work with young children, and reasons for entering the field. The paper details interviews conducted with the four male Montessori teachers regarding their reasons for becoming a Montessori teacher, for teaching in early childhood education, and the types of biases they encountered. Reasons cited for entering the teaching  profession included dissatisfaction with current jobs, childhood aspirations, and following in a parent's footsteps. The choice of early childhood education was influenced by internship placements in early childhood programs, positive early teaching experiences with young children, and parenthood preparation. The choice of a Montessori school was influenced by attendance in a Montessori school throughout childhood, compatibility with the Montessori philosophy, and a positive impression of other Montessori teachers. Several stereotypes or other concerns were noted, including experiencing sexual harassment, being wary of accusations of child molestation, being the butt of stereotypical jokes, and dealing with double standards. Parents were reported as happy that their child had a male  teacher but suspicious if their child talked a lot about the teacher at home. (Contains 20 references.) (KB)",

This study assessed children's ability to self-report on the emotional attention, emotional clarity, and emotional repair dimensions of emotional intelligence, using a modification of the above scale, the Trait Meta-Mood Scale for Children (TMMS-C). A total of 691 elementary school children from grades 3 to 7 completed a 28-item scale combining adapted items from the TMMS and a measure of dispositional optimism. Subjects also completed scales measuring depressive symptoms, social anxiety and social avoidance, and life satisfaction, as well as a friendship assessment. Internal validity of the TMMS-C was tested by assessing the  reliability of subscales. Convergent external validity was assessed by examining the relation between children's self-reports on the TMMS-C and their self-reports on other measures of emotion regulation. Divergent external validity was assessed by examining the relation between self-perceived emotional competence (TMMS-C) and measures of perceived and objective social competence. In addition, the relation between TMMS-C subscales and children's adjustment was assessed, using a measure of life satisfaction. Results indicated that the measure had adequate internal reliability (subscale Cronbach's alphas .58 to .76) and that children's reports about their emotional competence were linked in important ways to their social competence and adjustment.

        "description":"Although efforts to support family-school partnerships are a prominent part of strategies for improving education for at-risk students, in communities with wide home/school cultural differences, such &quot;partnerships&quot; often operate on a superficial level involving one-way compliance to school norms. This study examined home-school partnerships in a New York City school, focusing on two families whose children attended the same fifth grade classroom in 1996-97. Members of the Ruiz Vega family and the Arjay family were interviewed and visited at home several times. Clarissa Ruiz had severe reading problems that were overlooked at school because she did not call attention to herself. The study maintains that her parents were not the aggressive advocates that school personnel believed  necessary because of their own poor school experiences, lack of skills, and the intimidation of parents inherent in school practices. Luther Arjay had considerable difficulty in completing homework. His mother and school personnel identified the reason for the difficulty and implemented a solution. Mrs. Arjay had a great deal of support from a parent-teacher program sponsored by Lehman College in Luther's fifth grade and was determined to enroll him in the best middle school she could find. The study concluded that the attitudinal changes required to foster the mutual respect necessary to form effective partnerships must be deep and widespread, and must involve transforming the whole school culture. At this school, other reform efforts openly contradicted the effort to foster  school-family partnerships. Thus, some families found the door to partnership open, and others found it closed.

        "description":"Despite abundant research relating physical attractiveness and social skill, no studies have systematically assessed the influence of social behavior on perceived attractiveness. This study experimentally investigated how exposure to positive, negative, and neutral childhood behaviors influences ratings of physical attractiveness and other social judgments known to co-exist within the attractiveness stereotype. The study further examined whether social behavior might moderate the effects of attractive or unattractive appearance over time. Participating were 111 Caucasian and 64 Non-Caucasian fourth- and fifth-grade girls, randomly assigned to rate the attractiveness, intelligence, popularity, and likability of either a facially attractive or an unattractive stimulus girl shown in  a video still photograph. Participants were then randomly assigned to view the same stimulus girl in a series of 10 videotaped vignettes in which she interacted with a peer in either a positive, negative, or neutral manner. After viewing the videos, subjects completed the rating a second time. The results indicated that attractiveness was highly correlated with judgments of intelligence, popularity, and likability based on photographs prior to exposure to behavior, with correlations ranging from .59 to .77. Further, behavior was a strongly moderating factor in peer judgments. Positive behavior increased and negative behavior decreased ratings of attractiveness and other social judgments regardless of the attractiveness level of the stimulus girl. Neutral behavior frequently had a positive  effect on attractiveness ratings and social judgments for the unattractive stimulus girl. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/KB)",

        "description":"This study examined differences in adolescents' levels of autonomy as a function of parenting and parental involvement practices and the adolescents' year-end grade point averages. Participating were 872 adolescents, with a mean age of 14.45 years, attending 5 French-speaking public high schools in Quebec, Canada. Measures were subjects' general year-end grade point averages, the Student Report of Autonomy, the Student Report of Parenting Style, and the Student Report of Parent Involvement. The findings indicated that adolescents' autonomy and more specifically, work orientation followed by self-reliance and identity, individually contributed to the prediction of school grades. The three parenting style dimensions (warmth, supervision, and psychological autonomy granting) and one  parental involvement dimension (affective support) showed a positive relationship with work orientation. Parent-adolescent interactions on daily school matters were negatively related to autonomy and work orientation. Parental warmth had a direct relation, through autonomy and two of its dimensions, on school grades, work orientation, and self-reliance, whereas psychological autonomy granting and affective support had both a direct and an indirect effect. Supervision was found to partially mediate the link between work orientation and school grades. Findings lend support to the importance of considering autonomy and at least two of its dimensions, work orientation and self-reliance, in the study of parenting and parental involvement practices in relation to school grades.

        "description":"This observational study investigated children's temperaments and their relation to behavior and emotion across different contexts. Temperament, or individual behavioral style, was conceptualized as the manifestation of affect displays and social behaviors in context, with emotions acting as signals for interactions. Ratings of child temperament were obtained from parents and teachers of 205 children. Sixty-four hours of observation in preschool and junior primary classrooms were undertaken with a selected sample of 32 children. The findings revealed low to moderate correlations between teacher and parent ratings of child temperament and of expectations for children, indicating the differing perspectives of teachers and parents on child temperament and providing support for the  view of child temperament as context-specific. There were strong temperament-behavior relationships found in classroom observations, in respect of affect, and in respect of interactions between temperament and affect. Difficult temperament children were consistently involved in more negative interactions for emotional and social behaviors with teachers and peers than the easy temperament children. Easy children displayed and were responded to with more positive responses in emotional and social behaviors. The function of emotions as signals in classroom interactions, reflecting the relational view of emotions as developing in the context of interactions, was confirmed. (Contains 36 references.) (KB)",

This paper describes the program and summarizes findings from the longitudinal evaluation. Home visitors provided advocacy, information, and support for mothers and their infants from before the child's birth until the child was 5 years old. Infants were provided child care from the age of 6 months onward. Findings from the 10-year follow-up indicated that, compared with contrast youth, more of the FDRP youths expressed a liking for their own physical and personal attributes; and they were also more likely to see themselves in a schooling situation 5  years in the future. Contrast youth were more likely than FDRP youth to say that the worst thing about school was trouble that one could get into. The strongest findings of the 10-year follow-up were for juvenile delinquency. Only 6 percent of FDRP youth, compared to 22 percent of contrast youth, were processed as probation cases by the County Probation Department; contrast youth also had more serious offenses. Juvenile court costs per child were less for FDRP youth than for contrast youth. Although there were no educational differences between FDRP males and contrast males, FDRP females had better grades and fewer school absences than did contrast females. Due to difficulties in locating the adults from the contrast group, data are not available to contrast current adult functioning.  (KB)",

        "description":"This interpretive research explores five first graders' perceptions of reading and of being readers, asking the questions: What does reading or being a reader mean to a group of children who are at the end of first grade? What do they see as its purpose? and How do they view themselves as readers? The data are presented in the form of narratives describing the children and their views, followed by a discussion of the children's reading identities and purposes for reading as condensed into five categories: practice, people, power, pleasure, and performance. Practice, a main purpose for the children, entailed reading longer words and books, learning more words, and developing decoding skills. Reading as a social process included connections to people, both while being taught to  read and when sharing texts with others. Mastery of reading provided varied feelings of power and control either over general textual ideas or over the words themselves. Pleasure and humor were emphasized in relation to children's reading, while instrumental motives were attributed to adults and to teacher-directed activities. Performance allowed for a display of knowledge and skills, but brought fear of ridicule for some. (Five appendices include interview questions and children's narratives.

To achieve this, local county partnerships have focused both their attention and their funds on implementing child care programs, family programs, and health services. Evaluation strategies included measuring changes in child care quality, family functioning, and children's receipt of health services, and the long-term outcome of school success. This report highlights four main program goals: (1) children are healthy and prepared to succeed in school; (2) families effectively fulfill their role as primary providers, nurturers, and teachers; (3) high quality,  affordable services for children and families will be available; and (4) North Carolina counties value children and families by providing options and resources, and encouraging collaboration. The report presents the main data collection strategies being used to evaluate progress for each goal, followed by brief summaries of recent results. The most significant findings to date are that child care quality improved as a result of Smart Start and that children from low-income families who attended a Smart Start-involved child care program were significantly more prepared for school than were similar children who attended other centers, or no centers at all. Speech problems were the most likely developmental problem to receive preschool treatment. Playground improvement grants did result in  improved playground safety. Also noted was increased collaboration among individuals and agencies involved with young children and families. An appendix contains a list of reports from the Smart Start evaluation team. (KB)",

Participating were 140 European- and African-American married, working-class mothers and their sixth-grade children in North Carolina. Data were obtained through questionnaires completed separately by mothers and adolescents, videotapes of dyads during an interaction task in a laboratory setting at the beginning of the school year, and questionnaires regarding peer aggression  completed by teachers at the end of the school year. Findings indicated that boys were more overtly aggressive than girls, and girls were more relationally aggressive than boys. Patterns of correlations between parenting variables and relational aggression were highly similar for boys and girls. Associations between parenting and overt aggression were different for boys and girls, and associations were much stronger for boys than girls. There were four models for which mothers' interaction styles and disciplinary strategies were significantly associated with boys' aggression, but no such models were identified for girls' aggression. Multiple regression analyses suggested that only mothers' interaction styles accounted for a significant portion of variance in boys' overt aggression. There  was no evidence that mothers' disciplinary strategies mediated this association; however, mothers' negative interaction styles moderated the effect of child reports of harsh discipline on boys' overt aggression.

The statistical portrait is based on five indicators: (1) fourth graders' performance on the Ohio fourth grade reading proficiency test; (2) number of children receiving child care assistance or participating in Head Start programs; (3) children's health status; (4) participation in programs that alleviate poverty and promote self-sufficiency; and (5) family movement from welfare to work. Findings indicated that 68 percent of the fourth graders taking the reading proficiency test in 1998 passed; under new 1999 proficiency standards, only 47 percent would have passed. More than $277 million was available in fiscal year 1999 for child care  assistance, with a monthly participation of 62,618 children. Head Start participation was 57,159 children in 1998. About 40 percent of Ohio infants born in 1997 had at least one risk factor. In 1997 almost 8 percent of infants were born at low birthweight. The number of children enrolled in Medicaid in December, 1998 was 560,731 and was expected to increase by approximately 104,000. Over 670,000 Ohio families received the federal Earned Income Credit in 1997. Thirty-four percent of families owed child support received at least one cash payment in 1997, up from 21 percent in 1990. Ohio public assistance caseloads dropped by 46 percent from September 1995 to September 1998. However, more than 26,077 Ohio adults may use up their time limit by October, 2000.

        "description":"This study examined how parental practices in mainland China influence adolescents' school performance, including school motivation and grade point average (GPA), when moderated by self-esteem and self-efficacy. Participating in the study were 497 students, ranging in age from 12 to 19 years, attending six public junior and senior high schools. Subjects completed a questionnaire designed to assess adolescents' perception of parental support, reasoning, monitoring, punitiveness, and autonomy granting, as well as subjects' school motivation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and conformity to parents. The findings indicated that all five parental practices were significant predictors of at least one of the moderating variables: conformity to parents, self-esteem, and self-efficacy.  Parental support and monitoring were positive predictors of conformity, whereas parental reasoning and autonomy-granting were positive predictors of self-efficacy. Parental punitiveness and autonomy-granting predicted self-esteem. Both conformity to parents and self-efficacy had positive effects on school motivation, with self-efficacy also having a strong positive and direct influence on GPA. Self-esteem did not affect either motivation or GPA significantly. (Contains 32 references.) (KB)",

        "description":"The principal aims of the Tipton Childminding Project, begun in 1994, were to increase access to and quality of training and support for childminders and caregivers in England's Tipton Challenge area, to increase the number of childminders and child caregivers from all sections of the community, to promote interagency initiatives to develop links between childminding and other forms of childcare provision, and to demonstrate the value of different forms of childminding support in raising the quality of childminding. This report documents the work of that project from 1994 to 1998, detailing the project's development and chronological history. Among the conclusions of the report are that: (1) there is a need for continued support, advice, and guidance for partnership agencies to  enable sustainable collaboration; (2) training for childminders was found to be very effective and was delivered monthly by the Social Services Department and the Tipton Childminding Project by 1995; and (3) the Project had become one of the largest providers of independent daycare training and post-registration childminding training. Recommendations are delineated with regard to childminder requirements, the need for childminder support, the need for increased public awareness, and the need for specific and regular training for childminders. Included in the report are case studies and reports presenting a social services department perspective, describing the involvement of the Youth Forum and the Save the Children, and detailing the project's achievements. Also included are samples of  leaflets used in the project. Two appendices include a questionnaire used to identify childminders' needs. (KB)",

This report details a study of the implementation of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in the United Kingdom (UK) and contrasts the U.K. approach with those adopted in other states, focusing on those at comparable stages of economic, social, and political development. Methods used in the study included a literature review of appropriate documents, such as summaries of U.N. Committee hearings and state party reports; questionnaires completed by staff of nongovernmental agencies and government officials; and follow-up telephone interviews. The report outlines arguments for the promotion of children's rights, explains the significance of the U.N.  Convention, and identifies how the Convention can be used as a tool for implementing children's rights. The bulk of the report compares the approaches to reporting adopted in other countries and the measures put in place to support implementation of the Convention. The report examines recent developments in the U.K., draws out conclusions, and provides recommendations as to how positive approaches to reporting and implementation can be most effectively pursued within the U.K. References are listed throughout the report.

        "description":"In an effort to stimulate discussion and provide a tool for policymakers and practitioners in developing effective child-centered programs that protect children from hazardous and exploitative labor, this paper examines ways in which work can contribute to, as well as harm, children's development; it also aims to provide a conceptual framework for assessing whether work is helpful or harmful to children. The paper explains how involving working children themselves in policy and action to address their problems results in more effective action and contributes to children's development. Noting that treating working children as intelligent and resourceful, and developing solutions in conjunction with them, may strengthen their psychological development and ability to cope with  difficulties, the paper maintains that child-centered action on child labor requires concerted action by governments to address poverty, provide quality education, and implement laws protecting children from abuse. Such action also requires public awareness-raising and changing attitudes so that employers and parents match children's responsibilities with their capacities; so that policymakers, practitioners, and consumers differentiate between developmental and harmful work; and so that working children's views are solicited and used. The paper concludes with a range of practical ways to ensure that any work that children do is safe and healthy for them and promotes their development. These include specific measures that employers can take, an enhanced role for trade unions in ensuring  that children of legal working age are protected in the workplace, and suggestions for educational changes to increase its effectiveness for and relevance for working children.

        "description":"The present study was a cross-sectional examination of the causes of adolescent participation in risky behaviors, using a diverse sample of adolescents from a Midwestern state. This research compared the relative effects of a traditional explanation of deviant behavior, differential association theory, with a modern derivative, nonsocial reinforcement theory. Quantitative data were collected via questionnaires in the spring of 1998 from 86 students at a public high school, 12 students from a for-profit high school, and 16 students from a detention facility for status offenders. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent of their involvement with cigarettes, alcohol, and various drugs. The multiple linear regression results indicated that while both differential association and  nonsocial reinforcement had statistically significant effects on involvement with drugs and alcohol in this sample, nonsocial reinforcement theory had a stronger explanatory effect than differential association. Further, contrary to official statistics, neither gender, race, or social class had a statistically significant effect upon engagement in the risk-taking behaviors in this study.

The statistical portrait is based on indicators of well-being including: (1) children's insurance coverage; (2) health care access; (3) health outcomes, including immunization rates and early prenatal care; (4) juvenile arrests; (5) teen pregnancy rates; (6) suicide attempts; (7) high school dropout rate; (8) eighth grade reading and mathematics proficiency; (9) child abuse and neglect rate; (10) low birth weight infants; and (11) child care supply. The bulk of the document is comprised of key statewide and county findings on child health care, and general county indicators of well-being. The report also describes state programs designed to expand child  health care. Findings indicate that although Oregon has reduced the percentage of children without health insurance since 1990, nearly 10 percent were uninsured in 1998, an increase from 1996. Nearly 25 percent of uninsured children were eligible for insurance through a parent's employer, but parents could not afford the employee's share of the health plan. The availability of health care providers varies greatly across the state, with many families facing additional barriers to health care access, such as lack of transportation. In 1997, 73 percent of 2-year-olds were current for basic immunizations. About 80 percent of infants were born to mothers who had received early prenatal care. In the 1990s, the leading causes of child death were motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cancer, and  homicide. Data notes and sources complete the report. (KB)",

The statistical portrait is based on a variety of indicators in five areas: (1) child health care access; (2) physical and mental health; (3) community and family environment; (4) social and economic opportunity; and (5) education and learning. Following the data for these areas, the report presents state level trend data, a Maine state profile, county-by-county profiles, 1990 census data, and definitions and sources of data. The report notes that while a brighter economy and tightened eligibility requirements have decreased welfare roles, families getting off welfare may simply be swelling the ranks of the working poor, as evidenced in the  increase in numbers of children receiving subsidized school lunches and the decline in jobs paying a livable wage. In addition, the state has seen an increase in child abuse cases, children placed in the care of the state, and in substance abuse. Infant mortality and teen pregnancies are declining. With regard to access to child health care, the report shows that the state still has at least 1 in 10 children without health insurance coverage, that these children are more at risk of poor health consequences than are low-income but privately-insured children, and that free and low cost health insurance for children is available through the State Children's Health Insurance Program.

        "description":"Child care has become a central issue to most Californians and is increasingly important to policymakers. The Little Hoover Commission examined child care in California, focusing on the long-standing competition between the quantity of services available and the quality of services provided. Information was obtained from an advisory committee of over 100 child care experts, from witnesses at two public hearings, numerous studies on child care issues, material gathered from think tanks, and interviews of child care experts. Four major conclusions and recommendations were drawn from the data. First, California lacks and needs an effective strategy to supply the high-quality child care that working families need. The state should adopt a child care master plan to guide its efforts  to help families and communities meet child care needs. Second, shortages of licensed child care extend statewide and are especially severe in low-income, rural, and minority communities. The state should set a goal of expanding child care capacity so all Californians have access to services. Third, the subsidized child care system serves a fraction of eligible families and services are not well-matched to community needs. There should be sufficient funding for subsidized child care and the system should be fundamentally reformed. Fourth, state policies and other factors subvert the goal of assuring all children high-quality care and early education opportunities. The state should undertake a broad-based effort to improve the quality of child care and expand early education opportunities.

Following an executive summary, the report details the reasons for developing compensation guidelines, outlines the history of compensation initiatives in California, and delineates guiding principles for the development of the guidelines. The report also presents the Child Development Permit Matrix, a career ladder for teachers and administrators in Title 5 programs, articulating the minimal and  alternative educational and training requirements for the array of positions within a child care center, and providing the foundation for the salary guidelines. The Self-Sufficiency Standard details self-sufficiency wages for a range of family sizes and compositions for each county in California. The report then explains the structure of the compensation guidelines, details challenges and resources for implementing the guidelines, describes initiatives for gaining statewide support for the guidelines, and discusses ways to adapt the guidelines for individual communities. The report's six appendices include information on creating and revising salary schedules, model benefits for teaching staff in center-based child care, and a worksheet for assessing program salaries and goals.

        "description":"This report details a field study to evaluate the efforts of Pakistan's Primary Education Development Program (PED) to improve the access, equity, and quality of primary education in Pakistan, especially for rural girls. A 3-week visit was conducted in 1997 by a team from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Center for Development Information and Evaluation. Following a presentation of background on the project initiation, the report discusses strategies used to build and strengthen the primary educational system by strengthening public primary schools and building private education institutions; examines the strategies used to increase access to primary education such as opening more schools for girls and increasing the number of female teachers in  rural areas; and discusses the issue of improving the quality of girls' education and of teacher education. Findings noted in the report indicate that the program resulted in more than 2,100 new girls' schools in the Balochistan and North-West Frontier Province, a 70 percent increase from 1989 through 1994. There was a substantial increase in girls' access to primary schools, with 348,000 girls enrolled in grades 1-5 in 1989 and 761,300 in 1996. Strategies identified as especially effective in achieving such rapid gains were: (1) communicating one clear goal--enrolling girls in primary school-- through policy changes and program activities; (2) opening more schools for girls; and (3) recruiting and training more female teachers for rural schools. The report concludes with a discussion of  the USAID's leadership role and a presentation of lessons learned from this evaluation. (KB)",

This report examines the state of child care in Colorado. Part 1 presents information on 1998-1999 state appropriations for child care and other programs, discusses the importance of early intervention, delineates the benefits of high quality child care for children and parents, and profiles the state and selected counties with regard to child care supply, quality, affordability, and availability. This part also describes selected programs, included resource and referral services. Part 2 delineates the characteristics of quality child  care, discusses tools for promoting quality, and describes model programs. Part 3 considers the affordability of child care, focusing on funding of services, the role of infrastructure, and the educare model. Part 4 discusses the accessibility of child care, describes the barriers to securing good care, and outlines how child care resource and referral provides and coordinates services and programs for children and families.

This report presents observations of a kindergarten class in Minsk, Belarus conducted through the auspices of Friendship Force, an international organization striving to promote peace through understanding. The report describes the facilities housing Kindergarten No. 490, including the building, classrooms, sleeping areas, bathrooms, and additional rooms. Also described are the children attending the program, the program staff, and the daily schedule and curriculum. Teaching methods are highlighted, with a focus on the  kindergarten's unique approach to health education involving water treatments. The report further provides information on services for children with special needs, and on teacher training and compensation. The report concludes with a discussion of changes in the educational system since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and a comparison of programs for young children in Belarus and the United States.

        "description":"Noting that variety in education may be seen as a basic mechanism for change, this paper examines four important developments in public education: (1) site-based decision making; (2) charter schools; (3) whole school designs; and (4) parent choice. The paper maintains that site-based decision making should involve giving schools authority and responsibility for solving their own problems and then leading them to improve rather than just leaving schools alone to solve their problems. The paper further notes that although the growth of charter schools illustrates the potential for future entrepreneurs' efforts in education, there probably will not be any entirely new models of education invented. The paper advocates whole school programming, or comprehensive school reform, and  describes examples of successful implementation of externally-developed and designed school programs. Also noted is the importance of careful evaluation to determine if such programs produce results, and concern that the leadership and support needed to successfully implement educational models may be underestimated. Finally, the paper suggests that some degree of choice is an essential part of the emerging model of schooling and that parent choice is necessary with greater variety of educational models. The paper also maintains that education can be successful only when parents and teachers share a common philosophy, and advocates the development of a model moderating individual choice by limiting available choices to those approved by a responsible public agency. A recommendation for  working toward deliberate educational variety concludes the paper. (KB)",

Two major dimensions of development--normative and dynamic--are explored, and four categories of learning goals are discussed: (1) knowledge; (2) skills; (3) dispositions; and (4) feelings. The view that children learn most effectively when they are engaged in interaction rather than in receptive or passive activities is presented. The digest also discusses the risks of early academic instruction and the need for a variety of teaching methods and informal learning environments. An intellectually oriented approach in which children work together in small groups to explore their environment is recommended. (LPP)",

This book provides an in-depth history of the Free School, including a brief analysis of its place in the broader scheme of things; describes the school with reference to the various alternatives to conventional schooling; and addresses certain fundamental subjects often neglected in our national thinking about children. Various anecdotes describe ways of working with children as unique individuals, based on faith in every child's inborn desire to learn. The anecdotes are organized into chapters that demonstrate school philosophy about handling disruptive or aggressive children, the apprenticeship  model of learning, children's emotional and interpersonal issues, fear, concentration, television's effect on children, religion and spirituality, race and class, sexuality, teaching, and community. The concept of community is central to the school's philosophy. Children profit immensely from exposure to the practice of community at the Free School, because it establishes an interior template that helps them find personal meaning based on their ability to connect with others.

The first section discusses Mexican immigration to Illinois during the 1900s and provides racial/ethnic data on population growth in the Midwest and Illinois during the 1980s; educational attainment, 1980-95; income and poverty rates; and population change in metro and nonmetro Illinois, 1990-96. In &quot;Anytown,&quot; a rapid influx of Hispanic workers for a new meatpacking plant has resulted in local conflicts over education, housing, and race. Hispanic students in the schools increased from less than 5 in 1993 to 350 in 1998. As school administrators became aware of  the rising numbers, they responded by hiring translators, bilingual aides, and a bilingual coordinator; creating a prekindergarten class for Hispanic students; encouraging parent participation; and developing appropriate curricula and assessment methods. Teachers participated in workshops and conferences about cultural change and the classroom. As staff and administrators gained knowledge and understanding about the needs of language-minority students, they shifted toward a more student-centered philosophy and began developing bilingual and multicultural programs. Interviews with immigrants about experiences in the community, at work, and in school portray the racism encountered by culturally diverse newcomers, but also the efforts of teachers and community members to improve community  relations and social integration.

Looking specifically at the Chicano/Latino scholar, it is argued that the racial/ethnic factor seems to interact with another pervasive source of division among scholars: the tension between doing research for research's sake and the more applied aspect of academics. This brings into play larger questions about political commitment, partisanship, and advocacy, as well as the relative merits of researcher objectivity and &quot;scientific detachment&quot; versus the empathic understanding of the participant observer. Data from the  Carnegie National Faculty Survey (1984) and the National Latino Faculty Survey (1987) are used to compare the views of Latino and non-Hispanic faculty on scholarship and university life and to present the perceptions of Chicano and Puerto Rican faculty on how Latino group-based research is rated in academe.

Following sociodemographic and HIV risk profiles for Mexican farmworkers, the major HIV exposure categories for farmworkers are discussed: prostitution, sex between men, needle sharing, and wives and female partners of men who engage in these behaviors. Farmworker knowledge and misconceptions about HIV transmission and condom use are examined. The results of large surveys concerning condom use are reported. Three behaviors--using condoms with occasional sex partners, using condoms with regular sex partners, and carrying condoms--were all predicted by social norms and perceived AIDS vulnerability. However, the  addition of &quot;condom efficacy&quot; (the ability to negotiate condom use in challenging situations) as a predictor variable greatly reduced the effects of social norms. Aspects of culturally competent HIV research and implications for future HIV research with Mexican farmworkers are discussed. Implications for HIV prevention services for Mexican farmworkers are suggested, including general recommendations and suggestions for male-focused and female-focused interventions.

The sample included 48 K-8 and 48 K-12 districts with K-8 enrollments ranging from 70 to 370 students. Findings indicate that it is more difficult to financially support small rural high schools than small rural elementary schools. Rural districts had limited capability to raise local revenue because of their low assessed valuation per pupil, which was associated with low assessment rates of agricultural real estate compared to residential and commercial property. District expenditures per pupil were below the state average and declined as enrollment increased. The student-teacher ratio was  lower in K-12 districts than in K-8 districts; these lower ratios were associated with higher expenditures per pupil, higher operating levies, and lower teacher salaries. All teachers were underpaid relative to the state mean, but teachers in small K-12 districts were paid less than teachers in small K-8 districts. This implies that the conversion of small K-12 districts to K-8 districts may be an effective strategy to improve rural teacher salaries. Compared to state averages, small rural schools had better educational outcomes, suggesting that underfunding and low teacher salaries did not influence educational outcomes.

        "description":"Traditional educational practices of Indigenous Canadians were aimed at cultural transmission. All adults were responsible for educating the young, but because children stayed with the women until puberty, women played the most significant role in transmitting the culture. Adults with certain gifts and talents looked for similar attributes in children and then had the responsibility to nurture those gifts and talents to fruition through mentoring. Data from the 1991 Canadian census show that Indigenous women tend to work in service-providing areas, echoing their traditional nurturing roles, with approximately four times as many women as men working in education-related jobs. A 3-year study of eight Ojibwe women enrolled in a teacher education program revealed a strong sense of  cultural continuity. Their most frequently mentioned goals as educators involved a sense of community responsibility expressed as concern for the children, future generations, and well-being of the people. The immediate challenge for Indigenous Canadians is to transmit cultural knowledge through an education system that is primarily Eurocentric. The broader responsibility is to develop a system that incorporates, advocates, and teaches Indigenous ways of knowing, controlled by Aboriginals. The Aboriginal Teacher Education Program (ATEP) at Queen's University (Ontario) demonstrates how these goals have been pursued within the constraints of the university environment. Fifteen ATEP components are presented that support and recognize interpersonal and community connections, culturally  relevant education, and Indigenous ways of knowing. (TD)",

Organized by subject or type of resources available, each entry lists the name of the organization or project, contact information, and a brief description. The resources in the languages and language education section are general and not specific to particular languages or tribes. The section on art, culture, heritage, and history includes museums and similar institutions. Youth fellowship resources include programs for American Indian students as well as other ethnic groups, programs that are tribe-specific, and some that are national and international in scope. Resources in  the training, technical assistance, information, and support section include services targeted specifically to American Indians students and those that address all culturally and linguistically diverse students. State-focused resources provide services that cut across resource categories. The section on periodicals and publications presents 15 journals and monographs, as well as 15 publishers and distributors that offer books, curriculum materials, audiotapes, videos, and other audiovisual materials. Appendices list the tribes in each of the five states, with contact information, and give population figures for Native Americans in the five-state region. Contains an index. (TD)",

        "author":["Gaskell, Jane"],
        "description":"The Exemplary Schools Project was a national cooperative project that identified successful Canadian secondary schools and analyzed their practices to suggest policy implications. Five issues were examined: the meaning and recognition of success; interactions between the school and its context; the influence of school structures, processes, and culture in fostering success; characteristics of student life in school; and services provided to at-risk students. From over 260 nominations, 21 diverse secondary schools were selected, including large urban schools, small rural schools, minority-language schools, and Aboriginal schools. A research team spent 20 days at each school gathering information, from which case studies, a national report, a video, and a resource archive were  developed. Chapter 1 discusses challenges facing secondary education in Canada in the 1990s. Chapter 2 describes the origins of the project, research design, school selection process, data collected, and framework for analyses. Chapter 3 describes the 21 schools studied. Chapter 4 deals with the meaning of school in terms of attendance, discipline, grades, and the relationship between social and academic learning. Chapter 5 discusses issues related to the formal curriculum, especially what constitutes the core. Chapter 6 examines the school environment and how schools respond to diversity, gender issues, student power, and at-risk students. Chapter 7 explores teacher issues such as collegiality, professional development, teaching methods, and the influence of technology. Chapter 8  discusses parent involvement, partnerships with business and community, centralization, and school choice. Chapter 9 addresses the sharing of information, school accountability, and the relevance of research. Chapter 10 includes conclusions and implications for policy and practice. Two appendices list advisory committee members and the case study schools and their reports. Contains 58 references. (TD)",

Garlitz) discusses how one school's recognition that the information revolution is creating a new mode of learning, led it to pursue funding for computers, software, and teacher training. (TD)",

        "description":"The Migrant Education Program (MEP) is a federal formula grant to states to provide migratory children aged 3-21 with services that address special needs resulting from continual educational disruption. Services can be instructional or supporting, such as social work and health. This report summarizes MEP participation information provided by state education agencies for the 1996-97 school year. Chapter 1 is an overall summary of MEP participation and staffing. Findings include: (1) in 1996-97, the number of eligible migrant children increased 5% to 734,884, based on a 12-month count; (2) students actually receiving program services decreased from the previous year during the regular term but increased significantly during the summer term; (3) the program served more children in  grades 1-6 than in any other grade span; (4) staffing increased in both terms, but the increase in summer-term staff was not in proportion to the student increase by grade; and (5) the ratio of participants to instructional staff was much higher in the regular term than in the summer term. Chapter 2 contains individual state profiles and the District of Columbia, with comparisons to national data. For each state, two pages of tables and graphs present child counts, participants by race/ethnicity and grade span, percentage of migrant students receiving each service, staffing information, projects by term type, and information on MEP extended-time projects and schoolwide programs incorporating MEP funds or services. Appendices list states not providing MEP services by term and year and  include the reporting form. Contains 29 data tables and 8 figures. (TD)",

        "description":"National math assessment data from 3,112 eighth-grade students in 123 schools were used to determine whether location (rural versus nonrural) affects student achievement when related student and school-level factors are taken into account. Findings indicate that rural schools outperformed nonrural schools in math achievement and that the competitive edge of rural schools arose from school effects beyond the influences of school composition and individual student characteristics. Rural schools tended to have a better organizational context (teacher training, safe/orderly climate, collective support) conducive to higher performance, but suffered from poor instructional conditions (in terms of classroom resources, advanced courses, and progressive instruction), which balanced out  achievement gains. Rural schools should capitalize on existing organizational and contextual strengths and also focus more effort on improving curricular and instructional weaknesses. Given that many rural students are poor and attend schools whose instructional resources and course offerings are limited, the level of their academic performance relative to their nonrural counterparts is encouraging. This study shows that rural schools can provide a model of strength worth studying and emulating. Contains 20 references and hierarchical linear regression formulas. (Author/TD)",

Data indicate that the conference's six goals--connect with colleagues, create a learning community, connect with concepts related to continuous school improvement, create personal and shared meaning, commit to continue learning with this community, and commit to continue the Quest back home--were successfully achieved, in spite of some participant discomfort with the Quest approach. Follow-up data suggest that Quest had prompted discussions within some schools concerning improvement strategies, and some schools instituted small school-improvement projects.

The symposium was more like conventional professional development activities than other Quest events, offering sessions on senior projects, creating and using rubrics to assess student work, project-based learning, student writing portfolios, Microsociety, and a process called Interview Design. Evaluation data were generated by evaluator participant observation, unstructured interviews, final evaluation feedback, and the interview design process. Most participants thought the sessions were informative and relevant. The knowledge and preparedness of presenters received the highest ratings. Recommendations included more clearly addressing the needs of elementary educators, more actively engaging attendees, and offering evidence of the  effectiveness of assessment strategies described in sessions. Appendices present session evaluation forms, final evaluation forms, session scores, and the evaluation standards checklist. Contains 16 references. (TD)",

This report describes and assesses a combined elementary and high school networks rally, held on November 2-3, 1998, near Daniels, West Virginia. Forty parents, students, teachers, and administrators from 10 elementary, high, and K-12 schools in  Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky participated. Evaluation data were generated by evaluator participant observation, unstructured interviews, two feedback forms, and pre-rally and follow-up questionnaires. Data indicate that the rally's six goals--connect with colleagues, create a learning community, connect with concepts related to continuous school improvement, create personal and shared meaning, commit to continue learning with this community, and commit to continue this Quest back home--were met very well. Participants reported that the goal of committing to continue Quest-related efforts at their schools had been best achieved, and many communicated a variety of plans they intended to undertake. Attendees also found the strategies modeled by Quest staff for data  collection and needs assessment and the review of the Quest framework for continuous improvement quite useful.

This report describes and assesses a high school network rally, held on February 15-16, 1999, and a Quest Scholars meeting held on February 14, 1999, in Roanoke, Virginia. Teams consisting of students, teachers, parents, and administrators from six  high schools attended, for a total of 36 participants. At the Scholars' meeting, five participants and Quest staff planned a summer symposium and discussed how schools might collect data to document their Quest journey. Rally evaluation data were generated by evaluator participant observation, unstructured interviews, and three feedback forms.

        "description":"The Leadership to Unify School Improvement Efforts (LUSIE) project worked with school leadership teams from 11 schools in 3 West Virginia county districts to create school plans for improvement. The school leadership teams, a total of 66 people representing a cross-section of each school community, accomplished this at four retreats held in Charleston, West Virginia, in 1996 and 1997. At the fourth retreat, LUSIE participants wrote a guide for other West Virginia schools involved in creating state-required Unified School Improvement Plans. Telephone interviews conducted with 23 participants found that most participants seemed pleased with LUSIE and their resultant school plans, although some expressed skepticism concerning implementation of the plans. Many noted their  appreciation of the opportunity to communicate with other educators and people concerned about education. Several respondents said they had developed new competence in communicating and organizing change. The three students interviewed felt the proceedings were irrelevant or ineffective. The evaluation resulted in the following recommendations: integrate students more fully into LUSIE activities; initiate follow-up activities to support schools in the implementation of their plans; and address the concerns of those who noted a disjuncture between theoretical considerations and the practical applications of the work accomplished. Two appendices present the interview protocol and the evaluation standards checklist. (TD)",

        "author":["Lawrence, Barbara Kent"],
        "description":"There is an immense gap between the success that Maine's elementary school children achieve on national tests and the rate at which they go on to postsecondary education. This gap is not explained by Maine's low per capita income. Maine's homogeneous population created a culture valuing hard work, independence, pragmatism, family, community, tolerance of eccentricity, and love of the land, yet displaying characteristics of &quot;peasant&quot; society such as fatalism, pettiness, and insularity. Children are taught to respect adults, work hard, and graduate from high school, but the culture does not value postsecondary education. The state's history also impacts its educational system. Into the economic void resulting from the Civil War came paying guests searching for a romantic vision of  Maine. Some visitors had different values and made local people serving them feel inferior, a pattern that continues. This dissertation examines the influence of culture and individual and collective histories on academic aspirations through an ethnographic case study of the small town of Tremont on Mount Desert Island, a resort area of rural Maine. Chapters discuss (1) research methods; (2) the development of self and aspirations; (3) the culture and history of Tremont, Maine, and the conflict between native and dominant cultures; (4) the history of Maine; (5) a portrait of Tremont; (6) schooling on Mount Desert Island; (7) the Tremont community and elementary school; (8) students' transition to the consolidated high school; (9) interviews about factors that influence student decisions  about postsecondary education; and (10) conclusions and parallels to other rural experiences. An epilogue offers suggestions that build on the strengths of Tremont's people. Appendices describe the Student Aspirations Survey and present survey results. Contains tables, figures, charts, photographs, and 189 references. (Author/TD)",

        "description":"This report's introductory section notes that both rural and gifted education have received relatively little funding and national attention, and few studies have considered the two issues in tandem. As a first step in the process of strengthening the education of gifted rural students, this report assesses the current state of gifted rural education. Section 2 gives a brief history of rural education in America, noting that today's educational model is essentially a continuation of the common school movement of the mid-1800s, whose emphasis on standardized age and ability grouping resulted in consolidation efforts that are still ongoing. Section 3 recounts the history of gifted education; notes that it has continually been sabotaged by myths and stereotypes; and presents the  latest two misconceptions, about the benefits of technology and higher standards. Section 4 reiterates the fact that there is little information of any depth regarding rural and gifted education and cites three recommendations for research into rural gifted education. Section 5 examines the variety of definitions of \"rural,\" and the frustration this causes. Section 6 discusses the unique qualities of rural schools and their implications for gifted education. Sections 7 and 8 present survey results concerning school characteristics in the 20 most rural states, and gifted education practices and obstacles in rural schools. Section 9 proposes seven recommendations for providing effective programming for gifted rural students. Appendices present survey forms, related tables and figures, 71  resources, and 154 references.

        "description":"In 1994, four New York City school reform organizations joined to form the New York Networks for School Renewal (NYNSR) and received the first Annenberg Challenge urban grant. NYNSR goals are to expand the number of small, excellent public schools in New York City neighborhoods, particularly those with few educational options; encourage the spread of practices that help students succeed; build supportive small school networks; and advocate for increased school autonomy. Whether as new schools or as large schools redesigned into small units, small scale has been the key. NYNSR schools average 300 students. Many schools utilize service learning and internships, and all have partnerships with local organizations and universities to connect students to the responsibilities of  citizenship and work. Because of their own distinct approaches, NYNSR schools are often compared to charter schools. Examples are given of NYNSR schools focusing on global studies, the arts, inclusive programs, limited English speaking immigrants, environmental action, and family needs. Starting with 80 small schools as models, NYNSR now includes 140 small public schools serving more than 50,000 city students. These schools include more African-American, Latino, and poor students than other public schools. Attendance is up, parent satisfaction is high, graduation rates exceed city averages, and the dropout rate is less than one-half that of large schools. Contains a map showing school locations; addresses, phone, and fax numbers of NYNSR schools; a list of NYNSR school networks; brief  descriptions of sponsoring partners; consultative council members; a fact sheet; photographs; and a list of other NYNSR publications.

        "description":"Principals from small and rural elementary, middle, and high schools in Texas participated in a 3-year study of the role of the school counselor and the extent of collaborative efforts between counselors and principals. Principals reported a strong dependence on the assistance their counselors provided, often crediting them with assuming the duties of an assistant principal. Most counselors were responsible for the school's testing program and for coordinating student services with community agencies. Counselors were reported as being good listeners; giving good guidance; and being positive and supportive to students, teachers, families, and principals. Counselors provided a thermometer of campus morale in a nonthreatening manner. Principals expressed regret concerning activities  that diverted counselors from individual student counseling, such as extra administrative duties, testing, student college preparatory work, and paperwork. When asked about expanding counselors' role, most principals felt their counselors were overextended as it was. Most principals without counselors reported that they assumed the counselor role, and all felt their schools suffered for the deficit. Conclusions from the study were that counselors were in high demand; they assisted principals with many noncounseling duties; and if noncounseling activities were eliminated or redirected to other staff, counselors would have more time for student counseling, which would lead to greater job satisfaction and student productivity. Due to financial constraints, the prognosis is not good for  additional help for either principals or counselors; therefore, fostering and developing the relationship between them is critical. (TD)",

        "description":"A 4-week study at Goshen (Indiana) Middle School examined the internal and external factors affecting Hispanic student achievement. Data were collected through classroom observation, student interviews, and a survey of Latino parents. Although teacher responses to Hispanic student classroom participation were always positive, student responses, from Anglos and Hispanics alike, were less positive. When Hispanic students were given equitable response opportunities, grades improved an average of 10 percent. When the teacher was within an arm's length, Hispanic students stayed on task more, seemed more focused, attempted assignments more readily, completed work more accurately, and submitted more completed assignments. Teacher proximity resulted in grades improving 10 percent for  some students, more for others, and not significantly for those already achieving satisfactorily. When Hispanic students sat together, work was turned in 15 percent more often, accuracy improved 10 percent, and grades improved. The rephrasing and reviewing of material in Spanish when Hispanic students sat together led observers to believe that they processed information into long-term memory via Spanish. The study found that it was important to Hispanic students and their families to retain their ability to speak Spanish, and that when teachers spoke Spanish in class, Hispanic students' grades improved. Results of the parent survey indicate that Hispanic parents were very supportive of their children's education but that communication between school and home was poor. Exploration of  external factors led to the following recommendations: teachers should learn and use Spanish, occasionally let Hispanic students take assessments in Spanish, and build relationships with Hispanic students and their families.

Based upon principles of inquiry, collaboration, and action research, Quest supports and investigates ongoing school improvement efforts through rallies, summer symposia, a Scholars program, visits to participating schools, communication via listserv and mailings, and the creation of a Quest network of schools. This report describes and assesses an elementary school network rally and a Quest Scholars meeting held in February 1999 in Lexington, Kentucky. Teams of students, teachers, parents, and administrators from each of six elementary schools attended the  rally, for a total of 28 participants, and 5 Quest Scholars attended their meeting. Rally activities included a demonstration of the California Protocol, an interactive process to engage the entire school in the school improvement process; a session on brain-based learning; and alignment of teams' school improvement plans with Quest support activities. Evaluation data were generated by evaluator participant observation, unstructured interviews, and three feedback forms. Data indicate that the rally's six goals--connect with colleagues, create a learning community, connect with concepts related to continuous school improvement, create personal and shared meaning, commit to continue learning with this community, and commit to continue this Quest back home--were met very well; connecting  with colleagues and commitment to the Quest learning community were achieved best.

        "description":"This study attempted to show that students that are classified as visual learners will score higher on standardized tests than those students that are classified as non-visual learners because visual learners possess the traits needed to do well on standardized tests. The study used (33) visual and (33) non-visual adult learners in the adult basic educational program at Putnamville Correctional Facility as the sample group. The Vocational Learning Styles Inventory, Piney Mountain Press, Inc., was used to determine the learning style of each student in the study. The Test for Adult Basic Education (T.A.B.E.) was the standardized test administered. The mean scores were taken from both groups in the areas of vocabulary, comprehension, math concepts, and math computation. The mean  scores from each group were compared using a computer program which calculated an independent two tailed t-test score for each area. Standard deviation, t-values, and significance was calculated for each area tested. The visual learners group had higher mean scores than the non-visual learners group in all areas assessed.

        "description":"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the knowledge base of prospective science teachers. An important part of their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) consists of concerns about teaching. Most of the research on these concerns is focused on rather general teaching issues, and little is known about their concerns dealing with teaching specific science issues. This paper presents an exploratory study of prospective teachers' concerns about teaching a central issue in science: linking macroscopic phenomena with microscopic particles and symbolic representations such as formulas and equations. Teaching this issue evokes a lot of students' conceptual difficulties, and for that reason, may evoke pedagogical content concerns (PCC) among prospective teachers. In this  naturalistic case study, prospective teachers (n=8) were interviewed before and after the first two weeks of lessons about relevant topics at a macro-micro symbolic interface. The semi-structured interviews and the lessons were audiotaped and analyzed. The results reveal a number of important characteristics of the nature of the development of prospective science teachers' PCC. Implications of the study for science teacher education are discussed.

        "description":"This study investigated the influence that family and community cultures have on the teaching and learning of science in an after-school program. The Family Science Project provided an environment for third and fourth grade children to learn science with their parents, other adults, and middle school students. Sessions were held once a week for approximately one and one-half hours for six to eight weeks in the Fall and Spring semesters over two years. The middle school students, called the \"Junior Scientists,\" assisted elementary children and at the same time learned science with them and with the adults. The 20 participants were interviewed at the beginning of the program and at the end of one year. The study found that the self-esteem of students and parents increased as a  result of the program. All of the groups discussed in this study (parents, elementary and middle school students) were able to form positive images of scientists, and the middle school students seem to have developed meaningful science skills. Also, parents felt their children were better able to stay attentive and focused in their science and math classes. Contains 21 references. (Author/WRM)",

However, it is a challenge to teach so that students build understanding of multiplication of fractions, extending what they have already learned about fractions and about multiplication of whole numbers. This paper describes three days of instruction with fifth grade students in March during the school year.

Taoism posits a holistically cosmological view on the universe as an organic Whole and illuminates that there is always a tendency to establish a dynamic balance within the Universe. Based on these characteristics and the belief that, to a certain degree, relationships exist between Taoism, modern science, and the contemporary environmental crisis, this paper attempts to render a number of implications for science education including: (1) providing a philosophical ground  to loosen the tension resulting from current arguments on science education research in the postmodern era; (2) setting an alternative possibility for developing science curricula; and (3) serving as a practical ideology for self-reflection on science teaching.

Research suggests that teachers can improve parent involvement by strengthening home-school connections and improving teacher-parent relationships. The product of this project, a handbook on home learning and parent involvement, provides suggestions for teachers on how to improve parent involvement, strengthen home-school connections, and encourage positive parent-child interaction at home. The last section of the handbook is a comprehensive guide that lists  learning experiences parents can provide their children at home in order to promote development in literacy, math, and science.

Based on interviews with college women (n=18) who invested at least two years in college science, the nature and source of women's conflicting future images, or clash of future selves, when considering science careers is described. Women identified three kinds of clashes: (1) type of person; (2) lifestyle choices; and (3) purpose of science work. The source of these clashes was the discord between the images projected by people in the field and students' desired future images. Students questioned whether they were in the right field because they were unable to identify images that were consonant with their desired future images. Specifically, the students' positive image of  being \"collaborative\" clashed with the field's negative projected image of being \"competitive\", the positive image of \"combining family and career\" clashed with the negative projected image of \"being childless and unbalanced\", the positive image of scientific work as \"contributing to society\" clashed with the negative projected image of scientific work as done \"for the money or sake of science\". In order to help them work through these conflicts, the students turned to others for mentoring. As a consequence, some students pursued other fields while others shifted to different careers within the field, and a few took steps to redefine the field through creative uses of mentoring. Implications for further research on future images and mentoring are discussed. Contains 16 references.  (Author/WRM)",

Using Walberg's Educational Productivity Model as a framework, this study estimated the influence of home environment, quality and quantity of instruction, use of out-of-school time, peers, perceptions about the usefulness of mathematics in the future, and school socio-economic status on mathematical achievement and attitude outcomes for students of various ethnic backgrounds. Transcript and survey data representing the factors were collected from 10,001 students who participated in all of the first three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Regression analyses  indicated that the relationship between educational productivity factors with both mathematics achievement and attitudes were no different for African Americans than for members of other ethnic groups. In addition, the analyses indicated that even though there were differences in mathematics achievement between African Americans and other ethnic groups, they were substantially diminished when differences in productivity factors with respect to ethnicity were controlled.

Four case studies of professional development are synthesized in this report which discusses those decision points or dilemmas common to the cases. Professional development decisions related to philosophical versus pragmatic focus, depth versus breadth of the teacher target audience, and adoption versus development of curriculum are discussed. A framework for planning and analyzing  professional development programs is also presented. (WRM)",

The general hypothesis of this research is that the process of mathematical acculturation is influenced overall by students' metacognitive activity in relation to the interest and motivation they feel in the learning situations in which they find themselves. With the participation of 26 students in Puvirnituq (also known by the name of Povungnituk) in Quebec, Canada, data was collected through tests, questionnaires, tape recordings, and interviews. The first phase involved 12 students in French-speaking classes; the second phase  involved 14 students in mathematics classes. It was concluded that notwithstanding the relatively universal character of mathematical concepts and the symbolism through which human beings are able to make use of them effectively, every community develops its own mathematical instruments.

The first component is titled &quot;Essays in American History,&quot; and is accompanied by a bibliographic essay. The guide represents the &quot;crossroads&quot; model of curriculum development that begins with three strategic junctures of history education: (1) at grades 7 and 8, where a natural &quot;crossroads&quot; already exists between elementary and secondary education, between childhood and adolescence, and between an interest in the concrete and a capacity to grapple with the abstract; (2) in the first year of postsecondary education, where students are taking surveys of U.S. history, government, and education that can provide a critical juncture between secondary and postsecondary education; and (3) in capstone experiences of  postsecondary education, notably social studies methods and student teaching. Essays in Part One-I examine the substantive themes of continuity and change that knit together the 12 chronological periods of U.S. history. Following an introduction, the essays are: (1) &quot;A World of Their Own: The Americas to 1500&quot;; (2) &quot;Contact: Europe and America Meet, 1492-1620&quot;; (3) &quot;The Founding of New Societies, 1607-1763&quot;; (4) &quot;What Was the American Revolution? 1760-1836&quot;; (5) &quot;The Ambiguous Democracy, 1800-1848&quot;; (6) &quot;'Now We Are Engaged in a Great Civil War,' 1848-1880&quot;; (7) &quot;'What, Then, Is This American?' 1865-1900&quot;; (8) &quot;Waves of Reform, 1880-1921&quot;; (9) &quot;Boom and Bust, 1921-1933&quot;; (10) &quot;The Age of Franklin D.

Bernstein, is intended for students in grades 9 - 12 and refines and extends the understanding of U.S. history that students have acquired to date.

The paper reiterates the most promising features of the national campaign for history education reform: (1) basic history education should include fundamentals knowledge and an understanding of the way such knowledge is discovered and verified; and (2) knowledgeable students of history are best taught by instructors who have a deep background in the subject-matter-content of history and a thorough understanding of effective ways to help students learn the content and skills of history.

Subjects selected for the research study included Swedish male and female teachers, and doctoral students in business administration. The research instrument used required subjects to watch a video series that presented a vision of the U.S. society during the 1970s. The subjects were then asked to respond to questions regarding how they imagine themselves living in that society. Responses were expected to reflect initial assumptions that (1) competition implies selection; (2) selection implies independence; and (3) independence implies success. The subjects' notions of  himself or herself as competent and successful in the simulated situation appears to be at stake. Subjects who emerge from &quot;certainty in preferential judgment&quot; concerning the possibility to integrate are seen as demonstrating a fundamental psychological expression of competence. Subjects' competence is judged in terms of perceived appropriateness in ability to meet the demands of certain environments. Findings suggest that Swedish citizens imagine potential life quality within simulated society in terms relative to self-judgments regarding their own competence or success in real-life situations.

Five knowledge communities, based on postmodernist notions, and their advocates have made significant contributions to the field of comparative education. These contributory notions include: (1) postmodern deconstruction; (2) semiotic society; (3) radical alterity; (4) social Cartography; and (5) reflexive practitioners. After discussing each knowledge community and its chief educational advocates, the last position to be the most productive stance for comparative educators is proposed. It is suggested  that reflexive practitioners are well positioned to compare and map multiple interpretations of social and educational life, and become cognizant of views from the margins. For this reason, reflexive practitioners may envision appropriate options for action and enlarge the scope of vision and diversity within the educational milieu. (Contains 55 footnotes.) (MM)",

Compilers of the review used and commented on available statistical information and Scottish studies relevant to minority ethnic groups and their education at all levels. The intent of the review was to determine whether people from minority ethnic groups living in Scotland receive equitable treatment in the Scottish educational system. The review concludes that some attention has been paid to the development of policies supporting the education of children, young people, and adults from minority ethnic groups. However, there is scant monitoring or evaluation in this area and little major funding to research in this field. Research has been directed  more towards raising awareness than towards rigorous investigation. Priorities regarding future research, monitoring, and evaluation are identified.

The guide points out that civics should be a central concern from kindergarten through twelfth grade. It is through systematic instruction in civics and government that young people develop and apply the intellectual and participatory skills that result in an understanding of what government of the people, by the people, and for the people really means. Students acquire the skills to think critically about a policy issue and become competent participators in the political process. The four content standards for civics are: (1) to understand the purposes of government and the  basic constitutional principles of the U.S. republican form of government; (2) to know the structure and function of local, state, and national government and how citizen involvement shapes public policy; (3) to know the political relationship of the United States and its citizens to other nations and to world affairs; and (4) to understand how citizens exercise the roles, rights, and responsibilities of participation in civic life at the local, state, and national levels. Each standard presents a rationale, contains subdivisions, and lists specific educational objectives for grades K-4, grades 5-8, and grades 9-12.

The three content standards for economics are that students understand: (1) that because of the condition of scarcity, decisions must be made about the use of resources; (2) how different economic systems impact decisions about the use of resources and the  production and distribution of goods and services; and (3) the results of trade, exchange, and interdependence among individuals, households, businesses, governments, and societies.

Standards provide a positive and substantive framework for those who teach young people why and how the visual arts are valuable to them individually and as participants in a shared culture. The five content standards for the visual arts are : (1) to recognize and use the visual arts as a form of communication; (2) to know and apply elements of  art, principles of design, and sensory and expressive features of visual arts; (3) to know and apply visual arts materials, tools, techniques, and processes; (4) to relate the visual arts to various historical and cultural traditions; and (5) to analyze and evaluate the characteristics, merits, and meaning of works of art.

Suggested activities accompany the chapters and describe rather than prescribe instructional practice that is aligned with the standards. Each chapter begins with an overview of the core understandings covered by each standard and a sequence that traces the major concepts and themes students must grasp as they progress from kindergarten through twelfth grade. A resources section at the end of each activity directs teachers to the kinds of materials that are available for curriculum development, lesson planning, and enrichment.

        "description":"This guide to the New Mexico arts content standards and benchmarks provides a coherent structure to guide curriculum, instruction, and assessment. When developing these content standards and benchmarks for the arts, the writing committees considered and appreciated the importance of the arts to education. Some of the ideas and beliefs in the guide are that the arts, like science, are about discovery and invention; the arts, like mathematics, are about systematic divisions of time and space; the arts, like language studies, are about creativity, communication, and interpretation; and the arts, like sports, are about pushing to the limit for a singular achievement and working cooperatively to accomplish a goal. In this guide, the eight standards represent the four arts disciplines:  (1) visual art, (2) dance, (3) theater/drama, and (4) music. Arts content standards and benchmarks in the guide are based on three unifying concepts: (1) learning in the visual and performing arts is grounded in production and performance; (2) learning in, about, and through the visual and performing arts develops imaginative, critical, and reflective thinking, as well as problem-solving skills; and (3) learning in, about, and through the visual and performing arts incorporates an understanding of cultural and historical contexts. The guide lists benchmarks under groupings for grades K-4, grades 5-8, and grades 9-12. (BT)",

        "description":"Created for the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) in-service program at Webster University (St. Louis, Missouri), this series of seminars, presented over a 9-day period, focuses on a comparative study of four operas set in the time period of the French Revolution. The operas examined are: (1) Mozart's &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1786); (2) Beethoven's &quot;Fidelio&quot; (1805); (3) Giordano's &quot;Andrea Chenier&quot;; and (4) Poulenc's &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot; (1955). In addition to an extensive survey of the philosophical and historical background and events of the French Revolution, participants analyze not only how these operatic works reflect aspects of the period under study but also the relationship between the operas and the literary works upon which each opera is based. Corresponding  literary and philosophical materials include Beaumarchais'&quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1784), a selection of poems by Andre Chenier, Gertrude von le Fort's novelette &quot;The Song at the Scaffold&quot; and its dramatization by Georges Bernanos (1949), and selected writings of Condorcet, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and John Locke. Application to the curriculum also is emphasized. Contains a 21-item bibliography. (Author/BT)",

The guide states that the goals and objectives of the framework parallel the national social studies curriculum standards and reflect the national content standards for history,  geography, civics and government, and economics. These goals and objectives provide guidance for implementing the strands for each of the social science disciplines within the subject framework. The guide also explains that the social studies framework identifies four skills that are to be taught within the context of applying knowledge. Students are given numerous opportunities to practice, refine, and apply the following broad skills through a sequentially developed K-12 program: (1) acquisition of information from a variety of sources; (2) use of information for problem solving, decision making, and planning; (3) development of skills in interpersonal relationships and social participation; and (4) promotion of civic participation. An instructional model for the natural integration of  content and skills for each of the four skills is identified and elaborated upon and specific examples are provided. (BT)",

The Proficiency-based Admission Standards System (PASS) has identified six proficiency areas and the performance criteria for determining proficiency. The first four proficiencies focus on the ability to understand, interpret, and appreciate the arts. The fifth represents ability to exhibit skill in one of the four disciplines of the arts: drama, visual arts, music, and dance. The last describes ability to analyze artistic works. Students from Oregon public high schools may demonstrate proficiency by: (1) meeting designated scores on local tests and (2) producing work that is  compiled into collections of evidence. Teachers evaluate this body of work by comparing it with the standards. Only one level of performance is described since assessors make a single judgment that the student's work does or does or does not meet the standards for admission. The standards also may be used by teachers to plan instruction and assessment for high school art students. (MM)",

        "description":"A research project explored the potential of collegial coaching and reflective dialogue as mechanisms for school leaders to use to significantly alter the organizational context so that cultural change might occur. The study investigated the possibility that collegial coaching, reflection, and dialogue about teaching practices may provide an environment conducive to meaningful change. The research design was ethnographic and qualitative in nature. Data were collected within a naturalistic setting with participant observation playing a major role. Participants were a principal, who served also as a researcher, six teachers paired into three collegial coaching teams, and an administrative peer, who assumed the role of impartial observer and interviewer. The setting was a middle  school with a 390-student population in grades 4 through 7, located in a rapidly growing area of a midwestern state that is becoming increasingly suburban. Initially, teacher participants received training in collegial coaching, dialoguing, and written and oral reflection. Three data sources were used to determine the effects of collegial coaching in combination with reflection on participant teachers' classroom practices and about their attitudes and perceptions toward professional growth. Data were analyzed using constant comparison techniques. At the conclusion of the study, formal analyses of data resulted in development of a case report. Dialogue among the participants of the coaching teams and the principal provided insight into how their interactions impacted the culture of this  middle school. This case illustrates how the collegial coaching process could be used as an alternative supervisory strategy to the more traditional methods used. In order to create meaningful change, individuals must develop an understanding of their theories-in-use and their espoused theories. Contains 23 references. (BT)",

        "description":"This Digest describes how, by connecting service, social studies, and citizenship, civic educators have the potential to begin the new millennium by initiating a &quot;Century of the Caring Citizen&quot;. Effective methods for bring about the caring citizen are to allow students to learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized experiences that meet actual community needs; to integrate service into students' academic curriculum and provide structured time for thinking, talking, or writing about the service activity; to provide students with opportunities to use newly acquired skills and knowledge in real-life situations in their own communities; and to enhance what is taught in schools by extending learning into the community and help foster the development of a  sense of caring for others. Research indicates that well-conceptualized, well-administered service programs produce positive changes in students, including increased social and personal responsibility, more favorable attitudes toward adults, growth in moral and ego development, and increased self-esteem. For social studies teachers to effectively implement service-learning, they should be involved in service activities in their pre-service training by participating in classrooms where service learning projects are taking place. Existing guidelines on service-learning describe the important components of high-quality programs: (1) provide choice and challenge to students; (2) connect schools and communities in positive ways that meet real needs; and (3) engage in ongoing program assessment  and evaluation.

In 1997, NACME distributed surveys to 87 NACME scholars with CSP internships and their  supervisors. The surveys examined their satisfaction with the program. Results indicated that successful mentoring made a significant difference, contributing substantially to interns' interest in returning to their host companies and their overall evaluation of workplace experiences. Students and supervisors differed significantly in how they viewed and interpreted the experience. The investigation led to four recommendations: recognize the value of teaming; invest time in developing engineering talent; respect the ambition and abilities of interns; and engage interns in exploring future possibilities.

        "description":"High quality education for all students is promoted nationwide. University teacher educators must deal with reality as they provide instruction for prospective teachers. If schools and teachers are to improve, then college faculty must also improve. This must be a unified effort in which higher education institutions work with existing and new faculty to create an equitable situation. All parties in the educational system must work together to produce a more respectful, humane treatment of people involved in education. The key is to help systems self-organize and transform themselves. This paper examines what recent brain-based research says about professors' self-esteem and discusses how universities can intervene when teachers need better training. It examines influences that  change idealistic new faculty members, noting how they relate to prospective teachers and focusing on: utilizing prior teaching experience; the effect of pecking order on college faculty; and economic rewards for college faculty. The paper discusses factors that can influence the societal view of teacher education (historical events, international changes, and national accreditation agencies). Finally, the paper discusses the need for faculty empowerment, emphasizing the need for clear, organized orientation; cleanup of the pecking order; cross-disciplinary research; sharing of faculty members' positive actions; more innovative techniques; an authentic task approach; action research; portfolio development; and technology use.

(2) how might these positions, or knowledge communities, be interrelated and mapped as sites in an intertextual field? and (3) using this heterotopia of conflicting views in one place, what might be reasonably concluded about the postmodern challenge of multiperspectivism  and its impact on how comparativists might choose to construct and represent their world?

        "description":"This paper examines the latest elementary, middle school, and district level Maryland student achievement and teacher experience data to argue that schools today are segregated not only along student backgrounds, but also along teacher expertise. The very students who need school the most to break out of the intergenerational cycle of poverty and diminished opportunities also lack access to teachers who have the expertise to provide them quality teaching. The paper describes the School-University Partnership to Prepare Outstanding Responsive Teachers (SUPPORT) Project between a Maryland university and four of the five largest local educational agencies in Maryland, which begins to redress a number of these structural inequities. Project SUPPORT uses tests and access to teacher  data to better prepare teachers and to more equitably allocate educational resources to schools. Finally, the paper proposes a number of recommendations to provide disadvantaged students access to quality teachers, including (1) revamping teacher education by moving to an apprenticeship model of teacher preparation, (2) connecting public school teaching rewards to teaching assignment difficulty, and (3) holding universities accountable for the quality of teachers they produce.

The study asked whether differences in how districts and schools provided staff development for teachers accounted for some of the variation in student achievement across Georgia schools. Researchers selected a sample of higher and lower achieving schools across a range of socioeconomic status levels. A total of 60 schools in 35 districts participated. At each school, researchers interviewed administrators and conducted focus group discussions with teachers. They also surveyed 1,150 teachers in all of the schools. At each district office, researchers interviewed staff development coordinators, personnel directors, and  finance directors to determine the context in which staff development occurred in schools. Results indicated clear differences in the approach to staff development in higher and lower achieving schools. This report examines similarities and differences related to decision-making processes, content, focus, providers, strategies for providing time, format and delivery, teachers' views on support, leadership at the school, role of the district office, and training of leadership in guiding staff development. The report also examines Georgia's staff development policies. Three recommendations were made for staff development: improving low achieving schools, increasing capacity for staff development, and using incentives to increase the use of research-based staff development.

        "description":"Teachers who leave the classroom to become principals often have difficulty adjusting to the new job responsibilities. A caring attitude may alleviate much of the stress associated with these administrative obligations. However, caring on the job is viewed as a weakness. This finding has led to the investigation of factors related to a caring administrator. The present research examines whether being a caring administrator provides growing opportunities outside of the classroom for teachers desiring a career change. The paper begins by reviewing literature on the definition of caring from various perspectives and on caring as it relates to school administration. Next, it investigates documented experiences of schools where caring exists. Finally, it concludes that effective  schools nearly always have caring principals who are not afraid to give up power. Caring presents opportunities for administrators to grow as humans and for other people to grow from administrators' relationships with others. New administrators could feel more at ease with their new job responsibilities if they are perceived as caring. Recommendations include offering future administrators a graduate course on moral development; having professors of school leadership inform students of the aspect of caring and its implications on development; and informing current principals of the powers of caring.

Researchers investigated: 1) whether teacher behaviors perpetuated sex stereotypes; 2) whether teachers gave more attention to either gender; 3) levels of student participation; 4) opportunities for student participation; and 5) gender equity in instructional materials. The researchers worked in five rural Missouri high schools, using cluster sampling in two classrooms in each school. Surveys of students and teachers included 13 questions on gender equity and attitudes. Researchers also used two observation instruments (one on teacher behavior and interaction and the other on embedded discrimination). Results indicated that: student-teacher interactions were perpetuating  gender stereotypes; teachers gave more attention to male students; male students received more of the higher-thinking-skills questions; male students interacted more with teachers (though students perceived that both genders interacted equally); male students received more opportunities for participation in the classroom; and instructional materials were gender equal.

The paper suggests that small program size makes possible the development and implementation of fruitful programming, since it is easier to conduct the sustained conversation needed to create a well-designed program. The paper begins by examining the complexities and contradictions that accompany large programs, which are typically staffed with a faculty representing a wide variety of specializations. This specialization can lead to segmented and fragmented programming. Next, the paper discusses the advantages  of small faculties, including a broadened sense of responsibility, more ability to meet as a group, more ability to talk outside of formal meetings, and the ability to take advantage of vertical staffing. Finally, the paper examines how to achieve the advantages of smallness. Two suggested strategies are the multiple models strategy and the program-within-a-program strategy. (Contains 26 references.)

After introducing the topic and discussing the need for continuous teacher training, the paper presents information on general theoretical premises and the construct of change. It goes on to discuss the specific theoretical model (the recursive schemata of Mounoud). Next, it describes a training course, based on Mounoud's theoretical principals, that involved 35 primary school teachers (all of whom had a university degree in psychology or pedagogy and were willing to undergo theoretical study and subsequent assessment of the learning achieved).  In the training model, mentors held the role of mediator between theory and practice and between university and school. A study of the course indicated that it allowed teachers to gain a knowledge of the whole developmental process and to reflect on how social, affective, and cognitive elements were interwoven in their students' daily lives. Surveys of the teachers indicated that they accepted the theoretical issues when they were allowed to consider theory as a useful tool for intervening more efficiently at the operative level. Overall, the researchers concluded that the intervention model and contents of the course were effective. (Contains 69 references.) (SM)",

Researchers examined multicultural calendar artifacts as objects that documented approaches to multicultural curriculum and investigated how students constructed meaning and interpreted multicultural curriculum questions. Participants were career-change students in a Global Perspectives course designed to promote self-reflection (e.g., examining taken-for-granted presuppositions and stereotypical biases). Students had to create and present multicultural calendars intended for actual future use in teaching. The calendars were designed for constructing multicultural meanings  intrapersonally and interpersonally. Students had to present their calendars during class and receive feedback. Study data included original calendar artifacts and their accompanying materials, videotapes of students' class presentations, instructors' and students' interactive observations and feedback, audiotaped discussions between instructors as they interpreted the calendars, student writings, and course evaluations. Results indicated that the multicultural calendars showed how graduate career-change student teachers envisioned their future work in curriculum making, teaching, and holistic evaluations. Creating multicultural calendars enabled students to get in touch with their ideas and beliefs about approaching diverse students and curriculum and become confident in contributing to  a school community. The calendars made possible an exchange of views between colleagues interested in developing students' global perspectives. (Contains 51 references.) (SM)",

The purpose of the research was to find whether the personal results of taking an achieving styles inventory could provide a means of promoting self-reflection (in this case, for undergraduate teacher education students engaged in experiential learning). The study sample was 19 students, 18 female and 1 male, participating in an undergraduate reading methods class which stressed field experience in an urban preservice program. The Achieving Styles Inventory (Lipman-Blumen &amp; Leavitt, 1985) was completed in class during the Spring 1997 semester. Results were tabulated and returned by the instrument's designer. Quantitative results are reported and  analyzed. Qualitative data collection and analysis subsequent to the previous presentation appear in this paper. Five of the six students for whom qualitative data were collected tied their results to their prospective teaching careers. The analysis of these responses indicate that the Achieving Styles Inventory instigated self-reflective behavior on the part of these students. Further research will include collection of additional data from students who did not respond to the followup questionnaire. (Contains 19 references.) (Author/SM)",

        "description":"This paper describes how preservice teachers at Sweden's Linkoping University are prepared to become reflective practitioners. Students participate in a pedagogical seminar group that meets monthly. Within the group, they discuss matters important to all teachers and examine reflective texts that they had to write at the beginning of their teacher education program. These texts offer a presentation of themselves and a summary of how they regard teachers' work. Students also formulate their expectations prior to beginning each of several student teaching experiences. These introductory thoughts constitute a background for the personal journal the students keep during their teaching practice. After each student teaching session, mentor teachers and student teachers analyze the  students' comments, then the students write reflective papers to be critiqued by the group. During the last year of their education, students write a thesis that integrates theory and practice. This model for creating reflective teachers is new at Linkoping University, so only one group has completed the entire course so far. Surveys of the students after they had worked for 1 year as teachers indicated that the course had various effects. It facilitated their introduction to work when they applied for jobs and completed interviews; strengthened their identity as teachers when they met colleagues and parents; and worked as a basis for dealing with students.

        "description":"This report argues that the most effective way to raise academic achievement is for teachers to become inquiring professionals with action-research and reflective-thinking skills. The report defines effectiveness and examines the views of various stakeholders about what qualities they value in school, arguing that effectiveness is a complex concept and only researchers can measure it correctly. Other stakeholders are concerned with different qualities and not with effectiveness. The paper argues that teacher effectiveness must be improved in order to help children achieve more. Teachers are distracted by pressures put on them by other stakeholders with different priorities. The report examines literature on school effectiveness stability and concludes that effectiveness is  unstable. It discusses different ways to restore effectiveness and notes a lack of convincing evidence for the effectiveness of externally generated initiatives. The report argues that a significant element of efforts to restore and maintain effectiveness must be the evidence-based practices of inquiring school teachers and administrators. Interviews with 35 teachers who completed a program at Leeds Metropolitan University to teach them action-research skills found significant obstacles to the school improvement effort. The report describes individual initiatives to raise students achievement, which tend to restore or maintain effectiveness. It concludes that such measures are likely to please many stakeholders whose priorities are not effectiveness. Interim recommendations for school  improvement are included. Contains 49 references.

The goal was for paraeducators to complete mathematics courses with a passing grade, to experience mathematics content using constructivist instructional approaches, and to improve their attitudes toward mathematics. During summer 1998, 22 UPDATE scholars enrolled in Algebra I, a precollege developmental mathematics course. After successfully completing this course, 21 of the paraeducators enrolled in Algebra II, another developmental course. During Fall 1998, 16 of the paraeducators who completed Algebra II enrolled in their first college-level mathematics course, Math for Early  Childhood/Elementary Teachers. Researchers administered an attitudinal survey and an instructional strategy survey. Pre and post scores on the attitudinal survey were analyzed for any significant change in paraeducators' attitudes toward mathematics. The instructional survey was administered at the end of the course to collect information about teaching methods used and to learn how these methods impacted learning. A focus group suggested that the use of manipulatives, hands-on activities, and cooperative learning groups helped UPDATE scholars learn mathematics. The surveys suggested that the mathematics courses improved paraeducators' attitudes toward mathematics. All paraeducators received a grade of C or better in the three math courses.

Participants were 33 teachers of grades 3-9 from rural, suburban, and urban schools (public, private, and home schools) in six states. Teachers had attended 17 NASA off-site workshops in which aerospace specialists worked with workshop sponsors to plan program content. The objectives of the workshops were to enhance teachers' knowledge, experiences, and skills so they could use aerospace as a vehicle for improving student learning. Researchers collected  survey data on teachers' attitudes, knowledge, and behavior before and after the workshops, and they interviewed a sample of workshop participants. They also surveyed students about knowledge, attitudes, and behavior before and after being taught with NASA resources. Findings support the NASA focus on teacher workshops, which are expected to have a ripple effect from participants to their students and colleagues. The workshops positively affected teachers' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Students and teachers supported the NASA focus on teacher workshops. (Contains 24 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"Educators concerned with the preparation of adults are aware that students engage in lengthy discussions with their peers. Increasingly, this is encouraged in educational settings through formal pedagogy. However, little is known about its value to adult cognition. In a phenomenological study investigating the professional development of degree course nursing students in the United Kingdom, the importance of informal peer narratives of experience was noted. This paper explores the findings related to that aspect of the longitudinal study using theoretical frameworks borrowed from sociocultural writers concerned primarily with children's cognition. The data indicate that storied experience was a significant factor in promoting professional development. This exemplifies Habermas's  theories of practical interest. Three categories of narrated experience were identified. This paper presents the three categories for discussion along with relevant theoretical material. It concludes that informal peer-group activities should be fostered to promote professional development and that further research into this phenomenon is necessary to gain a better understanding of its nature.

Students were asked to use e-mail letters to react and respond to some aspect of the assigned readings for the week. They exchanged their letters among each other and brought copies of their letters to class for small group discussions. At two points during the course, the professor conducted a brief evaluation by asking students to write how the course worked for them and to consider what they had done so far. Several students commented about letter writing. The students reported liking the letter writing activity for a variety of social and intellectual reasons (e.g., getting to  know other people and their views, receiving feedback, and reflecting on what they had read). All references to the letter writing activities were positive. In a subsequent curriculum theory class, the professor used letter writing again, but changed how it fit into the course evaluation. Once again, all references to letter writing in the evaluation were positive, and it was mentioned much more frequently. (Contains 13 references.) (SM)",

The inservice developed assessment approaches aligned with cooperative learning instructional approaches. Teachers were introduced to a model of collaborative assessment aimed at improving students' abilities to self-evaluate. A team of five university and school/district personnel conducted a series of three inservice sessions over 4 months. Teams of teachers from several schools were paired, with two teachers attending the first full-day inservice as trainers, working back at the school with their partners (trainees), then attending the second and third inservice sessions together. The effects of the  inservice were measured in a pre-post design which examined the impact of the inservice design on personal teaching efficacy, general teaching efficacy, commitment to authentic practices, and commitment to traditional testing practices. Data were also collected on how teachers used the four stages in the study model for teaching self-evaluation. Researchers found significant pre-post changes. Use of self-evaluation procedures increased substantially, commitment to authentic assessment practices increased, commitment to traditional assessment practices declined, and personal teaching efficacy scores were higher. The action-research-enhanced train-the-trainer approach facilitated teachers' movement toward student assessment practices congruent with the ideals of the cooperative  learning/teaching practices. This approach also succeeded in enhancing teachers' beliefs about their competence. (Contains 48 references.) (SM)",

Results indicated that all five teachers supported the essence of reform; the state education reforms impacted teachers' practice, but practice lagged behind knowledge of awareness; all five teachers worried about the assessment/accountability component of the reform; four teachers were resistant to top-down reform to some degree; and all five teachers valued a learner-centered professional development process.

The LEOTC programs provided out-of-class programs and teacher workshops and developed supporting educational resource materials to help teachers with curriculum delivery. The research looked at whether schools perceived the LEOTC programs as meeting their learning needs as expressed in the curriculum documents and what types of schools participated in LEOTC programs. Data collection included a telephone survey of 40 schools participating in  programs offered by 10 providers and an examination of relevant documents from 5 providers in the Auckland area. Data analysis indicated that LEOTC programs were playing an essential role in complementing the classroom work of teachers. Teachers considered them very valuable, especially in how they provided opportunities for hands-on experience. Providers were able to adapt the programs to meet the needs of diverse students. Some rural schools expressed a need for a wider range of programs. Teachers wanted to see more information about programs.

Data for the study came from personal interviews with 10 predominantly female teachers who were currently involved in PBL with their students. Each teacher had at least 2 years of teaching experience, and five of the teachers were PBL coordinators at their respective schools. The interviews consisted of five open-ended questions related to: their perceptions of student learning in PBL environments; the role they took with students engaged in PBL; what they did with students who were unengaged with the project; how student choice played a part in PBL; and the relationship between student choice and achievement. Results indicated that  PBL varied depending on each teacher's personal style of teaching, the needs and interests of the students, the available resources, the physical environment of the school and its surroundings, and the degree to which the school community was invested in PBL. The study concluded that learning could be greatly enhanced by incorporating student choice through PBL. (Contains 27 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This study offers a framework for identifying areas of agreement and disagreement across eight recent teacher education reform documents. Researchers analyzed each document in relation to the reform principles proposed by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (NCTAF). They developed a rubric to assess whether the documents expressed agreement or disagreement with the NCTAF principles and, if so, to determine the extent of the agreement/disagreement. The analysis indicated that, based on means and standard deviations, two principles elicited the strongest agreement: that teacher education programs should (1) include strong disciplinary preparation that incorporates an understanding of a discipline's core concepts, structure, and tools of inquiry as a foundation  for subject matter pedagogy and (2) seek to develop multicultural competence in their students. The principle that teacher education programs should add an additional year or two of graduate-level preparation beyond the traditional 4-year undergraduate degree evoked the least amount of support. The paper considers these three variables for further discussion, and it examines one principle that had mid-range level of agreement (performance assessment). Finally, the paper offers suggestions for how future inquiry into teacher education reform can benefit from recognizing areas of agreement and disagreement across a common set of principles. Two appendixes present a rubric for assessing degree of consistency/inconsistency with NCTAF principles and recommendations for reform proposals.  (Contains 16 references.) (SM)",

Data sources included students' reflective journals and students' answers to guiding questions at the beginning and end of the first and third courses. Secondary data sources included responses to each others' journals and discussions on students' roles as teacher education students, preservice teacher supervisors, course  instructors, and mentors to less experienced doctoral students. The two students developed a shared conceptualization of what it meant to be a teacher educator. Based on their beliefs about constructing knowledge and their reflections on their experiences, they viewed becoming a teacher educator as a process of intellectual development. The steps included becoming a learner, supervising preservice teachers, and thinking of themselves as teacher educators (when responsibility and accountability were attached to their roles in the graduate program).

        "description":"Arguing that transformative teacher professional development may require more than a shift in the content of teachers' thinking, this paper examines how the structure of teachers' meaning-making systems might affect their experiences in three mathematics teacher professional development programs. The paper describes the change goals of three teacher professional development programs and their methods for accomplishing those goals. SummerMath for Teachers attempts to support a shift in teachers' paradigms about mathematics and learning by asking them to personally engage with and reflect on mathematics and pedagogy. The Math Case Methods Project supports teachers in re-evaluating and complicating their ideas about mathematics and mathematics teaching through collaborative inquiry  into practice via mathematics teaching cases. The Algebra Project seeks to change the expectations of teachers, students, and the broader community about who can learn mathematics through community organizing and introduction of new curricular approaches. This study explores how the change goals and methods of the three courses might be experienced by teachers seeing through the lenses of several developmentally different perspectives posited by the theory of Robert Kegan (1982; 1994). It explains that differences in developmental frames may result in vastly different experiences within the same program. Finally, the paper raises questions about the implications of bringing an adult developmental perspective to bear on both research and teacher education practice. (Contains 56  references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This case study examined ethnic identity development within inservice teacher education. Participants were 11 white, female teachers in a summer course on multicultural education. Course readings were selected and sequenced to represent the experiences of ethnic and racial groups in American society while emphasizing intergroup power relations. The underlying assumption was that people respond to such information from their own white identity status, and through a cooperative learning process, they can move into higher statuses of healthy, nonracist white racial identity. The course drew upon psychology, sociology, and anthropology while emphasizing the dynamics between education, culture, and socioeconomic status and group and individual responses to these structures. The course  stressed the dynamics of power and oppression in institutional settings, encouraging students to respond from their own collective identity. A student-centered, cooperative-learning approach based on critical reading, thinking, interpreting, and socially constructing knowledge was used. Students read assigned materials, wrote critical reflections, and participated in discussions. Data from participant observation and students' written reflections highlighted four subgroups: the hard to reach, the resisters to change, the searchers, and those who had achieved identity. The conceptualization of nonracist white racial identity as a positive development put many participants at ease and helped them further explore their own identity. Cooperative learning created a context in which individuals  felt safe to voice and explore their opinions regarding controversial issues. (Contains 14 references.) (SM)",

In the morphological model, decision making is a core action to direct system evolution in research and development. With the engineering concept of life cycle in curriculum research and development, processes of cyclic evolution of curriculum systems from problem domain to solution domain can be identified and  supervised.

Both take a systemic approach to the problem by focusing on how specific circumstances create a reality of failure for many students. One school analyzed factors related to retention/promotion decisions and determined that four factors directly affected eventual student success: teacher beliefs in student's ability to succeed with intervention, student maturational level, parent support, and academic ability. Prior to the review, they based retention on poor attendance, lack of reading skills, and/or lack of math skills. Another school system investigated student records to determine why students had dropped out over the past 10 years. They found that third grade and seventh grade  were two hot spots that should be areas of concern for school staff. Approximately half of students who eventually dropped out were retained or had significant difficulty in third grade, and 90 percent of those who dropped out failed or experienced significant difficulty in seventh grade. Based on this information, local schools then developed and implemented strategies to enhance success and reduce the dropout rate, including grade level teams, block scheduling, success rooms, looping teachers, and an accelerated school model.

West Point's mission is to educate and train the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate shall have the attributes essential to professional growth throughout a career as an officer in the U.S. Army. West Point faculty include those who are similar to tenured faculty, rotating faculty, and civilian professors. West Point has a highly competitive cadet selection process, and class sizes are small. Each cadet is evaluated through the Leadership Evaluation and Development Ratings System. Professors regularly conference about and with cadets, providing continuous monitoring and assessment. Professors of  student teachers are strongly involved in supervisory and developmental activities. Administration is totally autocratic, there is an established procedure for everything, and there is no academic freedom. After the first academic year, cadets become team leaders and are eventually promoted to cadet officers and begin to train new cadets. West Point is competitive with other programs (e.g., state universities with ROTC programs, which are less expensive). West Point is doing many of the educational tenets that are research validated, but often are not feasible in teacher education (e.g., small class size, integrated instruction, mentoring, hands-on applications, and cohort groups of students).

A group of 32 of the university's elementary education majors were placed at school sites in the local district to spend their entire last year of education and practice. Students taught on-site within the schools and participated in the day-to-day activities of the classroom under the direction of selected mentor teachers. Researchers studied a number of different aspects of this PDS during the year. Data from interviews with participating university faculty indicated that they were satisfied with the students and the program, and they  regarded the program highly, though several critical issues needed to be addressed if the program was to continue and prosper. These issues included the distance and traveling time between the university and the participating district; ways to improve and increase the amount of communication between university faculty, students, and district mentors; the student and faculty workload and ways this workload might be more equitably distributed and scheduled; and ways of providing similar experiences to other on-campus students.

The preservice teachers were asked to complete a survey describing challenges they perceived they would encounter as future teachers required to work with culturally, linguistically, and special needs student populations. Additionally, the survey asked them to describe the skills necessary to help them face these challenges. Data analysis revealed that they had a high degree of uncertainty in teaching students with cultural and linguistic differences in comparison to teaching students with special needs. They believed that they needed courage and risk-taking skills to meet the challenge of diverse  classrooms. Few students had given serious consideration to taking teaching jobs in urban schools rather than in their own communities. Many respondents expected their employers to provide inservice training on diversity rather than being responsible for their own professional development. Respondents' understanding of diversity tended to be superficial. Respondents expected there to be communication barriers and implied that it was important for minority students to be able to understand the teachers rather than the teachers to understand them. Respondents worried about being able to create a positive learning environment with equitable treatment for all. (Contains 13 references.) (SM)",

Facing the challenge to incorporate varied innovative teaching and learning strategies, set statewide and schoolwide goals, and implement standards, schools need a systematic, consistent framework and high technology tool to bring these ideas to the classroom. In 1992, Wisconsin's 2-year college system formed a partnership to develop a high technology instructional design software package and video course that would arm them and Wisconsin school districts for the challenges ahead. The resulting system works for teachers, administrators, and learners. It integrates current theory and practice in instruction into a model that infuses broad,  transferable skills into occupational and discipline specific instruction. The Wisconsin Technical College System Foundation created software for developing and planning programs, courses, or lessons from scratch or from broad frameworks developed at the national, state, or district levels. It can create study guides and training manuals that include components of the model. Since the release of the Wisconsin Model Academic Standards in 1997, over 250 K-12 school districts have used the model and software to show how they address standards. The Instructional Design and Planning video course leads viewers through a step-by-step process for developing performance-based criteria, study guides, lesson plans, and teacher manuals. (SM)",

        "description":"The use of peer tutors has been an educational tool for centuries. Students benefit by receiving immediate clarification of information they do not understand and feedback in a nonthreatening environment. Tutors reinforce their own knowledge and skills, build their self-confidence, and develop a sense of responsibility. Students of any age and at-risk students are as capable of serving as peer tutors as any other students, and the benefits to them can be significant. Peer tutoring can also help gifted students who need to be challenged. Peer tutoring can be implemented in an attempt to cross language and cultural barriers, with older students tutoring younger students in their native languages. By utilizing peer tutoring, teachers can teach more effectively. Peer tutoring enables  teachers to focus on new materials as peer tutors reinforce materials already covered and give help to students in need. A structured system of one-to-one tutoring can afford the benefits of one-to-one instruction for large numbers of students. Peer-tutoring programs are typically more cost effective than computer-assisted instruction, reduced class size, or extended school days in improving academic achievement. Peer tutoring has the potential to increase academic engagement. Barriers to the implementation and maintenance of effective peer tutoring programs include incomplete implementation, lack of adherence to protocols by teachers, lack of administrative support for teachers, and heavy teacher workloads.

Two instructors in each of two departments (literature and psychology) at a research university in Israel were interviewed, videotaped in class, and rated by their students as to their high- and low-inference behaviors. All instructors showed that they knew many effective teaching strategies, though there was a significant number of strategies that they used without being aware of it, and there were a few strategies that they knew of but did not  use in class. Findings suggest that the main dimension of clarity and a small set of strategies are essential for effective teaching, but beyond this set, high performance on either organization or interest/engagement is not a necessary condition for excellent teaching, and each teacher achieves his/her excellence in a different way using different effective teaching dimensions and strategies.

        "description":"This study examined the relationship between elementary teachers' pedagogical beliefs and the level of their instructional computer use. Participating teachers had 2 years of experience using a computer network that provided students with an integrated learning system, several word processing packages, desktop publishing, a multimedia encyclopedia, and a presentation program. Teachers completed a 57-item questionnaire that assessed the criterion variable, level of computer use, and several independent variables (pedagogical orientation, innovativeness, computer relevance, computer self-competence, and subjective norms). One of the scales assessed pedagogical orientation and categorized teachers as having behaviorist, information-processing, or constructivist beliefs. Findings  indicated that teachers were eclectic in their pedagogical orientation. There was a negative correlation between behaviorist beliefs and level of computer use. Teachers who embraced an information-processing pedagogy had a significantly higher level of computer use than did their behaviorist counterparts. Constructivist teachers' level of computer use was slightly less than that of the information-processing teachers, but was not significantly different from either the behaviorist or information-processing group. Once the personal variables of the teacher were used to predict level of computer use, the pedagogical orientation did not significantly contribute to the prediction of the model. Recommendations were made for the refinement of the questionnaire and for continued research in the  relationship between teachers' pedagogical beliefs and instructional computer use.

        "description":"This paper reports on a longitudinal study of student teachers' perceptions of their supervision by cooperating teachers and university supervisors at a small state university. An open-ended survey gathered the opinions of 469 student teachers. Researchers coded survey responses to identify common themes about important skills or characteristics of successful cooperating teachers and university supervisors. Results highlighted 11 themes regarding cooperating teachers' supervision: guide, feedback, expert, style, power, welcome, support, ideas, cooperating teacher choice, evaluation/grades, and triad of student, cooperating teacher, and university supervisor. There were nine themes regarding supervisors: visits, support, help, feedback, availability, expectations, guide, the  triad, and grades. Results suggest that workshops and training materials for cooperating teachers and university supervisors should focus on themes that are both important to student teachers and changeable. It appears that it is important and possible to help cooperating teachers learn how to give feedback to student teachers about their teaching and how to guide them through the student teaching semester. It is necessary for university supervisors to give feedback and support as needed throughout the student teaching semester. Cooperating teacher selection criteria should focus on most important but less changeable characteristics. Universities should select cooperating teachers who are regarded as expert teachers and supervisors who have ideas to share with the student teachers they  mentor. The student teacher survey is appended. (SM)",

Participants included all 38 spring 1998 student teachers in an elementary education program at a small state university in Pennsylvania and 71 out of 75 of their cooperating teachers. A survey measured student teachers' and cooperating teachers' beliefs about behaviorist management, behaviorist teaching, constructivist teaching, and constructivist parents. Student teachers were also interviewed individually about their beliefs and student teaching experiences at the end of the semester. Results indicated that most student teachers were more constructivist and  less behaviorist than cooperating teachers. Some student teachers and cooperating teachers seemed to believe in both learning theories. Some student teachers' beliefs were changed as a result of their cooperating teachers. Cooperating teachers influenced student teachers through modeling, giving feedback, and encouraging students to take risks. This study suggests that teacher educators should focus on when to use behaviorist and constructivist learning theories rather than the superiority of either theory, and that methods courses may be more powerful in shaping students' beliefs than sometimes reported.

The development process included two phases. The first involved the collection of qualitative data from inservice teachers to ensure that the survey items were grounded in practice as well as theory. The second involved testing the survey with 137 inservice and 61 preservice teacher samples and collecting colleague ratings for a subset of the inservice teacher sample (75 individuals) to establish construct validity. Examination of factor pattern matrices for both samples combined with the researchers' own theory and experience led to the decision to condense the 27 items into four factor-based scales. Scale  statistics and correlations with colleague ratings provide initial estimates of the scales' reliability and validity and establish their adequacy for use in subsequent studies. Discussion focuses on lessons learned in the survey development as well as directions for further development and its employment in future studies. (Contains 15 references.) (Author/SM)",

The theoretical underpinnings of the Cognitive Modification Intervention (CMI) are based on Feuerstein's Theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability. Embedded in this theory is the Theory of Mediated Learning Experience, which propounds that the quality of interaction between a learner and an intentional human play a significant role in the cognitive development of the learner. The design of the intervention includes a diagnostic approach for attacking cognitive deficiencies through self-awareness and metacognitive activities; cognitive modification through mediation learning; and bridging and use of thinking tools for effective  transfer across academic and life situations. The study used four experimental and four control groups, with 18-20 students per group who participated in the intervention. Although the quantitative results of the pre- and posttests are not yet fully analyzed, the subjective experience of the mediator and qualitative feedback from the participants are encouraging. The results lend support to the school of thought that thinking can be taught and that intelligence is modifiable. (SM)",

In the early part of the second semester, teachers completed an anonymous survey in which they displayed overwhelming support for the change. Five community learning groups were established and teachers were randomly selected to serve in the communities. Each of the communities had five grades (1-5) with the exception of one group which did not have a fifth grade. With the exception of three teachers, all teachers changed classrooms the last 2 days of the school year. Three teachers remained in the same classroom. The school year began with this arrangement, and several improvements were noted. Teachers found that discipline  problems were overwhelmingly down, especially violent acts. There was an observed improvement in the social skills of all students. This paper also includes information from the research on school size, the school-within-a-school concept, and learning communities. (SM)",

Students who did not student teach or complete internships were the control group. Students who were student teaching or had internships during the fall of 1998 also completed an open-ended questionnaire. The questionnaire asked about school demographics, student teacher classroom experiences, and views of cultural harmony and disharmony with respect to race,  ethnicity, class, and gender. Data analysis indicated that there were no statistically significant changes for the total group or treatment group, though there were more positive gains than losses as indicated by students' responses to questions about their views of cultural diversity, intelligence, and other personal views. Students' views on issues of diversity provided information about their various classroom settings and schools. The data revealed complex issues, greatly disparate teaching environments, and some student awareness of issues of race, ethnicity, class, and gender in teaching. (Contains 32 references.) (SM)",

In 1997, the Georgia Professional Standards Review Commission began examining reading certification requirements and found that most teacher education programs did not require enough reading. The Commission is exploring ways to ensure that preservice teachers receive adequate content in reading. The University System of Georgia is making program improvements in reading and mathematics. Maryland's Department of Education convened a task force in 1998 to work on changes in reading content requirements for Maryland teachers. The new regulations apply to all students enrolling  in Maryland teacher education programs. The North Carolina Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction revised the Standard Course of Study for English Language Arts to provide detailed guidance on how to teach phonemic awareness and phonics. All teacher education programs must regularly demonstrate that they cover all required competencies. In Texas, a special committee of the State Board for Teacher Certification is developing revised certification requirements in reading. The Texas Education Agency has funded a Center for Reading and Language Arts at the University of Austin. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board is reviewing teacher education programs offered by public universities. Other SREB states are also working on improvements in reading instruction.

Each student received a conflict resolution journal that contained handouts for use with the conflict resolution curriculum to  help them become aware of their feelings, reactions, and personal progress in response to the curriculum. Students shared in their journals the actual conflicts they encountered and how they resolved them. Each week, they filled out a conflict journal log sheet. The project director also kept a journal to record informational observations during the 7-week conflict resolution curriculum. Data analysis indicated that there were significant changes in students' attitudes toward conflicts and how to resolve them following implementation of the curriculum. Students became more effective in resolving conflicts once they participated in the curriculum. (Contains 30 references.) (SM)",

It focused on how teachers reconsidered current teaching practices in order to reconcile the demands of higher stakes learning with progressive ideas about curriculum, instruction, and assessment. The participants undertook action research projects in which they redesigned instructional units that incorporated some of the new standards. In doing so, each participant used an assessment tool, such as a rubric, checklist, or portfolio. Data for qualitative analysis were gathered from the action research projects, participants' written reflections, focus groups, and a 6-month followup survey of  participants. Results showed that participants' students gained a more explicit understanding of the connection between learning and assessment, took responsibility for their learning, and received improved instruction. The participants gained autonomy and confidence for redesigning instruction, reached a higher level of problem- solving ability, and learned to use classroom data more effectively. Effects of the participants' action research on administrators and other teachers, however, were limited. (Contains 13 references.) (Author/SM)",

Part 1 of the questionnaire requested demographic data on the teacher and school. Part 2 discussed participants' level of need for various types of support related to curricular change. Part 3 contained open-ended questions allowing participants to individualize their responses. Focus group interviews helped  elaborate and clarify information obtained from the questionnaires. Data analysis noted the importance of providing teachers with adequate time. Teachers identified the need for time to plan, discuss, observe, and share ideas with their colleagues about the craft of teaching. There was a strong desire for school district personnel to play an important support role in convincing the public that teacher professional development time is time and money well spent. Teachers considered money to support this change process an essential resource. Respondents expressed a strong preference for support to come from colleagues and administrators. Teachers wanted additional information about assessment strategies and whole class instructional strategies to expand their professional repertoire.  (Contains 14 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This paper describes the development work and research findings of an initiative to create a statewide literacy assessment in New York to inform teaching and learning and report on group performance trends. The Early Literacy Profile (ELP) is a classroom-based, standards-referenced performance assessment for students in the primary grades organized around four purposes for language use: information and understanding, literary response and expression, critical analysis and evaluation, and social interaction. Studies were conducted to see how well the ELP meets these purposes. In 1997-98, 63 teachers representing 19 schools piloted the ELP with approximately 1,215 students in grades 1 to 3. The ELP was evaluated for construct validity, content validity, student performance, and  criterion validity. These evaluations found the ELP to be a valid assessment of literacy progress that is technically strong in that it effectively discriminates levels of student performance and can be scored reliably. Evaluations also found the ELP to be instructionally useful. One of the most powerful findings of the studies was the degree to which teachers reported the ELP to be supportive of their teaching and their students' learning.

Forty-five secondary schools representing three levels of grouping took part in the research. Within these schools, data have been collected from a cohort of Year 9 pupils, aged 13-14 years. All these pupils took tests in English, mathematics, and science as part of the national assessment. Test scores for these pupils at the end of Year 6 were collected retrospectively. Measures of self-concept, attitudes toward school and school work, social alienation, and truancy and exclusion from school were used to assess social and personal outcomes. The research also considers practices related to pupil grouping in school: (1) the allocation of pupils to groups; (2) the  mechanisms for movement between groups; (3) classroom practices; and (4) teacher attitudes. Responses of approximately 800 teachers show that the grouping structures adopted in a school are related to teacher attitudes toward different types of ability grouping. Teachers tended to view teaching mixed ability classes as more difficult. Preliminary findings from the analysis of pupil attainment suggest that ability grouping does influence achievement, but this influence is not uniform across subjects.

The goal of the New Standards Project is to develop explicit standards for student performance in every grade and subject that are comparable with the highest around the world. &quot;Confluent education&quot; may be conceived of as &quot;an engagement of students in spirited inquiry along paths continuously being mapped by scholars in each of the academic disciplines.&quot; The justified expansion of what counts as truth enriches confluent education. Appreciation of multicultural perspectives and advancement of  curricula that adapt content and objectives as well as methods of instruction and evaluation to meet the learning needs of diverse students is at the heart of such enrichment, and will ensure that the &quot;new standards&quot; for the 21st century are well-grounded and content sensitive.

Between 26 and 37 students responded to the assessments. Results from the first CAT validated as useful and effective the instructor's teaching approach through multiple methods to engage students in analyzing and reflecting about course readings. Taken together, responses to the three tests seem to identify a gap in assumptions about student learning strategies (at least for reading course texts) in which the instructor may assume that students engage the text with specific learning techniques, while the students are  not actually using these techniques and may be expecting the instructor to initiate or lead them through the learning process. Some implications for instruction are discussed. Five appendixes contain the CATs, results from these tests, a student statement about learning strategies, and some instructor-prepared questions.

Instructors in a teacher education setting describe their use of rubrics with preservice teachers in the expectation that these teacher candidates would eventually be using rubrics themselves and could benefit from their use as students. Instructors in the School of Education developed a scoring guide for sections of the same course, and others developed scoring guides for a class project, a review of articles on a subject, and a student-prepared lesson plan. The overall feeling of both faculty members and students is that scoring guides are a useful assessment tool that is helpful in teaching students about authentic assessment.  Students become more comfortable with scoring guides and teachers find that using rubrics improves teaching.

A public data base (the Longitudinal Study of American Youth was carefully chosen to facilitate verification of the empirical comparison between LS and LMS estimation. It is found that the LMS method results in a smaller average error of prediction and covers a larger proportion of variance in regression.

Students were asked to respond to a question about what the instructor did to reduce anxiety in the statistics class. The 86 responses could be classified into two groups: the teaching-related behaviors of the instructor; and the interpersonal style of the professor. Few responses related directly to strategies the instructor used to alleviate anxiety. In two focus groups of nine  students, responses mirrored the written responses. The conclusion drawn from these findings is that students perceive specific teaching behaviors and the interpersonal style of the instructor as being helpful in reducing anxiety. Effective teaching behaviors included giving individual help, expressing concern about anxiety, breaking the material down into small steps, using humor, and giving the students activities to help them grasp the concepts. Interpersonal factors include having a positive attitude and being encouraging, reassuring, supportive, and calm. (Contains 2 tables and 19 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The use of latent class modeling for investigating the measurement properties of a large-scale reading assessment database is demonstrated. The study focused on response data from the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, and Denmark, for a total sample of 15,304 nine-year-olds. One of the main research questions was whether the type of text (narrative, expository, and documents) elicits different types of reading comprehension. Findings indicate that there is no empirical evidence of three separate text types for any of the four countries, but there is empirical evidence of two separate reading domains. One latent  variable represents a general reading domain associated with all three text types, and the other represents a prose reading domain associated only with expository and narrative text types. The latent class modeling approach provides a way to examine the latent structure of the IEA reading test that avoids many problems that may occur when applying factor-analytic methodology.

Participants were 2,326 beginning teachers in Georgia in the 1998 fiscal year and their principals. Beginning teachers and their principals completed questionnaires that elicited, on a four-point scale, how well prepared and ready for the classroom the teacher was during the first 9 weeks on the job. The mean ratings for overall readiness and content knowledge were used in  the analyses. Beginning teachers were also classified as &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;not ready&quot; and &quot;knowledgeable&quot; or &quot;not knowledgeable&quot; by dichotomizing the rating scale. The analyses comprised one-sample and two-sample t-tests, binomial approximation to the normal distribution, and chi-squared tests of independence. Results provide favorable evidence of criterion-related validity for the two tests, but show no differences between the tests. Results also show that recommended cut-scores would have increased the number of false rejections rather than reducing the number of false acceptances. The results raise questions that require more in-depth examination. An appendix contains study data tables. (Contains 8 tables and 17 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The findings of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) are approached from the perspective of mathematics educators and education decision makers at state and local levels. Some key findings are highlighted to show problems and successes in mathematics teaching and learning, and some educational practices and policies that appear to improve student performance are identified. One half of the states improved student NAEP mathematics scores from 1990 to 1996. Students improved their performances in the algebra content areas and in geometry, and while they scored well on whole number computation and operations, they were weak in the area of number sense and estimation. Measurement is a particular  weakness in U.S. mathematics at all grade levels. Well-prepared teachers appear to make a difference in student achievement. The NAEP, TIMSS, and state assessment programs have important differences in their purposes, frameworks, types of items, and methods of reporting results. Based on the analyses of NAEP and TIMSS results, recommendations are offered for educators and decision makers. An appendix contains a map of some NAEP questions for grade 8.

The U.S. Department of Labor asked the National Research Council (NRC) to review the issues related to use of the GATB for screening all job applicants and providing employers with the job applicant's GATB scores. The NRC formed a committee to review the issue, but the committee did not include any industrial organizational psychologists who had studied the GATB. The Committee recommended against the use of the GATB for a number of reasons. These reasons are reviewed, and reasons the report development process and the report itself are  flawed are discussed. Criticism of the NRC process centers on the unusual composition of the review committee, the argument the committee made about the meager evidence of benefits from using the GATB, disagreement with the committee's conclusion about the &quot;zero-sum labor market,&quot; and some contradictory positions taken in the report. The NRC committee is charged with bias in its evaluation. (Contains 1 figure and 22 references.) (SLD)",

Targeting all 60 of the district's elementary schools, the project attempted to prepare more than 1,100 teachers to implement standards of excellence in the designated social sciences. In addition to preparing all the teachers to deliver a new curriculum based on national and Alaska standards, the project  provided a research-based experience to allow 128 teachers to transform their own approaches to teaching and learning and develop an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. The professional development component included graduate-level courses connected to the new curriculum. Overall, the project was successful in offering long-term, sustained professional development that supported high expectations for teachers and students.

The research project in question focuses on the effects of interest and importance on attention and learning of test material through a cognitive constructivist approach. Research has suggested that in texts on high interest topics, cognitive interest may play a stronger role than seductive details in creating interest and increasing the learning of important information. One possible way of using these findings in the classroom is to build curriculum around students' questions on topics that are of interest to them. Future research should value interest as an end in itself and not  simply as a means to increased learning. Future studies should also examine the relationships among interest and such constructs as motivation and engagement. (Contains 27 references.) (SLD)",

The instructional programs included drill and review. To determine self-efficacy and attitudes toward school, English, and mathematics, students completed the Student Opinion Survey (J. McMillan). Two other instruments were administered to provide evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. Findings suggest that the computer-based instruction increased student  interest in school and learning in general.

An item variant can be defined as an item with content based on an existing item to a greater or lesser degree. Item variants were first proposed as a way to enhance test security by increasing the size of CBT item pools. Variants are now also seen as useful rapid item-creation pools in programs that use paper-based testing exclusively because they also enhance security in that situation. This report summarizes the part played by variants in item pool expansion and item pool security, focusing on types of variants and their appropriate uses and the difficulties for item pool management created by item  variants.

In this research, student achievement was explored at the item, rather than test, level with the thought that differences might be found only at this micro level. It was hypothesized that middle school mathematics students whose teachers utilized a more student-centered, or constructivist, pedagogical approach would have a higher probability of obtaining the correct answer to mathematics items that measured conceptual, rather than procedural, understanding. This hypothesis was explicitly tested using  differential item functioning analyses. Results support the hypothesis, although not as strongly as had been expected.

This hypothesis was not supported. In addition, the results analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM) of this longitudinal correlation matrix reveal that the SEM model specified by the MSPAP six latent traits was unable to capture the underlying information of this data. Extra factors, such as  a general ability and an assessment method effect, may need to be considered for better fitting data. SEM was performed on the multitrait-multimethod correlation data, and the traits of Reading and Mathematics were assessed by MSPAP and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS).

NUDIST combines the accessibility to text of a word processing program with the data handling capacity of a database program, and some reporting features of a spreadsheet. The first study examined the beliefs of nine teacher education students. The second study examined the effects on middle school students (n=14) of Internet use when the technology was provided in the home.  The third study explored how 16 first-year undergraduates describe and think about their multiple social identities. The software influenced both the methodologies and analysis schemes used by the researchers. In these studies, the ability to give a concrete structure to large data sets, code at multiple levels, and pursue iterative analysis methods had many repercussions for the research effort.

Using the MTMM approach, the study focuses on the extent to which multiple methods of inquiry (surveys, drawings, and videos) are valid indicators of classroom teaching and learning experiences. Two broad classrooms traits were examined: the mode of instruction and the variety of learning materials used in the classroom. The samples consisted of 20 classrooms in grades 3 to 6 in 3 elementary school systems. Assessments included 30 to 45 minutes of video taping in the classroom during instruction, followed by closed-ended surveys and student drawings of teaching and learning. Constrained emergent coding was  used to score student drawings and classroom videos, with three raters for drawings and three raters for videos. Raters established a high degree of consistency in the coding. Findings indicate that student drawings and classroom videos demonstrate strong evidence of convergent and discriminant validity (construct validity) in assessing mode of instruction and variety of learning materials used in the classrooms. Surveys demonstrated strong evidence of discriminant validity, but revealed mixed results for convergent validity. Results provide new insights into the use of drawings and videos as assessment tools for the educational ecology of classrooms. The drawing and video scoring guides are attached.

        "description":"Structural knowledge is a pre-requisite to valid performance assessment scores because structural knowledge leads to better transfer. Better transfer will cause consistency to occur between task performances for a given individual, and this consistency allows for less construct-irrelevant variance and more construct-relevant variance to be present in the scores. This means more valid scores. This paper provides empirical support for each link in this argument. Concept maps are used as representations of the structural knowledge taught in a Political Science I course. Students in that course (approximately 325 students) were assessed using an essay performance assessment. Those students in the concept-mapping condition are shown to write more consistent essays than those who do  not use a concept map while writing. That is, the amount of task-related variance is related to the immediacy of having constructed a concept map. Structural knowledge is, therefore, a pre-requisite to valid performance assessment.

Because of the difficulty teachers had in interpreting the NHEIAP results, a custom-designed software program, the NHEIAP Data Interpreter, was developed to be a user-friendly, transparent means of examining district- or building-level groups of students. The NHEIAP Data Interpreter is a Windows program that displays the data for various groups in raw form or in frequency charts. The power of the program is in the subtlety with which it can select and compare groups of students, allowing educators to focus on the meaning of the data.

A multilevel analytical model was used in the longitudinal study that focused on 1,024 students in 21 rural and urban high schools. The study confirms, as other research in Australia has suggested, that most variation in student achievement appears to be at the classroom and student level, with negligible amounts at the school level, particularly when prior achievement and student background effects are included in the model. When the classroom effects were studied, student aggregates appeared to be stronger than teacher effects. This study suggests that it is  the classroom composite of peers that influences individual student achievement, rather than the particular teacher effects.

Swisher, 1987) for making educational decisions at the instructional program level for students with disabilities across groups of teachers who have various levels of familiarity with the PAES. The PAES is a functional vocational skills curriculum with an embedded assessment of vocational potential. Tasks included in the curriculum are representative of business, home economics, and industrial education, and they provide students with opportunities to complete projects that are simulations of entry-level job tasks. Educators familiar with the PAES completed a survey about its use. Of the responses, 104 were included in the sample, with only 102 included  in some analyses. Respondents generally perceived the PAES as more useful for making decisions related to transition planning; aptitude/achievement tests were considered more useful for making decisions associated with general education placements. Responses did not indicate significant differences between the two approaches for making statements about the present level of performance on the student's individualized education plan. Ultimately, the results suggest that students with disabilities are not served well by tests developed for their nondisabled peers. (Contains 7 tables and 33 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This study was designed to derive the distribution of a test statistic based on normal probability plots. The first purpose was to provide an empirical derivation of the critical values for the Line Test (LT) with an extensive computer simulation. The goal was to develop a test that is sensitive to a wide range of alternative distributions, applicable to a wide range of sample sizes, and easy to compute. The second purpose was to determine the power of LT and compare it to that of several other test statistics. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate the critical values of LT by randomly generating 500,000 replications from a normal distribution for sample sizes 10(1)100(25)1000(250)5000. For each replication, the value of LT was calculated. The empirical critical values were  determined for each of three levels of significance for each sample size. These critical values were then &quot;smoothed&quot; using nonlinear regression techniques. The results indicate that LT provides adequate control over Type I errors while at the same time providing statistical power comparable to the Shapiro-Wilk test. Results also indicate that LT is easy to compute, is powerful for detecting departures from normality under a wide variety of alternative distributions, and is available for sample sizes up to 5,000.

Sixteen other students collaborated without this support in a control condition. Students in both conditions had to work on complex cases in the domain of education. The use of the mapping tool had substantial effects on collaborative knowledge construction. Dyads in this group  produced more on-task contributions and used more theoretical concepts. Use of the mapping tool also facilitated transfer of prior knowledge, but no differences were found in the use of theoretical concepts provided in the learning environment.

Six Item Response Theory (IRT)-based domain score estimation methods were evaluated, under conditions of few items per content area per form taken, small domains, and small group sizes. The methods used item responses to a single form taken to estimate examinee or group ability; domain scores were then computed using the ability estimates and domain item characteristics. The IRT-based domain score estimates typically showed greater accuracy and greater consistency across forms taken than observed performance on the form taken. For the smallest group size and least number  of items taken, the accuracy of most IRT-based estimates was questionable; however, a procedure that operates on an estimated distribution of group ability showed promise under most conditions.

Treatment subjects periodically assessed their performance in terms of a written rubric that listed the criteria for each task and gradations of quality for each criterion. Students in the control group were not asked to assess their work. Think-aloud protocols were collected and coded to provide insight into spontaneous self-assessment, the classification of self-assessment, and the influence of self-assessment on metacognitive engagement and learning. Approximately three-quarters of the students assessed  themselves spontaneously. Girls in the treatment group were more metacognitive than boys, but no statistically significant differences were found for boys in treatment and control groups. Treatment students tended to outperform the control group on posttests. The rubric appeared to have a positive effect on the criteria that students used in their spontaneous self-assessments, and students who assessed their own work were remarkably willing to revise it.

The impact on total constructed response (c.r.) score, and subsequently on total test score, of assigning a single versus multiple raters to an examination reading of a student's set of c.r. responses was evaluated for several mixed-item format tests. Samples of approximately 2,000 students were obtained from a state mathematics field test at each of grades 5, 8, and 10 and from a reading field test at each of grades 4, 8, and 10. Item responses for c.r. items for each selected student in the six samples were allocated to raters three different ways: (1) single rater reading of all responses (SM1); (2) assignment of each c.r. response to a different rater (SM2); and (3)  splitting the c.r. items into thirds, with a different rater for each portion (SM3). SSM1 readings produced average total c.r. scores that were greater than the average total of c.r. scores produced in the SM2 condition. Average total c.r. scores when students' responses were allocated to three different raters (SM3) were similar to those of the SM2 condition. Results suggest that for tests with relatively large numbers of c.r. items, the use of as few as three raters to score a student's examination could produce scores that were similar in magnitude and scale to those obtained by assigning a different rater to each item.

        "description":"This paper focuses on methodological issues in applying equipercentile equating methods to pairs of tests that do not meet the assumptions of equating. This situation is referred to as a concordance situation, as opposed to an equating situation, and the end result is a concordance table that gives &quot;comparable&quot; scores between the tests. Interpretation of results is more ambiguous for a concordance situation than an equating situation, due to weaker assumptions, so that inappropriate use of results may be a problem. Examples are presented of specific issues that arose in applying equipercentile methods to create concordance tables between American College Test (ACT) composite and Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) verbal plus mathematics scores for both a large group of 14  institutions and 2 states and individual institutions within that pooled group. Issues include data collection and cleaning, applying the equipercentile method, choosing smoothing methods, computing concordance standard errors, and adjusting for sample size. The examples illustrate that it cannot be assumed that procedures that are appropriate for an equating situation are also appropriate for a concordance situation. Each pair of tests to be linked must be considered a unique situation. (Contains 5 tables, 9 figures, and 16 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The DIMTEST statistical procedure was used in a confirmatory manner to explore the dimensionality structures of three kinds of achievement tests: multiple-choice tests, constructed-response tests, and tests combining both formats. The DIMTEST procedure is based on estimating conditional covariances of the responses to the item pairs. The analysis was conducted on the results from the joint administration of the Constructed-Response Supplement to the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and Form M of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, using samples of 952 seventh graders and 882 eighth graders for the language tests, and 889 seventh graders and 918 eighth graders for the mathematics tests. Three potential sources of dimensional distinctness among items in the tests, caused by item format, item  content, and item location, were investigated. The results differed for language and mathematics achievement tests, in part because the tests were dissimilar with regard to content composition and the number of items in the whole tests as well as subtests that were analyzed. The Poly-DIMTEST analysis presented provides evidence of dimensional heterogeneity of tests intended to provide assessments that are balanced with respect to the content composition of a targeted construct. The analysis also suggests that combining items of different formats may introduce additional complexity into the dimensionality structure of the composite test.

Recommendations are made for legislative and administrative changes to improve research, development, and communication of research activities sponsored by the federal government. Two important trends provide the context for these recommendations. The first is the increasing number of students &quot;at risk&quot; in the school districts that are least able to marshal the resources to help them. The second is the accelerating growth of information technology. Two conclusions that emerge from educational research are that research has a proven record in educational improvement and  that federal support for education is an investment that must be expanded. Twenty-three specific recommendations are made to work toward the following goals: (1) priorities are set and activities are problem-centered; (2) high standards of quality are created and upheld; (3) work is collaborative and rigorous; and (4) the research mission is congruent with resources.

The learning community, the Student-Teacher-Parent Support (STPS) Unit, created guidelines to work collaboratively with students, parents, and counselors to insure the best possible climate for learning. The STPS Unit was found to be most effective in increasing the academic performance and academic involvement of academically unprepared students.

A number of studies have been conducted of the implementation and early outcomes of the initiative. Of particular interest are the following: (1) the Program on Education Policy and Governance Report, a survey of nearly 200 parents; (2) the American Federation of Teachers report, a study of the first year of implementation; (3) the Public Policy Forum report, an interview study of about 270 parents, teachers, and administrators; and (4) reports from Indiana University on various aspects of the program. In general, voucher participants do not seem to have demonstrated achievement gains (as a result of attending private school)  greater than their public school counterparts. Parent satisfaction and selection reasons tend to explain each other. Parents of public and private school students also tend to pay more attention to nonachievement factors in what they look for in a school. Overall, the voucher program does not seem to have clear impacts on academic achievement. (Contains 15 references.) (SLD)",

This model defines the structures of the school by its inputs, throughputs (or production process), and outputs. The production model produces quantitative reports describing the fiscal condition and the quality of output, thus creating a fiscal scorecard. Survey responses from 10,170 teachers from 331 Chicago schools were the data for an analysis using partial least squares path analysis (PLSPath). PLSPath indicates causal relationships between latent variables and reflects the relative strength of the latent constructs defined by its manifest variables. Analysis of survey responses indicates that teachers see themselves as the central characters within the school  and the sole determinant of the productive output. However, the races of the students, the organizational health of the school, and, on occasion, the external community determine the output. Data also suggest that the teachers view the principal as a deliverer of goods and services who maintains the teachers' commitment to productivity. Suggestions for further research include attention to the role of money in the model. (Contains 5 tables and 29 references.) (SLD)",

The first chapter gives background material about the assets and the young people surveyed. The second chapter gives in-depth information about each of the eight categories of assets, and chapter 3 examines the deficits and patterns of high-risk behavior that threaten to compromise healthy development. Chapter 4 builds links between the developmental assets and the risky behaviors and shows how assets promote eight indicators of  thriving. Chapter 5 pulls the pieces together to suggest an overall goal for well-being, and suggests that all elements of society share the blame and the responsibility for the problems faced by young people today. Documenting the realities of young people's lives makes it possible to build a firm foundation for their futures.

Findings from the review of research on parental and familial involvement point to the recurring theme that parental involvement is a necessity in education. Research has shown that schools that work well with families have improved teacher/staff morale and higher ratings of teachers by parents. The obvious general recommendation to be derived from this review is that schools should start a parental involvement program if one doesn't already exist. Another general recommendation is that the parental involvement programs need to meet the needs of all those involved, especially parents. Flexibility is the key to successful  parent participation programs.

The duties of local authorities under the Race Relations Act of 1976 are outlined. Suggestions are also made for things classroom teachers can do to promote racial equality in the whole school. In addition to their role in making whole-school policy, teachers can do much in specific subject areas to enhance equality for all students and combat racist behavior and assumptions.

Major findings are: (1) the share of spending on regular education is shrinking; (2) special education funding grew to 19.0% of all school spending; (3) school lunch and breakfast programs grew to 4.8% of total school spending in 1996; (4) bilingual education programs grew to 2.5% of total school spending in 1996; and (5) the shift of school spending away from the regular education program continues a trend observed over the period from 1967 to 1991. It would, however, be inaccurate to conclude that special education or other special programs have been growing at the expense of regular  education; such a conclusion would have to be based on speculation about what would have happened to regular education in the absence of the growth of special programs. This shift is a phenomenon worthy of policymakers' attention. The findings lend some support to the claims of those who deny that schools have wasted added funds received in the last 3 decades.

        "description":"Information from the National Survey on Gang Migration and other literature provides a look at the relationship between gang migration and proliferation. \"Gang migration\" refers to the movement of gang members from one city to another. Whether such movement has played a major role in the proliferation has been the focus of several studies, including the National Survey on Gang Migration conducted in 1992. Law enforcement personnel in approximately 1,100 cities answered questions about the movement of local gang members, and telephone interviews were conducted with law enforcement officers in 211 cities that reported the arrival of at least 10 migrant gang members in 1991. Findings from these studies and other data provide evidence that gang member migration, although widespread,  should not be viewed as the major culprit in the nationwide proliferation of gangs. Law enforcement officers usually do not see migrants as the cause of gang problems. Cities with gang problems should examine the dynamics of their own communities before attributing their gang problems to outside influences. (Contains 3 figures, 2 tables, and 33 references.) (SLD)",

The report is based on the best and most current national data available, using data from the Current Population Survey of the Bureau of the Census. Data show that about 5 out of every 100 young adults enrolled in high school in 1996 left school before October of 1997 without successfully completing a high school program. This estimate (the &quot;event&quot; dropout rate) of 4.6% was similar to those reported over the last 10 years, but lower than that of the early 1970s. Hispanic students were more likely than white and black students to leave school short of completing a high school program. In 1997, 9.5% of Hispanics were event dropouts, compared  with 3.6% of Whites and 5.0% of Blacks. Young adults from families with incomes in the lowest 20% of all family incomes were nearly seven times as likely to dropout as were their peers in the top 20% of income distribution. Status dropout rates represent the proportion of young adults aged 16 to 24 years who are out of school and have not earned a high school credential. In October 1997, 11% of the young adults in the United States were in this situation. Hispanic young adults have higher status dropout rates than either Whites or Blacks. In addition, data show that, in 1997, about 86% of all 18-through 24-year-olds not enrolled in school had completed high school or an equivalent credential.

The teacher of a combined second-third grade at an urban school characterized by a high degree of parent participation noted that one girl was having great academic difficulties. The child's family found nothing to appeal to them in the programs provided to involve parents, but were obviously committed and concerned parents, whose cultural backgrounds and own personalities made them willing to wait for their child to learn to read in the face of considerable pressure by the school system to enroll  their daughter in special education. Ways in which the teacher worked for the child's academic achievement while respecting the wishes of her parents to keep her in the neighborhood school illustrate the multiple points of entry a school or teacher can use to gain the confidence of parents in working together.

        "description":"In the 1990s, teen pregnancy and birth rates in the United States declined significantly. Researchers cite two main factors: fewer teens are having sex, and among those who are, more are using contraception. Despite these positive trends, there are still about one million pregnancies and about half a million births each year to young women aged 15 to 19. At best, the downward trend calls for cautious optimism. No one can predict whether rates will continue to decline, and it is a mistake to think that the problem of teen pregnancy is close to being solved. The consequences for young parents, particularly mothers and their children, are high, and diminished economic prospects are only part of the problem. First among strategies suggested to prevent teen pregnancy is providing  information about how to reduce risk-taking behaviors, such as unprotected sexual activity. A discussion of myths and facts about teen pregnancy is followed by a U.S. profile of teen pregnancy and profiles for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

A national search was conducted for representative family strengthening programs, and through a process that involved national conferences, regional training sessions, and technical assistance, 25 programs were selected as examples of family strengthening efforts. The programs fell into three broad types: behavioral parent training, family therapy interventions, and family skills training. The review of program activities suggests that there is no one best way to conduct a family intervention program, but some principles for program effectiveness were identified. These center on tailoring the program to the needs of people  served, with culturally aware and developmentally appropriate interventions. Research shows that family strengthening programs can curb crime and delinquency, and that to be maximally effective, delinquency prevention programs must start as early as possible.

Ten themes related to problematic issues, such as classroom teachers' apathy and disinterest during art lessons. A single theme highlighted the achievements and successes of preservice teachers as they recognizes the increased motivation and enthusiasm of disruptive or academically at-risk students when students became fully engaged in arts activities. Implications of the  inquiry underscore the importance of providing preservice teachers with hands-on encounters with the arts and the potential dangers of reducing or eliminating the arts in elementary education.

Analyses of their discussions reveals that exemplary teachers are passionate and committed to children's learning. They hold high expectations for all children's learning. Although sensitive about issues of linguistic diversity, the exemplary teachers believe all children must learn the dominant code. Unlike teachers in  other studies of exemplary urban faculty, the teachers in this study did not participate in community activities. Yet, they connected with children by constructing personal and caring places for learning, making learning exciting with varied activities, integrating cultural knowledge through literature, using humor, conducting field trips, and sometimes inviting children to their homes and communities.

The strategy of discursive analysis uses Michel Foucault's conceptualization of &quot;governmentality&quot; to examine discourses on the design and building of schools. The purpose is to question underlying assumptions about &quot;space&quot; and historical reasonings about a place called school. Particular historical junctures in discourses of school architecture provide the contingent conditions and reasonings on which the current debates about reform of school design seem reasonable and make sense. Schematically, they are: (1) the common school discourses of the &quot;school house&quot; during the 19th  century; (2) the emergence of the &quot;school-plant,&quot; which introduced city &quot;planning&quot; discourses into the discourses of school design during the 1920s and 1930s; (3) the &quot;open-plan&quot; in the 1950s that followed as a critique of the &quot;school-plant&quot;; and (4) the enfolding and redeployment of elements of the &quot;school-house,&quot;&quot;classroom school-plant,&quot; and the &quot;open plan&quot; in the &quot;school-as-community.&quot; (Contains 88 references and 14 endnotes.)

The Federal Even Start Family Literacy Program, authorized in 1988, is the catalyst for much of the family literacy activity nationally. Funded programs must adhere to Even Start's core organizational curriculum, and evaluation requirements and goals, but program models vary greatly and the degree to which programs reflect and involve the families they serve varies, although multisite programs tend to be more generic in organization and curriculum. Recruitment strategies that reflect cultural diversity and local norms, stress personnel contact, and use former program participants are most effective. Considering themselves partners in the  learning process both engages and empowers parents. Some curriculum components have been shown to increase family literacy program effectiveness with diverse learners. Especially effective are those that create opportunities for developing traditional literacy skills while showing participants that their native ways of communication are also valid literacy activities. Developing parental skills is the goal of all family literacy programs, and those that build on participants' strengths also build participants' self-esteem. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)",

Fifty-two pairs of immigrant Korean American mothers and their children, aged 15 to 18, were interviewed. Twenty-six of the adolescents had been born in Korea and 26 were born in the United States. The intensity of mother-child conflict was significantly related to family bonding as measured by responses to a family bonding scale. The level of acculturation was significantly related to cultural identity, but the relationships among the other variables were not statistically  significant. Findings suggest that the frequency of conflict is not related to family bonding, but the intensity of the conflict may be. Findings further suggest that mother-child conflict is not necessarily related to the child's acculturation level or cultural identity, although continued conflict may weaken family bonding. (SLD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this ex post facto study was to explore the interactive relationship among grade level of transition to high school, gender, and grade level of dropping out of high school as factors associated with high school dropout rates. Fifteen schools at each of the most common high school grade spans were studied, for a total of 45 schools. The findings imply that as the grade level of transition to high school is raised, high school dropout rates increase. Boys have larger high school dropout rates than girls. It appears that as the grade level of transition to high school is raised, the difference between dropout rates for boys and girls increases. The highest dropout rates occur at 11th grade. The dropout rates are particularly large for grade 10-12 high schools with the  transition to high school at 10th grade. The dropout rates were lowest for both boys and girls in high schools with grade spans from 7 through 12 in which the transition to high school occurred at seventh grade.

        "description":"In 1997, the Detroit Public Schools Board of Education established an agreement with Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc. to enable Sylvan to provide supplementary reading instruction to selected students in 10 elementary, middle, and high schools. An evaluation was conducted to determine the extent to which Sylvan met its goals. Data indicate that Sylvan did not meet its first goal of providing at least 55 hours of instruction to 1,458 students, and it was not effective in accomplishing its second goal of increasing school MEAP and MAT7 scores. When Sylvan schools were compared with control schools, there were no significant differences in grade 4 and grade 7 reading MEAP scores. Teachers (n=106) had mixed reactions to the Sylvan program, but parents liked the program, and principals  (n=10) expressed an interest in continuing Sylvan services in their buildings. It was recommended that Sylvan services be continued, with the program adjusted to pay for the number of hours that actually could be used. Improved cooperation between classroom teachers and Sylvan staff was also recommended. Five appendixes contain MEAP and MAT7 data and the parent, teacher, and principals surveys.

        "description":"The Powerful Learning Framework was developed by the Accelerated Schools Project in 1997. The framework is an approach that integrates curriculum, instruction, and context through five components. Powerful learning is described as authentic, interactive, learner-centered, inclusive, and continuous. This study was conducted to identify additional descriptors for the components of the Powerful Learning Framework so that the framework can be applied to teachers' learning. The responses of seven teachers to the concepts of powerful learning are used to derive characteristics of powerful learning for teachers related to the initial concepts of the model. For teachers, powerful learning contains these characteristics: (1) teachers can relate what they are experiencing to real issues  and situations (authentic); (2) teachers interact collaboratively (interactive); (3) teachers become enabled to take charge of their own learning (learner-centered); (4) all teachers have equal access to learning opportunities (inclusive); and (5) teachers reflect on their learning experiences to make connections with previous learning (continuous). Results from the interviews with teachers show that the Powerful Learning Framework can be used to identify the powerful learning experiences of teachers. (Contains 13 references.) (SLD)",

This report describes the characteristics of the programs, their mentors, and the youth they serve, and presents a classification of mentoring programs based on the data collected. The 722 programs responding to the survey were serving about 115,000 youth aged 5 to 18. Nearly 40% of the programs were less than 5 years old, and newer programs tended to be smaller than those established earlier. Programs tended to have multiple goals for mentoring relationships, but long-established programs were more likely to report personal development or relationship formation as the most important goal for mentoring matches, while newer programs were more likely to report academic or  career-related goals as most important for their matches. The developed classification first separates group from one-on-one programs and then divides site-based and community-based programs according to their long-term and short-term emphases and the amount of infrastructure the program contains. Two appendixes discusses study methodology and describe the National Mentoring Partnership's Public Policy Council. (Contains 12 tables, 10 figures, and 7 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"A project developed a resource to inform and support the information and communications technology (ICT) training process. Its target audience were directors of small and medium-sized enterprises and those responsible for developing ICT use within a company or for managing staff training. The project gathered information from previous experience, a literature review, and reports; developed the resource on CD-ROM and produced a version to pilot; and piloted with business users and evaluated outcomes. The resource was organized into 10 interrelated sections. Each section was introduced by an audio commentary and had subsections consisting of one or more text screens. The sections were introduction, planning, evaluation, modes of delivery, six case studies, summary, needs analysis,  change in practice, glossary, and references. Data for evaluation of the pilot CD-ROM were completed questionnaires from 19 business users. Eighteen described their use of ICT in a personal context as being well developed or reasonable; four users described their business use as well developed. Views were mixed regarding navigation around the resource. No consensus was reached as to which aspect was most worthwhile. All saw modes of delivery as interesting and useful. Issues arising from development and use of the resource related to the value of case studies; transferability of good practice; and teamwork. Recommendations were made for enhanced interactivity and further development of sections the business community saw as particularly useful. (Contains 26 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"The impact of labor hire companies (employment agencies) on Australia's apprenticeship system was studied. Three data collection strategies were used: literature review; survey of a random sample of 200 labor hire firms in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia; and case studies of four recruitment and labor hire firms and their client firms. Of the 57 (29%) firms that responded to the survey, 43 returned usable questionnaires. It was discovered that, like the firms they serve, labor hire firms may be small, medium, or large. Labor hire firms operate in all of Australia's states and industries but focus on main population and employment centers. Labor hire firms have a relatively young work force, primarily offer short-term replacement/supplementation  services, rely on client relationships and repeat business, and have skilled and experienced work forces drawn from the available skill pool and the labor force. It was concluded that, although labor hire has not caused Australia's decline in apprenticeships, it may have contributed to the deferral of consideration of longer-term skill requirements. (Twenty-seven figures/tables are included. Appendixes constituting approximately 60% of this document contain the following: 45 references; 4 case studies; and the survey questionnaire and a summary of responses.) (MN)",

Section 1 examines the problems of helping the following groups: marginalized individuals in need of vocational or social (re)integration; individuals in the process of becoming marginalized, individuals who appear to be &quot;problem free&quot;; and groups adversely affected by the economic recession. The case study findings pertinent to the issue of facilitating adults' social, personal, and/or occupational transitions are detailed in section 2. Special attention is paid to facilitating vocational integration, encouraging self-esteem and determination, teaching adults to network, helping adults make the best use of what they have learned, and helping adults reacquire a  social role and reintegrate into temporary or permanent settings. Section 3 presents the following institutional solutions to the problems of personalizing help, advice, and guidance and offering guidance for the medium- or long-term future: improving services at the individual level, preventing marginalization, developing policies at the European and national levels, adopting a multidisciplinary and holistic approach, and linking passive and active measures. Appended is information about quantitative and qualitative methods of evaluating counseling services and evaluation for cost-benefit analyses and services adapted to needs.

        "description":"This longitudinal study analyzed planning processes in teachers' collaborative curriculum-making, working with two teacher teams in a Finnish elementary school and one American team. Data from discourses, interviews, and observations addressed: differences and similarities in the planning processes involved in curriculum making; changes in the contents of planning discourse as the organization of teachers' collaboration changed; collaborative learning of teacher teams; and preconditions for the teams to make network contacts. This paper discusses the following topics: a comparative analysis of planning trajectories in Finnish and American teacher teams; social languages and change in the organization of teachers' collaboration; object formation and turning points (collaborative  learning in teacher teams); and teams as network builders (analyzing the use of network contacts). The study showed that talk is the most fluid instrument of collaboration, and, thus, particularly sensitive to change in the organization. Two appendixes present data on the frequency of types of turn-taking in Finnish and American teacher teams and relative frequencies of moods of the Finnish and American teacher team discourse.

        "author":["Whitman, Nancy C."],
        "description":"This paper discusses practices, issues, and trends in Japanese middle school education that have bearing on U.S. education, grouping them into four categories. Section 1, &quot;School Reform,&quot; discusses central control of education, opportunities for student creativity, improved teacher education, and the examination system. Section 2, &quot;Centralization,&quot; observes Japan's move toward decentralization while the United States concurrently moves away from decentralization. Section 3, &quot;School Organization and the Use of Time,&quot; describes middle school grade levels, block scheduling, the school year, team teaching, teacher collaboration, looping, and student uniforms. Section 4, &quot;Curriculum,&quot; discusses how the Japanese school curricula differs from U.S. curricula. Some of the differences are  that in Japan, the academic curriculum is determined by the Ministry of Japan, while in the U.S., it is determined by local boards of education. In Japan, unlike the U.S., there are academic requirements for music, art, and moral education. Japan has less focus on teamwork and cooperative learning. In recent years, both countries have increased technology use in the schools. Section 5, &quot;Equity Issues,&quot; explains that educational equity has different meanings in the two countries. In the U.S., the concept of individualism ties in with the concept of equal educational opportunity, with students grouped by their ability and taught curricula in keeping with an individual student's development. Equal opportunity in Japan means providing each student with the same contents to learn, equal  financial support, and equal physical facilities. (SM)",

Participants included experts from 30 universities, authors of commissioned papers, teachers from local schools, representatives from educational and professional organizations, community partners, and U.S. Department of Education representatives. This publication summarizes events from each of the two days, focusing on five questions that were addressed: What would a program preparing teachers to employ contextual teaching and learning strategies look like? How  can preservice programs utilize interaction between campus and K-12 schools to promote contextualized teaching and learning? How can preservice programs utilize the community to promote contextual teaching and learning? How can preservice programs utilize the workplace to promote contextual teaching and learning? and How can the various dimensions already discussed be utilized to promote diversity?

        "description":"In 1998, the Board of Directors for the Washington State Institute for Public Policy directed staff to study teacher quality. The Institute examined three teacher preparation and development programs covering the early stages of teachers' careers: pre-service teacher preparation, beginning teacher assistance, and professional certification. Researchers obtained information on the three programs from case studies, surveys, and interviews. All new teachers hired by public schools from 1996-1998, plus all public school principals, received mailed surveys. Researchers reviewed the history of teacher preparation and development in Washington and research literature on teacher quality, analyzed data on certification and teacher employment in Washington, and summarized activities  related to teacher quality in other states. The study found that reliance on statewide standards, statewide performance assessments, and clear accountability for assuring teacher quality varied by the stage of teacher preparation and development. There were no consistent statewide standards for what teachers should know and be able to do that addressed each stage of a teacher's career. No statewide assessments measured the knowledge, skills, and performance of preservice, beginning, or professional teachers. Accountability for ensuring teacher quality was largely a local rather than state responsibility. The 19 appendixes provide data on standards, policy, assessment, certification, and responsibility. The report also contains an extensive bibliography. (SM)",

To determine the influence of advertising, teachers have high school students discuss what their latest health product/service purchase was, why they bought it, and whether advertising had any effect on their spending. The instructor creates an advertising slogan quiz and tests students on their knowledge. In pairs, students create a quiz that contains two slogans for oral presentation. The class attempts to answer with the correct product/service. Students observe one advertisement in the mass or print media that has an influential slogan, then the teacher presents it as an oral quiz during  the next class as a review. To evaluate a product's health claims, middle school students discuss whether they have ever purchased health products that did not perform as their claim stated. They learn about five questions to ask when evaluating a product's health claims and how to correctly distinguish between valid and invalid health information using those questions. The teacher selects a health product advertisement from a magazine that makes questionable health claims to provide an example for students to follow. Students then complete a questions to ask sheet as pertaining to the advertisement. (SM)",

Data come from three large national probability samples of teachers taken over 7 years. The main sources were the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and the Public and Private School Teacher Questionnaires of the Schools and Staffing Surveys. This report presents the resulting data about the yield of degree graduates in a series of 22 tables. The focus is on one source of supply of teachers: degree graduates from teacher preparation programs. The report presents the summary results in terms of: trends in the yield of degree  graduates, yield of entering teachers produced by degree graduates, yield of degree graduates as a function of certification status, yield of degree graduates as a function of out-of-field teaching, and trends in the surplus or shortage of degree graduates. Overall, the production of graduates from teacher preparation programs has been sufficient to meet demand, but there are some continuing shortages in certain areas.

The first section consists of graduate-level dissertations and theses of teacher researchers who have created their own professional development models and educational theories and shown how they can contribute to the reconstruction of educational knowledge and theory. The next section consists of an analysis of the author's educative influence with several professional educators in the educative process of their self-generation in their life within education. The paper concludes that educational researchers can create educational  knowledge in their self-studies of their own practice, and they can make useful contributions to educational theory through their work in the traditional disciplines of philosophy, psychology, sociology, history, economics, politics, and management of education.

        "description":"This publication describes a model for faculty development in the area of immigrant Latino students. The Bridging Cultures Project was developed to address: how teacher professional development would affect teachers' understanding of how differing values could lead to conflict between home and school; how teachers could translate such understanding into improved practices bridging home and school cultures; and what effects this faculty development would have on students, teachers, and parents. The project was designed to validate a professional development process and materials for use with other teachers. This publication also describes the second phase of the project, which focused on: documenting the teachers' changes in thinking and practice; continuing to support teachers'  growth as a professional development cadre; and disseminating the project through presentations/professional development workshops and publications. The four appendixes offer the Bridging Cultures Pre-assessment, Bridging Cultures Participant Questionnaire, Bridging Cultures Post-assessment, and Teacher Exit Questionnaire.

The research focused on whether district size, ethnic student makeup, or district property wealth would make a difference in a school district's ability to recruit and retain quality teachers. A two-part questionnaire was mailed to all Texas school districts, and 325 out of 1,078 responded. The questionnaire asked for quantitative data about types of vacancies, percentage of students in various academic programs, starting salaries, extra pay for types of degrees and certification, local incentives and benefits for teachers, strategies for filling vacancies, and conditions under which non-certified teachers were hired. It also asked for qualitative data about the  impact of teacher shortage; retaining, recruiting, and mentoring; and strategies the state should implement to guarantee an adequate supply of teachers. Researchers grouped the districts by student population numbers and divided them into categories of wealth and categories of ethnicity (predominantly Hispanic or predominantly white). Results indicated that ethnicity made a significant difference in the number of teaching vacancies. Size also made a significant difference, but wealth had no effect on the number of vacancies school districts reported. (Contains 10 references.) (SM)",

This article describes several types of DRIFT (primacy/recency, differential centrality/extremism, and practice/fatigue) and Rasch measurement procedures designed to identify these types of DRIFT in rating data. These procedures are applied to simulated data and are shown to be useful in classifying raters as being aberrant or nonaberrant about 95% of the time for primacy, recency, and differential centrality and extremism, particularly for moderate or larger effect sizes. Rates of correct classification for practice and fatigue were lower (about 89%) and statistical power exceeded 0.50 only with very  large effect sizes.

        "description":"This second annual report on public K-12 education in Rhode Island focuses on fourth graders, an age group that represents the most vulnerable portion of the school population. As the percentage of proficient fourth graders increases, the secondary schools will find it easier to raise their levels of proficiency. Rhode Island administers a School Accountability for Learning and Teaching (SALT) Survey to yield information about the key dimensions of school functioning. The SALT Survey consists of versions for elementary, middle, and high schools with different forms for parents, teachers, students, and administrators. This report presents information from the SALT survey and some additional sources to paint a portrait of what education actually looks like in Rhode Island's  schools. Data are grouped into discussions of: responsive schools; student assessment; community support networks; and well-prepared, well-supported teachers. An analysis of information about Rhode Island schools suggests that three things are necessary to achieve 100% proficiency for all fourth graders: (1) taking care of the multiple needs that influence children's ability to perform in school; (2) giving teachers and students the opportunities they need to teach and learn commensurate with established standards; and (3) focusing first and foremost on reading.

The most popular measure of types has been the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (K. Briggs and I. Myers). This measure has been criticized for dichotomous scoring, forced-choice response formats, and differential gender weighting of item responses. Two studies, one involving 207 college students and the other involving 894 college students, were conducted to explore the psychometric properties of scores from an alternative measure of types, the Personal Preferences Self-Description Questionnaire (PPSDQ) (B. Thompson, 1996). Results are compared with those from related previous studies involving the Myers and Briggs measure or the PPSDQ. Results regarding  the psychometric properties of PPSDQ scores were very encouraging and were consistent with previous results for the same measure. They were as good as, or superior to, results reported for the Myers and Briggs measure. Appendixes contain item analysis statistics for the PPSDQ, a table of gender differences on PPSDQ scales, a variance/covariance matrix for one of the studies, and varimax-rotated component function/structure coefficients for one study.

Forms of the PPSDQ and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (I. Myers and M. McCaulley, 1985) were completed by 394 college students. A variety of first- and second-order factor structure models, as well as concurrent validity models, were evaluated using structural equation modeling (SEM). In addition, factor invariance across gender was also evaluated using SEM. The PPSDQ was found to measure four underlying constructs adequately, as hypothesized. Evidence  was also found for a higher-order factor underlying these four dimensions. No gender modeling effects were found in this data set.

The report is based on a survey of two statewide samples of elementary schools at which students had taken the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) fourth-grade test in 1997 and 1998. The first was a sample of 30 schools at which scores had improved significantly (a rate of 50% or better). The second was a group of 10 schools that served a similar population but which had experienced little, if any, improvement. The researchers interviewed each principal and collected written materials about the school's improvement strategy. Among the key conclusions is that effective changes in teaching methods and materials should be focused and schoolwide,  not random and fragmented. Schools that were improving operated as teams, not loose associations. They were marked by professional development and were active in seeking help. Improving schools used their limited resources strategically and called on parents to help. Performance pressure was found to be helpful when it fosters determination and not fear. The study shows that schools can boost student achievement with concerted effort. Specific recommendations are made for policymakers, educators, parents, and community and business leaders. (SLD)",

Collecting data by the functional categories defined by the National Center for Education Statistics was the challenge that was most clearly met by the developed  instrument. The instrument also shows that it is possible to collect school-level data, but the drawback is that the instrument must be fairly complex and thus creates a burden for the respondent. One appendix contains the instrument, and the other explains common errors that cause data inconsistency. (SLD)",

In each of those school years, the Census Bureau also conducted a reinterview of the administrators, schools, and teachers. This report contains the reinterview results from the 1993-94 school year. The reinterviews evaluated a subset of survey questions for response variance. Thirty-nine percent of the questions evaluated in the Teacher Survey displayed high response variance, but most questions evaluated from the school survey displayed low response variance. Almost half of the questions evaluated in the reinterview for the administrator survey displayed high response  variance. Only a handful of questions from the surveys have been evaluated through reinterview, and the NCES and the Census could achieve more benefits from the reinterview program if the reinterview evaluation and survey improvement efforts were more closely linked. Suggestions are made to accomplish this linkage. An attachment contains the response variance formula. (SLD)",

The first paper documents some of the problems that were encountered during student sample selection and the methods used to resolve those problems. It also provides some suggestions to alleviate some of the problems in future SASS studies. Significant problems were: (1) missing sampling data; (2) schools that would not cooperate; (3) problems with the instructions; (4) duplicate students; (5) timing problems; (6) matching problems; (7) omitted numbers of classes students took; and (8) teachers incorrectly identified as ineligible. The second paper explores options for using information from the Private School Survey (PSS) to ratio adjust the SASS to achieve agreement between the two  surveys. Two broad classes of solutions are discussed. The first involved extrapolation from previous enumerations of the PSS to produce estimates, and the second involved interpolation between the 1997-98 PSS and preliminary information for the 1999-2000 PSS.

The framework focuses on school reform and the information SASS can collect to inform the United States about school reform efforts. Major reform agenda and expert opinion are reviewed, and the issues and topics common to them are identified. These topics are classified under the two major objects of school reform: teacher capacity and school capacity. Teacher capacity is defined in terms of teacher quality, career paths, professional development, and instructional practice. School capacity is defined in terms of school organization and management, decision-making authority, curriculum and instruction, parental involvement, school  safety and discipline, and school resources. Part I presents background information about the SASS and its redesign. Part 2 describes the sources of input reviewed for the redesign, and part 3 synthesizes the input around the common issues or topics. Part 4 recommends the organization of these topics under the two major reform headings, and part 5 discusses several issues of survey design and methodology.

        "description":"In large multipurpose surveys, it is common to select the sample systematically proportional to some measure of size (PPS) that is correlated with an important variable of interest. Assuming the frame is sorted in a useful deterministic manner, systematic sample methodologies provide an additional control on the sample allocation, beyond the control provided from the stratification. This makes it less likely to select a &quot;bad sample.&quot; This should reduce the variability of the estimates as compared to a comparable nonsystematic selection procedure. The problem with systematic samples is that variance estimators are biased. This paper presents a bootstrap variance estimator, which can have less bias than standard methodologies, such as half-sample replication. The results will be  demonstrated with a simulation study based on an important National Center for Education Statistics survey, the Schools and Staffing Survey. An appendix demonstrates the consistency of the proposed estimators. (Contains 8 tables and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The Census Bureau conducted the TFS in 1988-89, 1991-92, and 1994-95. During each of these surveys, the Census Bureau reinterviewed a subsample of the respondent teachers. In 1994-95, the reinterviews focused on current teachers who had remained in teaching after participating in the SASS. The TFS reinterview measured response variance in a subset of questions from the survey. Seventy-eight percent of the questions evaluated displayed high response variance, and only 5% displayed low  response variance. The most problematic questions involved allocation of teacher time. Recommendations for survey improvement center on redesign of the questions about teachers' main activity and the substitution of &quot;yes/no&quot; questions for &quot;mark all that apply.&quot; Five attachments contain recommendations, response variance formulas and measures tables, a conversion table, and the reinterview questionnaire.

This study focuses on variance estimation and its consequences for analysis of survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Methods suggested by C. Sarndal (1992), S. Kaufman (1996), and S. Shao and R. Sitter (1996) are reviewed in detail. In section 3, the bootstrap method of Shao and Sitter is applied to the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 1993-94 Public School Teacher Survey component to assess the magnitude of imputation variance. This method is appealing, but requires repeated imputations, so for large scale surveys, the data files become too large. The empirical study shows, however, that using the hot deck imputation method in the 1993-94 SASS can affect the standard error seriously.  However, the majority of items have very low stage 2 (hot deck) imputation rates. When the imputation rate is low, the inflation in variance is not severe. It appears feasible for NCES to compute imputation rates and document the problem with the next user's manual. (Contains 8 tables and 11 references.) (SLD)",

The initial objective was to see if it was technically possible to analyze overlap samples of schools from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) to produce substantive findings. Over the course of the project various other objectives were added, including an appraisal of longitudinal designs for a general study of schools and recommendations about the use of the SASS. This report contains a discussion and set of recommendations about the use of longitudinal designs for National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) data collections and reporting on schools. It is recommended that the NCES not invest in a more elaborate panel design for the study of  schools because the payoff would not be great enough. The second section of the report is a description of the initial feasibility study of the use of the SASS overlap study. The study finds that it is feasible to use these data to enhance the repeated cross-sectional SASS with additional time-related information. Three appendixes contain comparisons of items on the SASS school administrator and school questionnaires and thoughts on a longitudinal survey of schools and educational reform.

This paper is one of several that have been prepared in support of ECLS-B design efforts. It is anticipated that three waves of data will be collected from families of children born between January and December 2000, with supplementary data collected from child care providers. Several options remaining to be decided are addressed, including identifying the primary respondent and other respondents, the assessments to be used, and how to collect data on variables such as other children in the family. The following eight major domains have been  identified for the study: (1) demographic background; (2) family organization, composition, history, and turbulence; (3) family processes; (4) child care; (5) child characteristics; (6) child outcomes; (7) early health care, feeding patterns, nutrition, and insurance; and (8) distal constructs, such as neighborhood characteristics. Each of these domains is discussed. (Contains 485 references.) (SLD)",

The proposal under consideration, which is being field tested in the fall of 1998 and winter of 1999, has two major components. The first is to collect more detailed information about staffing resources in the schools included in the SASS sample. This information would improve understanding of how schools allocate personnel resources, which account for more than 85% of expenditures at most school sites. A review of the options suggests that the data needed to conduct Resource Cost Model analyses of U.S. schools can be collected through the SASS without much increase in  the burden on respondents. The second component is to gather expenditure data for individual schools in the SASS sample to permit analysis of expenditures at the school level. The analysis shows that it is possible to collect information by NCES function and object categories and to collect school-level data across a diverse array of districts. A drawback is that an instrument of the complexity needed to meet these two purposes is difficult and time consuming for the respondent. The final section of the paper discusses linking the staffing and expenditure data. Appendixes contain information about the development of the surveys and copies of the public school and private school surveys. (Contains 19 exhibits.) (SLD)",

The algorithm can be used to equate number-correct scores across different administrations of the same adaptive test as well as to an external reference test. The constraints are derived from a set of conditions on item response functions that guarantees the observed number-correct score distributions on two forms to be identical (W. van der Linden and R. Luecht, 1998). An item pool from the Law School Admission Test is used to compare the results of the algorithm with those for traditional observed-score equating of ability estimates to number-correct scores as well as the transformation to predicted number-correct scores through the  test characteristic function. The effects of the constraints on the statistical properties of the ability estimator are examined. (Contains 18 references, 4 figures, and a list of University of Twente research reports.)

        "description":"A method of item pool design is proposed that uses an optimal blueprint for the item pool calculated from the test specifications. The blueprint is a document that specifies the attributes that the items in the computerized adaptive test (CAT) pool should have. The blueprint can be a starting point for the item writing process, and it can be used to assemble item pools in a system of rotating pools from a master pool. The blueprint is also useful for item pool maintenance. Designing the blueprint begins with analyzing the specifications for the CAT, a step amounting to the formation of a classification table involving categorization of quantitative item attributes. Using this table, an integer programming model for the assembly of the shadow tests in the CAT simulation is  constructed. An estimate of the ability distribution of the identified population of examinees is obtained, and the CAT simulation is carried out using the integer programming model for the shadow tests and sampling simulees from the ability distribution. The blueprint is then calculated from the counts of the number of items from the cells in the classification table. The best way to implement the blueprint is in a sequential fashion recalculating the blueprint after a certain portion of the items has actually been written and tested so that their attribute values are known.

        "description":"A model of assisting students in the transition to university education is presented that takes a developmental approach. This Integrated Development of English Language and Academic Literacy and Learning (IDEALL) model recognizes that all students need to develop new or more sophisticated academic skills for the new environment and that the most effective way of assisting students is to integrate instruction in both generic and discipline-specific academic skills inside the curriculum. The model revolves around collaboration between discipline and learning developmental academics in the production of learning materials tailored to the needs of the curriculum and the provision of subject-based workshops that are team taught by staff from the discipline and the learning  development unit. Data from two case studies of the IDEALL approach are presented. One case describes the use of the IDEALL approach in an Introduction to Management course, and the other describes the approach taken with approximately 350 students in an introductory biology course. Data from these studies suggest that the model can increase the learning outcomes achieved by students substantially. (Contains 8 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The quality and the effectiveness of the 1992 New Jersey Grade 8 Early Warning Test (NJEWT) are assessed. Standardized tests possess clear advantages for educators, especially in the case of administration and scoring, but there are clear disadvantages as well, including the possibility of bias. Four criteria are applied to the NJEWT: adequacy, impact, reliability, and validity. The writing test of the NJEWT appears to test reading comprehension more than writing, making the validity of information collected highly suspect. The quality of information provided by the reading test is also questionable, and the essays in this section are not well suited to the task of assessing student reading ability. The mathematics section also suffers some serious shortcomings. It uses word  problems and requires students to explain in writing the reasoning they used to arrive at their answers, making it as much a test of language facility as of mathematics. Global deficiencies of the NJEWT include: (1) confusing structure; (2) confusing directions; and (3) confusing use of capital letters in the test items. The 1992 NJEWT has only limited value as an assessment tool. It is not possible to evaluate the reliability of the test in the absence of data from various test administrations across sample groups.

In 1982, a Consent Decree was established to meet the goals of desegregation of San Francisco's schools. Under the Consent Decree, the school district receives state money to implement programs for targeted students. An evaluation model was developed to assess these programs. The model focuses on: (1) project description; (2) professional development; (3) qualitative evaluation; (4) quantitative evaluation; and (5) budget considerations. The model can be used with a range of  programs while still providing specific information about key areas of concern to school district administrators and the Board of Education. Participatory evaluation is a feature of the model, and outcome evaluation is an essential aspect. The experiences of the San Francisco school district with this approach have shown that it is possible to develop and implement an evaluation approach that can be used for many projects.

Each local school district determines the methods of assessing students' progress in reading in these grades. The second component, the New Mexico Achievement Assessment Program, is administered to all students in grades 3 through 9 in the content areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. The norm-referenced test used for this purpose is the CTBS5/TerraNova  Survey Plus with a custom supplement test booklet for New Mexico. Together, these tests provide performance-level data about student progress toward the state's standards. The New Mexico Writing Assessment Program is a direct, on-demand assessment for student in grades 4 and 6. Districts have the option of using a version of this assessment for grade 8. The New Mexico High School Competency Examination is a criterion-referenced test. Passing this examination is a requirement for public high school students in New Mexico. Some information is also provided about exemptions from the testing program, test security, and using test results. (SLD)",

More than 25% of the students at each school are limited English proficient (LEP). Two-way instruction is provided in English and Spanish throughout the duration of this Dual Language Project (DLP). Evaluation data were collected from many sources, including test results from the Language Assessment Scales. Evaluation findings show that the DLP uses a variety of strategies effectively to promote an environment at each school that reflects the goals of bilingualism,  multiculturalism, and biliteracy. Cultural emphasis is being promoted through parent participation programs and parent education. During the 1997-1998 school year, the DLP served 1,116 students, including 342 LEP students. The DLP also provided 18 staff development sessions for teachers and administrators. Analysis of test results shows only slight gains by many DLP students in oral Spanish proficiency, raising questions about the extent of Spanish language instruction. Among program recommendations is a review of Spanish language instruction. Additional resources and additional professional development are recommended for program continuation. Appendixes contain a timeline for staff development, a description of activities related to technology supporting the DLP, and a summary of  conference participation by DLP staff.

In fact, the requirement for capacity is present at all levels of the system in systemic reform. In educational change, four types of capacity are generally considered: (1) human capacity; (2) organizational capacity; (3) structural capacity; and (4) material capacity. Because there are so many types of capacity, evaluators may find a general organizing structure for looking at capacity useful before they set out to identify specific questions and indicators for evaluating capacity. A matrix is provided to allow evaluators to focus on the different types of capacity as &quot;drivers&quot; of targeted studies designed to match the more  immediate strategies and goals of the reform. Examining capacity is one of the ways educational evaluators and researchers can examine reform efforts more thoroughly. (Contains 8 references.)(SLD)",

The CoPER now includes 13 school districts and 6 institutions of higher education collectively engaged in work in more than 50 partner schools and other initiatives. Several perspectives were considered in order to evaluate CoPER operations and initiatives. The purpose and structure of the partnership created a significant challenge regarding an appropriate theoretical grounding to drive the research methodology. Eventually, an interactive and responsive evaluation approach was developed. Each school kept an activity log, and each site arranged for focus groups of its key stakeholders.  Surveys were designed for faculty and students, and some classroom observations were carried out. The evaluation of CoPER, a state level umbrella organization, collected data germane to specific partner sites. The evaluation results were portraits of specific sites, but many common experiences or data trends could be extrapolated across sites and institutions. Much of the information discovered reflected the importance of relationships and the role of personalities. Results emphasize the individual differences and similarities of partnership members.

In addition, the report includes projections of enrollment in public elementary and secondary schools and high school graduates to the year 2009 at the state level. These projections reflect revisions influenced by the 1990 Census, the 1997 estimates, and the latest assumptions for fertility rate, net immigration, and mortality rate. A methodology section describes models and assumptions used to develop the projections, which are based on a cohort survival model, an age-specific enrollment rate model, exponential smoothing models, and econometric  models. Most of the projections include three alternatives, based on different assumptions about growth paths. The first alternative, the middle projection, is considered the most likely. In the forecast summary, key demographic and economic assumptions are presented in chart 1 and selected education statistics are shown in figure 1. Total public and private elementary and secondary enrollment is projected to increase to 54.5 million in 2006 and remain constant through the year 2009. Higher education enrollment, however, is projected to increase by 14%, to 16.3 million, by the year 2009. Four appendixes contain technical information, supplementary tables, remarks on data sources, and a glossary. (Contains 1 chart, 71 figures, 52 tables; 26 methodological tables, and 13 supplementary  tables. (SLD)",

        "description":"This paper explores the origin and historical background of the &quot;model minority&quot; stereotype. It includes evidence illustrating problems resulting from the artificial grouping of Asian Americans as one ethnic group and the stereotype's influence on young Asian Americans. In the 1960s, the U.S. media began to portray the model minority through academic and economic success stories of Japanese and Chinese students. These reports were generalized to all Asians because the majority group did not pay attention to the differences among Asians. Evidence is presented to rebut the four main themes of the model minority hypothesis: (1) Asian Americans exhibit lower incidents of criminal activity and almost no juvenile delinquency; (2) Asian Americans are physically and mentally healthier  than other Americans; (3) Asian Americans earn higher incomes than other Americans; and (4) Asian American students are higher scholastic achievers than other American students. Evidence exists to counter each of these assumptions. Because of the prevalence of the model minority stereotype, however, many young Asian Americans try to live up to these stereotypes. It is difficult to refute stereotypes that do not contain negative implications on the surface. In addition, the model minority stereotype could have been applied accurately to some early groups of immigrants, who were well-educated and from upper-class families in their home countries. Still, it is not accurate to characterize Asian Americans as though they are all alike. Empirical data prove that the model minority stereotype is  a myth. (Contains 35 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This paper suggests that space and spatiality are major features of racial identity and the formation of student resistance. It brings together critical studies of \"Whiteness,\" human territoriality, and theories of resistance in education. The problems between white teachers and students of color can be understood better through a combination of these three fields. A literature review of critical studies of whiteness suggests that what oppressed people of color need from whites is not sympathy so much as self-reflection and collective reflection on their own white privilege in a system of white racism. One of the most salient features of white racial identity is a denial of white privilege. People of color develop their own racial identities within a complex milieu of social  encounters with whiteness. Critical studies of education have increasingly been concerned with resistance theory over the last few decades. Theories of resistance take as their main focus the perception that students are active constructors of culture rather than passive receivers. Students are also active spatial agents in school, in spite of the school's efforts at control. Academic achievement is not so much about cognitive abilities or skills acquisition as it is about how the territorial practices of teachers and others at a school create alienation, resistance, and community membership. Schools do not provide education that is inclusive of historically disenfranchised students because of the territoriality of whiteness. (Contains 47 references.) (SLD)",

Part 1 describes the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) and provides an overview of results for African Americans. The NALS sample was composed of approximately 13,600 adults, with oversamples of African Americans and Hispanic Americans to provide data for meaningful generalizations and comparisons. Parts 2 and 3 suggest that literacy proficiency is linked to social and economic problems facing African Americans, problems that prevent far too many African Americans from reaching full development. Part 4 discusses literacy proficiency in the context of development. This section suggests a framework for  discussions of literacy based on a concept of development that encompasses the individual, the family, and the community.

The effects of gender on school-related outcomes were studied for students who attended a full 3 or 4 years of high school. The entire analyses treated the gender gap as the dependent variable. There is no evidence for a one-way gender gap favoring males beyond 1992 in public secondary schools. As of 1992, females possess a significant advantage on most central educational outcome indicators. These results suggest that broad nationwide efforts to bring about  gender equity in schools has been effective. Boys, rather than girls, are now on the short end of the gender gap in many secondary school outcomes. (Contains 43 references.) (SLD)",

        "author":["Youngs, Peter"],
        "description":"This paper reports on a study of the impact of an integrated teacher education program for diversity on two beginning teachers and considers the challenges involved in investigating the impact of such programs. The study examined four elementary school teachers in their first or second year of teaching who were working in schools that served high percentages of racial minority and low-income students. Two of the teachers graduated from a master's teacher education program, Teaching in Urban Contexts (TUC), which integrated attention to diversity throughout its courses and field experiences, while the other teachers were trained in programs that used a segregated approach to issues of diversity. Results suggest that the TUC program may have influenced its graduates' expectations  for students, their approach to incorporating students' backgrounds into instruction, the extent to which they collaborated with colleagues, and their level of commitment to school renewal. The paper elaborates on teachers' expectations for students and the incorporation of student backgrounds into instruction. The paper also discusses three challenges in trying to determine the impact of integrated programs for diversity on teachers' practices: (1) that teachers are influenced by their beliefs and experiences as well as their formal preparation; (2) participants in the same program may be differentially affected by program components; and (3) findings from one program for diversity may not apply to other programs.

This is more likely to happen in schools in multicultural societies. Experiences in a long-term research project in Australia illustrate the differences that can occur in negotiating culture in the classroom due to differences in use of literacy. The match and mismatch between the literacy of home and school have been explored in a variety of Australian schools and communities. In the first phase of the project, case studies of four schools with innovative literacy practices were conducted. The second phase involved detailed  observation and discourse analysis of the literacy practices of 35 students from the case study (years 6 and 7). The most recent work focused on detailed studies of student literacy practices and analysis of student, teacher, parent, and community member views of English literacy and support of English literacy in school and the community. Literacy was variously constructed as knowledge, performance, negotiated meaning making, and &quot;doing&quot; school. Research results show that successfully negotiating school literacy involves learning the norms and expectations and ways of participating that are valued in school contexts. Shared understanding is critical to making literacy learners of students. (Contains 29 references.) (SLD)",

This diverse group was studied through examining existing demographic information, conducting interviews with 45 Latino and Anglo individuals, and conducting several focus groups with Latino residents and workers in the county. The Latino population of Dakota County is large and growing rapidly, and the number of Latino children in several of the county's school districts has more than doubled since 1990. Latinos are widely dispersed in the county, however, and this broad population dispersion has resulted in a lack of sense of community. Latinos come to Dakota County to work, find affordable housing, and build  better lives. Education was important among the many issues discussed by Dakota County Latinos. Education was regarded as an important resource, and lack of education was seen as a barrier to advancement. In addition, the cost of the cultural insensitivity Latinos experience in Dakota County is high. Latino organizations, churches, county services, and businesses have provided support for Latinos, but it is apparent that the area has yet to accommodate the new Latino population in any really meaningful way.

The 46 participants were students in grades 2 through 6 from an inner city neighborhood characterized by violence and urban crime. The children came to a neighborhood center once a week for an enrichment and tutoring program. They were asked to draw a picture of what their neighborhood block was like and another picture of what they would like their block to be. A week later the children were guided through telling an original story about their drawings. The children were certainly aware of violence in their environments. Their information fell into three main categories: (1) what the block looks like; (2) the activity of people on the block; and (3)  how they would like the block to look. The voices of these children, expressed in artwork and recreated in story form, became part of a process that might produce energy for other experiences that are part of an enriching school day. Children's ideas about their environment expressed in this way can educate the educator and provide evidence that children are \"meaningmakers\" in their own worlds. (Contains 11 references.) (SLD)",

Parental awareness of their child's homework style reflected the influences of culture and the age of the child, as indicated in the degree of parent-child agreement on children's preferred homework style in the two grades. In general, a higher degree of parental awareness of the child's homework style preferences was associated with a child having higher achievement and more positive attitudes toward homework. Without parental knowledge of individual differences in  learning styles, potentially positive parental influence could be compromised. Cultural differences in the level of support within the home for homework activities and the need for cooperation between teachers and parents in efforts to match home environment with children's strong learning style are discussed.

The school had a well-defined population but did not have a comprehensive approach to anger management, prosocial behavior, and violence prevention strategies. Life at this school was challenging for students and staff. Staff tried to do the best they could with the limited resources they had. They were frustrated by lack of time, supplies, and support.

        "description":"The School Readiness Language Development Program (SRLDP) is one of several programs developed in response to a court order to racially integrate the Los Angeles Unified School District (California). The program, developed for schools with high proportions of minority students, includes oral language development opportunities for 4 year-olds, a payment education component to enhance parenting skills, and staff development. Teachers were surveyed about the effectiveness of the program on their students' achievement. This summary presents results of the teacher survey, completed by 119 teachers from 88 schools. Most SRLDP teachers have solid teaching experience. Overall, they are highly satisfied with the workshops provided for staff development and very satisfied with the  instructional program components they use in their programs. More than half of the teachers used literature, poetry, stories, and journals for all students, and more than half used oral language and English-as-a-Second-Language activities. A major obstacle teachers encountered was the lack of cooperation from parents. A small minority of teachers were overwhelmed by mandated reports and concerned about the lack of administrative support at the school site. Other major obstacles were the lack of classroom centers and convenient bathroom facilities. Recommendations are made for program continuation and improvement. Appendixes contain the tables and the teacher survey. (Contains 14 tables.) (SLD)",

        "author":["Sunderman, Gail L."],
        "description":"This paper examines how the federal accountability mandates affect the design and implementation of schoolwide programs under Title I of the Improving America's Schools Act. It considers the policies adopted by states and districts to meet the accountability mandates, and it examines, at the school level, how the implementation of an accountability framework affects the development of curriculum and instructional processes that allow teachers to work with students at different ability levels. The paper uses data from case studies of Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan, and three districts (Cleveland, Chicago, and Detroit, respectively) to examine these questions. The first section outlines the theoretical perspective of the research. The second describes the research design, and the  third presents the findings. At state, district, and school levels there was a reliance on structural (organizational) changes of outcome controls to create pressure and place constraints on schools. These states and school districts incorporated the federal expectations into their accountability systems by adopting performance and content standards, core curriculum frameworks, and assessment systems. Schools were most likely to rely on organizational changes to accommodate the accountability mandates. Schools in Detroit were less likely to make the organizational changes that were observed in Chicago or Cleveland. The focus on standards-based reform has led to a more integrated approach to curriculum and assessment in Ohio and Illinois, but many questions remain about the implementation  and effectiveness of standards-based reform. An appendix contains tables of study results for each school district. (Contains 12 tables and 23 references.) (SLD)",

It is a method through which young people learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences. Service learning programs are individualized and unique, and to duplicate one program or to expect the same effects from one community to another is nearly impossible. Service learning programs bring many benefits to students. Descriptions of eight service learning programs in the five northwest states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington show some of the possibilities available for service learning. All share the goal of connecting students with the community around them. Included with the description of each program is contact information and tips  for those looking to implement service projects in their schools. The booklet also contains a list of steps in establishing a service learning program. An appendix contains safety guidelines for planning service learning projects. Regional and state contacts are also listed. (Contains 20 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This digest identifies several common types of nontraditional families and presents a few of their characteristics relevant to their children's education. It also offers some recommendations to help schools provide support for the families to ensure their inclusion in all aspects of schooling. Multiracial families comprise both children whose parents have different ethnic heritages and those who themselves are of different ethnicity from their parents. Educators can promote the positive development of multiracial students by treating each child according to his or her unique characteristics. Educators who teach children from families with gay or lesbian parents should respect family views about disclosure and be sensitive to problems children may have resulting from family  secrecy. A growing number of children live in families with grandparents or other relatives. Educators must be alert to the special needs of these children. Their needs, like those of all students, are best met when schools support high standards for all and affirm students' feelings. Both schoolwide and classroom strategies can be used to help students from nontraditional families feel a sense of belonging and receive acceptance and support from peers and teachers.

Schools can be an important source of stability for foster children, whose home lives have been disrupted. Foster children need to believe that they are welcome in school, are treated the same as their classmates, and are safe. Schools need a specific plan for enrolling and integrating foster children. The effort begins with information collection and retrieval so that children receive the services they need. Schools must plan to place foster children appropriately, taking into account social and academic needs. Both curriculum and instruction should be designed to show  children that there are many different configurations of family and to be sensitive to the problems foster children face. Appropriate service delivery, teacher training and assignment, and efforts to promote parent participation are important aspects of a school's plan for dealing with foster children, who may need extra attention to build a good foundation for later life.

The growth in enrollment in Utah's schools since 1977 has primarily resulted from internal growth, with a secondary increase because of migration. From 1977, enrollment increased at a strong 2.2% or more a year until 1987. Then, in a period of economic recession, growth dipped below 2.2% until 1990. The rate remained at 2.1% for 2 years, and has since declined to less than 1.0% per year. This decline is a demographic phenomenon as the baby boomers leave the child-bearing years. It is projected that statewide enrollment rates will increase after the year 2000. As reflected in the 1997 total enrollment percentages, most students by  race/ethnic category also live in four metropolitan counties. Most of Utah's minority group students live in these counties, with the exception of American Indians, who are more likely to live in rural areas. There are only six states with less racial and ethnic diversity than Utah, where about 89% of the students are white. Other groups are experiencing strong growth in percentage terms, although there numbers are still small. Hispanics are experiencing a 7.5% growth rate, and there were over 31,000 Hispanic students enrolled in 1997. Tables contain information about the state's 40 school districts.

This paper develops the notion of the space-between, a heuristic device to analyze and explain girls' experiences of contemporary events in education. It explores the lack of change in post-school outcomes for girls, the insignificant degree of change in the participation of girls in male-dominated curriculum areas, the endemic nature of sexual harassment, and the inequitable use of school resources by girls. Women's experiences in the space-between revolve around the conflicting discourses of equality with men and of male supremacy in which women are  constructed as transgressors on male territory. Desire for achievement and threat to masculinity are dialectical experiences of girls' schooling in the Australian context. (Contains 24 references.) (SLD)",

A national study has been designed to investigate the compliance and effectiveness of urban schoolwide Title I programs. As part of this study, the SouthEastern Regional Vision for Education (SERVE) selected the Empowerment Zone within the Atlanta (Georgia) city limit that includes the Atlanta public school system. One high-performing school and one school with scores lower than expected were studied through surveys of parents, teachers, principals, and students and interviews with principals and teachers, supplemented by classroom observations. Parent surveys  revealed that legislative expectations, such as high standards, were being implemented at the more effective school. Teachers and principals also thought that Title I was bringing new opportunities to the school. At this school, teachers consistently identified the school's vision for learning in terms of high standards for students. Parents and teachers at the less effective school were much less certain of the role of Title I in fulfilling its legislative expectations, and much less sure of the school's mission. Implications for improved schoolwide practices derived from this study center on leadership by principals, who must have knowledge of the possibilities of educational improvement under Title I.

        "description":"The 1991 National Household Education Survey adult education component, a household-based data collection, provided estimates of adult education participation. About 32 percent of adults participated in adult education during the prior 12 months to the 1991 survey. Adults 25-54 years old, persons with a bachelor's degree or higher, and employed persons tended to participate at a higher rate. More than one-half were female; most were white. Nearly 60 percent of course taking was to improve or advance in a current job--a pattern more evident for males than females. Almost 65 percent of course taking by employed persons was to improve or advance in current jobs; 58.9 percent by those not in the labor force was for personal or social reasons; and 82 percent by unemployed persons was  a requirement for a degree or diploma, training for a new job, and job improvement or advancement. Men were more likely to take courses provided by business and industry, women to take courses provided by four- or two-year colleges. Labor unions and professional associations were among the larger providers to persons working in management and professional fields. Common sources of financial support were the business community or participants. Over 60 percent of all course taking had some type of employer involvement. Nonparticipants were less likely to report barriers to participation. Work schedules, meeting times, costs, and family responsibilities were among the barriers identified.

        "description":"The arts deserve a place in education, provided they are properly taught. Humans need art to make their world sensible, find patterns in their experiences, and gain insights into the future. Art, like life, rewards those who grasp new patterns and act on their interpretation of reality. A good education imparts the ability to recognize patterns and act on the resulting information. Economic change and increasing economic pressures are threatening the funding of many arts education programs. Arts educators must, therefore, change their approach to arts education and learn to marry the arts and relevant workplace know-how. If they are properly taught, knowledge of the arts can help equip all students with the know-how needed in the 21st century workplace. This help can come in at  least three interrelated forms: (1) experiences in the arts that teach skills that can be transferred to the workplace; (2) knowledge of the arts that enhances effective communication; and (3) an &quot;artful&quot; approach to problem solving. The process of integrating important workplace skills into arts education is evident in the list of workplace competencies identified by the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills that were successfully incorporated into the curriculum of an 8-week theater arts project.

Based largely on questions from the Statistics Canada (SC) School Leavers Survey and SC Graduates Study (1997), the telephone survey focused on these elements: background and demographic variables; high school experience; post-high school employment and education; skills used in current employment; and perceptions of where particular skills were acquired. A preliminary path analysis revealed significant variables contributing to high school and postsecondary experiences, skill development and use, and workplace outcomes. Cohorts differed notably in factors contributing to attainment at high  school and postsecondary levels. Gender differences existed at the high school level on a range of outcomes from grades, completion rates, and goal setting; gender was not a significant factor contributing to postsecondary enrollment and completion. Background factors were more important predictors of economic and educational outcomes than participation in a particular educational program. Males made more money than females, and a postsecondary credential was associated with permanent employment and pay satisfaction. Communication skills were consistently rated most important in current jobs, and working with others was rated second most important. On-the-job learning and general life experience were viewed as important to development of all skill areas more frequently than were secondary  or postsecondary education. (Contains 29 references.)

Over 3 years, 5 National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) staff undertook a series of visits to 20 sample projects and read project documentation; in addition, 3 surveys of projects, 4 national seminars, and 2 national conferences were conducted. The study found that the principal target groups addressed by the 46 projects (many targeted several groups) were ethnic minorities, women, rural communities, people with disabilities, and older adults. Almost all the projects placed their highest priorities and greatest areas of success in the following activities: (1) developing partnerships with  external agencies; (2) developing advice and guidance for potential students and for nontraditional students already enrolled in the institution; and (3) changing public perceptions of higher education. Projects also saw priorities but with lower levels of success in changing the culture of their institution, changing institutional structures and processes, and changing curriculum. The evaluation concluded that the projects were most successful in reaching targeted groups when a multiple-strand approach was undertaken, when the institution was fully committed to the projects, when a project-based approach was used, and when special funding was provided.

An evaluation of the projects was conducted after 4 years, using structured data from a large sample of the projects, data from an in-depth study of a selected group of projects, and policy analysis within a historical and policy framework to determine the impact of funding the projects. The study found that the HEFCE funding was an enabling force for many of the higher education institutions to conduct the projects, and noted some of the  following effects: (1) substantial curriculum and pedagogical innovation has flowed from the initiative; (2) recruitment and admissions to the continuing vocational education programs showed least development; (3) the range of evaluation, monitoring, and assessment procedures was extensive; and (4) development funding fostered a range of innovations, such as work-based learning, in-company mentoring, open and distance learning, accreditation of prior experiential learning, and multimedia instruction, and these innovations had a significant impact on widening participation and access for previously under-served groups. The analysis suggested a strong link between continuing vocational education and economic improvement and pointed to the need to continue and broaden such educational  efforts and innovation.

        "description":"Adult literacy is a context-dependent, purposeful, and constantly changing phenomenon. What counts for literacy at the end of the 20th century is not what counted for literacy at the beginning of the century. Literacy is the ability to read, use written information, and write appropriately in a range of contexts. Literacy also includes the recognition and meaning of numbers and basic mathematical formulas within texts. Literacy must change over a lifetime. The 1989 national survey of adult literacy in Australia (No Single Measure) broke new ground by adopting a definition of literacy as social practice. The most recent evidence of the extent of literacy and numeracy difficulties experienced by Australia's population comes from the 1996 Survey of Aspects of Literacy (SAL)  (n=9,302). By conducting the SAL, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) became part of the International Adult Literacy Survey. According to the ABS survey, the percentages of Australians with very poor, poor, moderate, and good/very good literacy skills are 19%, 26%, 35%, and 17%, respectively. The decision to base literacy programs on a remedial or developmental approach will depend on how literacy is defined. The ABS survey also showed a clear link between literacy and work.

In the current information environment, consumers need the blend of skills and abilities that has been variously referred to as information literacy, critical literacy, media literacy, or digital literacy. This form of literacy combines the skills of locating, selecting, organizing, and synthesizing information with critical analysis, interpretation, and application of the results to solve problems and make decisions. Several approaches to teaching the World Wide Web (WWW) have been proposed, including an eight-step modular  approach that includes the following: (1) basic concepts; (2) using the WWW for research; (3) basic WWW searching; (4) comparing WWW subject directories; (5) comparing WWW search engines; (6) advanced WWW search techniques; (7) evaluating WWW resources; and (8) synthesizing WWW research strategies. Other resources available to help consumer educators teach the critical literacy skills needed to navigate the WWW safely and successfully include a set of lesson plans and activities that are especially suited to adults and detailed checklists for teaching information source evaluation.

        "description":"According to the school-to-work (STW) program philosophy, STW efforts should be comprehensive and begin as early as preschool. At the elementary school level, the developmental process of career education begins with career awareness designed to broaden student knowledge about careers and connect academic learning to the workplace. Developing basic, academic, and employability skills represents another major component of students' STW education that, when linked with career awareness, provides a strong foundation for a successful STW system. The main challenge for elementary school teachers teaching STW is to create an environment where students see the connection between school learning and the real world. Strategies for making this connection include the following:  student-centered teaching, contextual teaching and learning experiences, and collaborative and cooperative learning opportunities. Integrating curriculum across subjects and establishing business-community partnerships are two of the most common practices for promoting STW connections at the elementary school level. These practices must be incorporated into a broader school vision for STW that includes the following: (1) carefully selected community partners; (2) curriculum aligned with the STW mission; (3) adequate financial resources; (4) linking of academics and careers; (5) professional development of staff; and (6) building on existing school strengths. Successful STW programs are described. (Contains 12 references) (MN)",

        "description":"Although large companies are more apt to provide training than smaller companies are, size is becoming less of a predictor of training than complexity of the environment, degree of market competition, and internal makeup of the company. The increasingly technological nature of the workplace has prompted many small businesses to increase their spending on training. In most of the 6 million U.S. small businesses with fewer than 50 employees, training is usually offered in house on an informal and sometimes random basis. Forms of employer-provided training include the following: on-the-job training by mentors and co-workers; seminars and speakers; classroom instruction; one-on-one training; training partnerships with other businesses and suppliers; and vendor training provided by  suppliers. Because many small companies lack technology specialists or time for technology specialists to train other employees, approximately one-third of all small businesses resort to outsourced training delivered by training companies or educational institutions. Trainers in small businesses face time, space, and staff restrictions because of limited funding for their efforts, as well as attitudinal obstacles.

        "description":"Discussion of business ethics rests on rather ambiguous grounds. What one person considers highly unethical can be legitimate in another person's eye. Many businesses operate under tenets that, although not illegal, most people would consider unethical. Having the ability to distinguish between ethical and unethical practices does not guarantee that a business owner will consistently choose the ethical decision. Business owners need to realize the tremendous benefits of operating an ethical company and severe disadvantages of using unethical operations. Guidelines that can help them create or improve the ethical standards within their companies include the following: (1) if the company has committed a serious error, do not attempt to cover it up; (2) create a believable public  commitment to ethical operations; (3) establish a strategy to communicate the ethics guidelines to the staff; (4) build trust with employees and constantly monitor the ethics program; (5) hire people who can uphold the company's high ethical standards; and (5) realize that company executives are role models. Trust is one of the company's most vital assets. Maintaining the highest ethical standards adds to a company's value and success. Consequences of success in an unethical business are short lived. If customers or clients learn a company cheats, they may never return. A business cannot operate successfully if employees abuse sick days, cut corners on quality, lie to colleagues, cover up incidents, deceive customers, and take credit for co-workers' ideas. (YLB)",

These social entrepreneurs exhibit all the skills of successful businesspeople and a powerful desire for social change. Others have described them as follows: (1) pathbreakers with a powerful new idea, who combine visionary and real-world problem-solving creativity, have a strong ethical fiber, and are totally possessed by their vision for change; (2) people who attempt to take innovative approaches to social and other issues; and (3) pioneers who are discovering that entrepreneurship can help them meet community needs and become more financially self-sufficient. The raw materials of social entrepreneurship include the  following: candor, passion, clarity in mission, commitment, core values, customer-driven products and services, sound business concepts, a willingness to plan and build the right team, have sufficient resources, and an ability to improvise. For-profit and nonprofit entrepreneurs are different. For-profit entrepreneurs get strength from personal skills and knowledge, focus on short-term financial gain, have no limit on scope of ideas, have profit as an end, and pocket or reinvest profit for further profit. Social entrepreneurs get strength from collective wisdom and experience, focus on long-term capacity, have ideas limited by mission, have profit as a means, and put profit into serving people. More colleges are offering programs or courses focusing on social entrepreneurship. (Four  Internet resources for social entrepreneurs are summarized.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Ecopreneurs are entrepreneurs whose business efforts are not only driven by profit, but also by a concern for the environment. Ecopreneurship, also known as environmental entrepreneurship and eco-capitalism, is becoming more widespread as a new market-based approach to identifying opportunities for improving environmental quality and capitalizing upon them in the private sector for profit. It is defined as entrepreneurs using business tools to preserve open space, develop wildlife habitat, save endangered species, and improve environmental quality. Most ecopreneurial endeavors begin at the local level, addressing a community environmental problem or need. An example is the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch, which has a mission to foster peaceful and productive coexistence between  wildlife and ranching. Another example is a Chamber of Commerce that has set up an operation to clean for free the paddlefish local fishermen catch in the Yellowstone River in return for the paddlefish eggs the fishermen had usually discarded and left to rot. Half of the proceeds from sale of the caviar go to fund community projects and half go to the state for paddlefish research and management. Examples of ecopreneurial tourism are the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center outside of Dallas, a for-profit corporation that provides a sanctuary for endangered animals that serve as the main attraction to tourists, and state parks that provide rental services and mail-order catalogs of novelty items.

Together, the Baldrige Criteria and ISO Standards meet the requirements for developing a high-performance educational system that successfully delivers students who have mastered state-mandated curriculum and student work standards. ISO 9000/Baldrige Criteria provides public education with a quality management system that achieves measurable quality and continuous improvement. A school system that undertakes ISO compliance gains many operational benefits plus improved efficiency and  effectiveness through a bottoms-up planning and organizing system. With ISO/Baldrige, schools now have a single, cogent, understandable, and workable methodology to apprise them of their greatest opportunities for systemic reform. A decade-long effort of industry-education collaboration has succeeded in getting states to include two of three elements for school system accountability and a total quality assurance system: standards and assessment. Quality control, the keystone element, is missing. Quality assurance instills an attitude of disciplined caring toward poor results in education. NAIEC is uniquely suited to conduct the ISO 9000/Baldrige initiative as the nation's principal advocate and resource for fostering industry-education collaboration. (YLB)",

To date, the course has been offered by a diverse range of providers ranging from correctional institutions in Victoria to a remote aboriginal community in North Queensland. In 1998, a teacher from the Council of Adult Education's (CAE's) English as a second language department and a teacher in CAE's general education department began working together to increase adult education providers' access to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC's) educational resources. After providing  professional development courses for primary and secondary teachers for some time, the AEC has now joined with the Victoria Law Foundation to provide adult educators with professional development activities in explaining the constitutional issues surrounding the mechanics of Australia's existing referendum system and introducing tasks and activities that teachers can modify for their respective adult learners' needs. The response to these professional development courses for adult educators has provided convincing evidence that there is a significant place for political literacy activities in AE. (MN)",

Adults from different walks of life may seek out learning at different times in their lives, for different reasons, and for vastly different purposes. Adult learning groups may include students of different ages, cultures, and educational and socioeconomic backgrounds. Adult education is provided in diverse settings for diverse purposes: from community education classes to workplace training. Adults seek out learning situations for various reasons, including the following: to achieve a predetermined goal; to fill a gap in education; to explore options and make choices; and for personal development, family, social, or community reasons. Teachers/trainers in adult education programs must  become familiar with some of the general theories related to adult learning processes and must recognize and accommodate the reciprocal relationships between teaching and learning. A range of theories of adult education and learning exist along with a corresponding range of teaching methodologies, such as the following: traditional (teacher as expert); self-actualization (facilitated problem solving); humanist (teacher stimulates and suggests); revolutionary (teachers and learners are equal participants); and organizational effectiveness (curriculum is determined by organizational needs). Most adults have a preferred learning style. Adults may be primarily active, reflective, theorizing, or experiential learners. Motivation is critical to adult learning. Also included are a number of  reerences for readers requiring further information. (13 references) (MN)",

        "description":"Taiwan's commercial high schools are 3-year institutions that students enter after successfully passing a rigorous vocational, technical, or commercial school admission examination. Although commercial high schools date from the early days of Japanese occupation in 1895, the modern-day Chinese commercial high school did not come into being until 1945. Unlike technical/vocational schools, commercial high schools focus on areas of study that are both academic and relevant to the world of office work, language, computers, international business, and other commercially important areas. Taiwan currently has 106 commercial high schools serving 197,000 students. Commercial high schools may be set up and run by the government or private investors under the direction of a board of  trustees and the administration of a principal with an average of 20 years in public education. Eighty-five percent of graduates of commercial high schools find immediate employment. As is the case in other components of Taiwan's educational system, prolongation of the childhood experience is on the agenda of Taiwan's educational authorities. Although commercial high schools have always played an important role in Taiwan's economic development, the issue of how they can make an even greater contribution to the nation's economic prosperity has become a major concern.

A descriptive research methodology was used; a letter was sent to all 25 Outstanding Research Award recipients asking them to identify the personal, professional, and organizational impact of receiving their awards. Twenty-four award recipients responded, and  text analysis and thematic analysis were conducted to determine the themes among the responses to the research questions. The results included 158 themes and 17 impacts. Under personal impacts, the three most frequently reported were self-confidence, pride, and professionalism. For the professional impact,  professionalism, recognition, and opportunity were reported. Under organizational type, no self-reaction impact was identified; pride was the social reaction impact, and reputation was the material consequence impact. The following recommendations were made: (1) the NFA should publish articles in fire service magazines on the winners and their research; (2) a press kit should be developed for winners to use with their local media; (3) a letter of congratulations should be sent from the President of the United States to the winners; and (4) Congressional letters of congratulations from the winners' senators and representatives should be sent to the winners in order to enhance the professional impact of the reward.

Among the success factors discussed are the following: teacher teams; administrator commitment; employer commitment; design teams; learning by working; technology; transfer of teacher learning; and ongoing evaluation. In the second booklet, actual comments of  more than 30 teacher interns who participated in the internship program are used to explain how the program is enabling business and teachers to change student learning. Among the topics covered in their comments are the following: closing the gap between school and work; creating valuable teacher internship experiences; and changing student learning by bringing skills to life in the classroom and changing the curriculum to capitalize on teacher interns' work experience. Concluding the booklet are profiles of the grantees and a list of teacher respondents. (MN)",

        "description":"A phenomenological hermeneutic approach was used to explore the process of being and becoming a distance learner and ways the distance learning environment is inhabited or known. The study's author analyzed her own distance learning experiences and those of three other individuals (two females and one male) with an interest in education and distance learning experience at the undergraduate and/or graduate levels. After reviewing the literature on phenomenology, hermeneutics, and distance and lifelong learning, the study's author recorded her own experiences and the personal narratives of her three \"co-researchers\" in detail. Finally, she reflected on all four personal narratives from the standpoint of the symbiotic relationship between distance learning, lifelong learning, and  personal development. The following were among her 10 recommendations regarding distance learning: (1) distance learners must take ownership of their learning situation by being responsible for their learning as more independent and self-directed learners; (2) although self-pacing is important, keeping the cohort experience is advantageous; (3) the issue of isolation/connection must be addressed; and (4) although technological tools are an asset, the human element must not get lost.

        "author":["Riccio, James A."],
        "description":"This report describes the Jobs-Plus approach, an attempt to transform low-work, high-welfare public housing developments into high-work, low-welfare communities. It highlights the rationale of the approach, the way the demonstration has been set up to test the approach in the field, and what has been accomplished so far by the seven cities chosen to design and implement Jobs-Plus at the local level. Chapter 1 provides the context by discussing the problem of concentrated joblessness in inner cities and public housing and the growing policy interest in creating a better mix of income groups within public housing by increasing residents' employment. Chapter 2 discusses the three components of Jobs-Plus (employment-related activities and support services, financial incentives to  work, and community support for work) and why they were considered important to achieving the program's goals. Chapter 3 describes the characteristics of the housing developments where Jobs-Plus is operating and how and why the cities they are in were selected for the demonstration. Chapters 4-5 discuss the sites' early practices and experiences, first in building the local partnerships that were to design and operate Jobs-Plus and then in crafting the program's three main components to fit local conditions. Interspersed throughout chapter 5 are profiles of each site's emerging Jobs-Plus program. Chapter 5 ends with a note on the next steps in the study. Appendixes summarize the overall research plan for evaluating Jobs-Plus. Contain 47 references. (YLB)",

The competency statements covered these areas: basic communication, consumer economics, community resources, health, employment, government and law, computation, and learning to learn. Stakeholders rated each competency statement as very important, important, somewhat important, or not important, with numeric ratings from 4 to 1, respectively. Average scores for each competency statement by each respondent group, scores for each competency area by each  respondent group, weighted aggregate responses, and competency area mean ratings were computed from responses on the 4,245 useable questionnaires returned. As an aggregate, stakeholders rated basic communication highest, then employment, learning to learn, and health and gave computation, consumer economics, community resources, and government and law its lowest ratings. Business and industry providers' competency area rankings were almost identical to the aggregate's. Learners ranked health highest, then basic communication and employment. Instructional service providers' rankings were most similar to those of learners and least similar to those of business and industry providers. State agencies and public service providers' rankings were most similar to those of the aggregate and  business and industry providers. Recommendations were made to improve curriculum, instruction, and assessment and to focus program planning, staff development, and program coordination. Contains 13 tables. (YLB)",

        "description":"As American society has changed from the industrial age to the information age to the knowledge/imagination age, the notion of a comprehensive high school in its originally envisioned form has again become a high priority. If all students are required to obtain a rigorous academic education and an applied education related to a life or work interest, they have the opportunity to change their minds about future life goals and instructional programs as they move through high school. Changed expectations have led to a major movement to teach academic basics in a more functional manner around real-life applications and to ensure that career preparation programs are focused on the broad range of skills required in the workplace. Vocational education can no longer prepare students for  direct entry into the world of work as skilled workers in a highly technological society. States are designing educational systems that provide specialized occupational preparation at the post-high-school level. To modify vocational education to meet new expectations, major concepts that affect curriculum design have been evolving: career majors, career activities, applied instruction, project-based instruction, integration, and articulation. Changes in vocational education curriculum practices are course goals, course content, who should deliver instruction and how it should be delivered, and evaluation of vocational course achievement. Steps in developing the new career major curriculum are to determine a school's career majors and sample careers within each major and to identify which  courses to include.

        "description":"Both the rapid movement to the knowledge/imagination age and a more thorough understanding of how problem-solving skills are developed challenge traditional education to change and adopt a new set of goals. Academic and vocational education are modifying their goals and instructional procedures, and they are blending together. As technology has evolved, the nature of work and preparation for work has changed. Tracking students into college preparatory, vocational, or general programs is not sensible now, when the nature of work does not have one group of individuals directing work and another group conducting the procedural aspects of work. In the modern workplace, the nature of much work has changed; separating those who implement the procedural aspects from those who design,  supervise, and direct the work is difficult. Given this changed context for work, the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills has identified generalizable skills required in most workplaces as a basis for preparing people for employment. In response to such new life and workplace requirements, the educational community has defined a set of Criteria for the New American High School. Tech prep and the Southern Regional Education Board's High Schools that Work are two exemplary reform programs that ensure that all students have a rigorous academic background, develop technological literacy, and have realistic experiences in real world environments as contextual references for their learning.

        "description":"Since the introduction of one-stop employment systems, many states have attempted to merge traditional employment and training services to provide consolidated programs and easier customer access to services. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA), passed in 1998, requires the formation of locally based one-stop service delivery systems to deliver many federally funded employment and training services. Four principles have guided development of the one-stop system: universal access, customer choice, service integration, and accountability. In contrast to the Job Training Partnership Act, which focused on providing training to economically disadvantaged individuals, the WIA requires delivery of one-stop services at three levels: core services, intensive services, and training  services. Core services, which must be made available to all interested individuals, include access to career information resources. Intensive services include counseling, case management, and short-term prevocational services. Training services are reserved strictly for individuals who are unable to benefit through core and intensive services, with priority given to public assistance recipients and low-income individuals. The following are among the issues related to further development of the one-stop system: universal access to core services; collaboration with the welfare system; assessment of services; and serving employers.

        "description":"From its beginnings in 1906, cooperative education has evolved into a program offered at the secondary and postsecondary levels in two predominant models: (1) students complete multiple cycles of equal periods of academic coursework and paid employment; and (2) students' school day is split between school (usually in the morning) and work (usually in the afternoon). Despite informal and anecdotal evidence that cooperative education benefits students in numerous ways, documentation of cooperative education's benefits through empirical research has been difficult for several reasons. Although some institutions are fully dedicated to the cooperative education ideal, many others view cooperative education as an add-on and, therefore, as a target for cost cutting. Several researchers  have pointed out that social, economic, and historic forces are making cooperative education more relevant than ever. It has been suggested that cooperative education be redesigned as a curriculum model linking work and academics by fostering self-directed learning, reflective practice, and transformative learning and integrating school and work experiences that are grounded in adult learning theories. Because cooperative education is inherently committed to improving the economy, people's working lives, and lifelong learning abilities, it can position itself to serve students' experiential learning needs into the 21st century.

        "description":"Multicultural perspectives on assessment challenge traditional perspectives by advancing an additional source of variation in test responses that is presumed to escape test developers and test users. Increasing and convergent evidence from multiple sources indicates the following types of ethnocentric errors in test development, administration, and interpretation: misdiagnosis, labeling, inappropriate treatment planning, and erroneous conclusions about intervention effectiveness. In 1995, Sedlacek and Kim described four common errors in career assessment. Focus on multicultural assessment issues has since increased; however, the main focus has been on assessments of abilities and psychopathology. Career assessment has traditionally concentrated on assessment of the individual and  has emphasized measurement of abilities, personality traits, interests, and various career theory constructs (maturity, indecision, self-efficacy). Reviews should be conducted of the major instruments available for classifying individuals in terms of abilities, personality traits, and vocational interests to determine their fairness to individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Attention to multicultural assessment in the area of typical performance is still in its &quot;infancy&quot; relative to the area of maximal performance, which is in its &quot;adolescence.&quot; Test developers could profit from considering and implementing the concept of Sensitivity Review Guidelines and Principles, which are available on the World Wide Web.

        "description":"Globalization of the economy and rapid technological innovation challenge today's work force to prepare for continuous change. In response to a strong mandate from their membership, labor unions have formed partnerships to deliver the necessary worker education. Because they are in daily contact with workers and have a holistic knowledge of individual workers' needs, labor unions are in an excellent position to provide worker education. To meet the work force's education needs effectively, however, unions must form new partnerships with management, community organizations, and statutory bodies. One of the most dramatic changes in labor union-sponsored work force education is its broad scope. Many employee development programs now seek to promote workplace learning beyond firms'  narrowly defined business interests. This broad-based learning addresses the challenge of turning novices into experts. Literacy issues underlie many educational initiatives. Labor-sponsored, worker-centered learning programs are democratic in structure and involve discussion facilitators who use a wide variety of exercises and activities to encourage participatory learning. Many labor unions are taking a hard line on educational equity issues and focusing on low-paid, low-status, or female employees. Increasing educational access for these union members means eliminating physical barriers to educational participation. (Contains 19 references.) (MN)",

        "description":"Many studies have verified that education beyond high school results in higher earnings. The highest earnings benefits depend upon certification or degree achievement. Not obtaining a degree results in some penalty: individuals who have some college credit but no degree earn less than associate degree holders. Professional and vocational certificate holders exhibit a wide range of salary differences. Furthermore, certain professions such as accounting afford higher earnings to those who have met state licensing requirements. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the slowing growth rate of college-level jobs will likely result in 65,000 fewer college-level jobs, resulting in 18 percent more new college graduate job seekers than openings for college-level jobs. Professional  specialty occupations and service occupations requiring an associate's degree rather than a bachelor's degree are targeted as the fastest-growing occupations. Technical certification of skills is of increasing importance to employers, especially when they have been involved in setting the certification standards. To function in a continually changing and global marketplace, everyone must engage in lifelong learning and skill development. One increasing trend evident in community colleges is &quot;reverse transfer,&quot; where graduates of four-year colleges return to postsecondary education to obtain more marketable skills.

For example, in 1990, more than 40 percent of Finnish companies acted as hosts for students and teachers. There is a need to make these visits more meaningful and active. Other recent practices in Finland are to include work experience in lower secondary school and to include it in primary and upper secondary levels. The reasons for enterprise education are societal, vocational, behavioral, and educational. The development and implementation of educational policy supporting enterprise education started with seven projects started by the National Board of Education in 1993. The idea of partnering projects between schools and companies is a good one, but a national model might  not be practical. Instead, a national focus on enterprise education and dedication to developing that concept throughout the country are needed. (Contains 22 references.) (KC)",

Chapter 3 examines the following: the roles residents played during the planning phase and their relationships with site staff; how and why these roles and relationships changed and became a great deal more challenging and  uncertain during initial program implementation; the strategies that sites used to overcome these challenges; and the range of roles that residents adopted as implementation progressed. The last chapter offers lessons from the Plain Talk and CCYD experiences and explores implications of these lessons for practitioners, program designers, and policymakers. (YLB)",

Educators and school reformers are updating curricula and redesigning school programs to ensure that, in addition to academics, young people have opportunities to learn work-related skills and attitudes. A situative study of workplace skills that included case studies of students involved in building a transportation system and caring for patients at home demonstrated how worksite observation experiences enable students to learn needed job skills, &quot;generic&quot; skills, and work-related dispositions within the context of specific work cultures. The case studies demonstrated how skills become multi-dimensional when learned within the context of actual  work and how contextualized learning promotes the ability to use information drawn from a range of academic disciplines to perform tasks and solve unique problems. Research has established the essential components for framing high school courses and/or programs around authentic tasks and apprenticeship methods and around teaching the following: complex reasoning skills, work-related attitudes, cooperative skills, job-specific knowledge, and academic knowledge. Contextualized learning requires that teachers do the following: become master practitioners among student apprentices; gain exposure to the world of work; and adapt their teaching to support authentic learning.

A high school curriculum that helps all students master FM would effectively address issues of both equity and competitiveness. All students would have equal opportunity to master the mathematics required for the new world of work. To achieve its goal of preparing students both for work and for further education, FM respects the many parts of the traditional curriculum that are broadly useful, while including topics such as spreadsheets, data analysis, and statistical quality control that are hardly ever part of high school mathematics.  In FM, utility is center stage. The elements of FM can be embedded in many different curricula, but any mathematics curriculum designed on functional grounds emphasizes authentic applications from everyday life and work. It requires appropriate content, authentic contexts, engaging tasks, and active learning. FM provides a rich foundation of experience and examples on which students can build subsequent abstractions and generalizations. It addresses many needs that are otherwise often neglected, including the technical and problem-solving needs of the contemporary workforce or the modern demands of active citizenship.

Current procedures do not reflect integrated curriculum and applied learning, and they penalize multidisciplinary project and work-based learning program participants. Four states have implemented competency-based admissions policies and procedures. California's Transitions project has designed secondary school instruments reporting student achievement and potential in the language of performance. The University of Wisconsin's Competency-Based Admissions System gives diversely prepared students an alternative method for admission consideration. Oregon's Proficiency-Based Admissions Standards System prepares  more students to do college-level work successfully and enables them to make better choices concerning their academic program and subsequent careers. Washington's competency-based admissions plan creates a pathway to college for students taking nontraditional courses. Conclusions about the use of changing admissions for students in a career-oriented curriculum are as follows: (1) considerable time and resources are needed to develop new admissions assessment strategies and materials; (2) vocational-technical educators have seldom participated in these developmental efforts; and (3) the impact of these initiatives on educators is significant.

The following topics are covered: protecting the confidentiality of student records, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The discussion of the FERPA explains which institutions must comply, how the FERPA is enforced (including its penalties), which documents are and are not considered student records, who has rights to student records, when student records may be disclosed to others, what rights parents and students have to review records, what rights parents and students have to challenge the content of student records, what limitations the FERPA imposes  on the retention of student records, what schools tell parents and students about their rights, and how the FERPA applies to student records maintained by state education agencies. Samples of the following FERPA forms are included: Request to Review an Education Record, Consent Form to Parent/Student Request to Review an Education Record, Consent Form to Permit Accompanying Person to Review an Education Record, Request to Amend an Education Record, Notification of Approval/Disapproval of Request for an Amendment, Notice of Hearing on Request for an Amendment to Education Records, Model Notification of Rights for Elementary and Secondary Institutions, and Model Notification of Rights for Postsecondary Institutions.

Unlike the traditional psychoeducational process in which the relationship between the school psychologist and the teacher is that of consultant and consultee, this approach establishes a reciprocal, interdependent working partnership. On the basis of this cooperative association, a mutually agreed upon curriculum-based intervention plan was devised and implemented for a second-grade student who concomitantly demonstrated behavioral problems. Results of the intervention show that the student's reading ability and his desire to pay attention during class time increased, while his  off-task and disruptive behaviors decreased. (MKA)",

        "description":"This paper explores moral sensitivity in Finnish secondary school teachers and students. Moral sensitivity comprises capacities to identify and interpret different kinds of situations in the ethical framework; it is the awareness of how our actions affect other people. In the teaching profession, teachers have to consider different lines of action in dealing with their students, parents, and colleagues. An important challenge is to become aware that moral issues are involved in these interactive relations. Moral sensitivity in teaching requires readiness to identify and solve moral dilemmas at school. In the learning process, students are exposed to different subjects and scientific issues defined by the curriculum. Moral sensitivity in learning includes awareness of moral  dilemmas in the learning environment and capabilities to reflect on them with empathy and role-taking skills. Furthermore, learning should include critical reflection on scientific issues from an ethical point of view. The challenge for both teachers and students is to become aware of the ethical frameworks and the knowledge base that is guiding their moral reasoning. This paper presents some empirical findings of the moral dilemmas teachers and students have identified as relevant in their teaching and learning. A special emphasis is placed on the moral knowledge that guides their argumentation in justifying moral decision-making in these cases. (Contains 4 figures and 15 references.) (MKA)",

        "author":["Tebb, Kathleen P."],
        "description":"This study evaluated Sister Friend, a mentoring program in Yolo County, California, serving low-income adolescent mothers and their infants. The primary objective was to determine if participating in the Sister Friend program improved the adolescent mother's parenting class attendance, the home environment, parenting behavior, and child development outcomes. This study employed a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of Sister Friend. It compared adolescent mothers participating in both the Sister Friend and Cal Learn programs with a similar group of mothers receiving only Cal Learn services. Data was collected upon entry into the Sister Friend Program and again 6 months later. The second aim of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the Sister Friend  program. Interviews with adolescent mothers and their mentors examined how frequently adolescent mothers met with their mentors, the types of activities they were involved in, program support for the match, and the quality of their relationship. In spite of a small sample, this study found that adolescent mothers and their infants participating in the Sister Friend program had significantly better outcomes than those in the Cal Learn-only group. Recommendations are made for future research and an integrated service delivery system for adolescent mothers and their children. Appendix A provides copies of the assessment tools used in the study; Appendix B is the Infant and Toddler Immunization Schedule; Appendix C provides the HOME inter-observer reliability coefficients; and Appendix D  provides examples of existing services for adolescent mothers and their infants in Yolo County.

The difference between therapists' level of understanding and clients' feeling of being understood (the size of this difference and its sign indicating the \"realism\" of the participants' interpersonal perspectives) are examined. Results do not support a relationship between time in therapy and an increase in clients'  sense of feeling understood by their therapists or therapists' actual understanding of their clients on the dimensions studied. Results do indicate that clients consistently overestimate their therapists' level of understanding; that is, they feel more understood than they actually are.

One hundred thirteen African American adolescents completed research packets. Results of ANOVA (analysis of variance) do not indicate any differences among the students in self-esteem, ethnic identity, or cross-cultural interaction behaviors; however, there are significant correlations between self-esteem and ethnic identity as well as between self-esteem and cross-cultural interaction behaviors. Results suggest that school and community counselors and psychologists who work with African  American adolescents should note the relationship between self-esteem and ethnic identity. Counselors and psychologists working in highly culturally diverse environments should help students learn to use multiple methods of cross-cultural interactions to increase their self-esteem.

Several recommendations for assessment of grieving families are offered. Recommendations include evaluating the level of functioning of individual family members and the family system itself, assessing the levels of communication within and cohesion of the family, and assessing symptomology related to depression and bereavement. A systemic approach that emphasizes family, group, and  school interventions is recommended to assist the family in positive grief resolution. (Contains 21 references.) (GCP)",

Observations, a written survey, 21 pilot interviews, and document analysis are used as part of the interpretive case study findings. This paper also introduces Appiah's concept of life &quot;scripts&quot; to illustrate how the pursuit of authenticity may limit choices. It concludes that the considerable value English majors place on the pursuit of authenticity suggests an explanation as to why students pursue their interest in humanities studies (a nonpecuniary good) at a potentially high cost as measured in terms of future earnings potential (and the pecuniary goods those earning can buy). As women  disproportionately choose humanities subjects, which emphasize personal and intellectual development, women may also place a disproportionate emphasis on identity development as a goal of college learning and occupational preparation. This study demonstrates the relevance of authenticity as a construct for understanding student perceptions of the factors motivating their curricular and career choices.

        "description":"This paper describes the process and procedures that three Rowan graduate students of school psychology, in collaboration with two faculty members, utilize to plan and deliver school psychology services. Overall, the cases show how school psychologists can influence the academic achievement of not only an individual child but also a whole class, as well as a whole system. Two cases illustrate the benefits of collaborative consultation while another describes the need to look at systematic variables (e.g., curriculum) and their impact on individual learners. The idea that psychologists need to act as consultants to schools as systems has gained much momentum within the past 10 years. The NASP position statement on advocacy for appropriate educational services for all children and  the subsequent publications, \"Alternative Educational Delivery Systems: Enhancing Instructional Options for All Students\" and \"Best Practices in School Psychology III,\" provide the philosophical and theoretical bases for an expanded role for school psychologists. New roles require that school psychologists provide expertise as appropriate to the various school-based services and programs. Changes in roles and behavior call for new ways of communicating information, planning, and decision making. As a consultant, the school psychologist is a resource within the natural learning environment, using curriculum-based educational and instructional methodologies to collaboratively identify problems and devise solutions. These cases indicate this approach is beneficial because it provides help at  the pre-referral stage, thus possibly preventing identifying children as disabled; it provides services for more students; and it makes full use of the professional capabilities of the educators involved, producing a multiplicative rather than an additive effect.

It also considers what can be learned about how people cope, and what available coping resources people have (including their coping thoughts and actions). Findings conclude that coping resources appear to be more predictive of burnout than coping processes; and having resources to draw upon in stressful situations appears to be negatively related to job burnout.

        "description":"This paper describes a program designed to increase students' social skill development in order to improve positive peer interactions. The target population was elementary school students in one middle-to-upper class, rural community in central Illinois. Evidence for the existence of the problem of inappropriate social behaviors that interfere with peer interactions and relationships was documented through teacher observations, parental contacts, behavior infractions, and student survey and interview data. Analysis of professional literature and site-based inappropriate social development in children suggests a variety of probable causes. Evidence surrounding the type of viewing material and accessibility of television provide one probable cause. The study finds that change in  family structure and the basic fiber of today's society, including parenting styles and role models, contributes to the lack of social skills in students. Teachers who resist social instruction in their classrooms are also a probable cause for this problem. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others, combined with analysis of the problem setting, resulted in a three-pronged intervention: a series of learning activities that address the targeted social skills, the use of literature-based and role play instruction, and learning activities that employ cooperative learning. Postintervention data indicate an increase in student use of cooperative strategies, an improvement in the targeted social skills areas, and an increase in the appropriate formation of interpersonal  relationships. Appendixes A-V provide activities used within the program; Appendix W is a bibliotherapy bibliography. (Contains 13 figures, 3 tables, and 35 references.) (Author/MKA)",

        "description":"This paper describes a program initiated by teacher-researchers to increase the use and knowledge of appropriate social skills with junior high school students while working in academic cooperative groups. The target groups comprised sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students in a predominantly middle class community in the Midwest. The students' lack of use or knowledge of the targeted social skills was documented through teacher observation, a teacher constructed pre-survey of the students, and teacher constructed rubrics used during academically challenging group assignments. Analysis of probable cause data indicates that students' lack of knowledge of the use of social skills is linked to changes in societal behaviors, changes in the family structure, and the lack of a caring  adult to model appropriate behaviors. Reviews of the curriculum at the targeted school revealed that social skills were being addressed in an Advisory Program, but were not being transformed to other areas of the school. A review of the solution strategies suggested by educational professionals and an analysis of the targeted junior high school setting resulted in the following intervention: directly teaching targeted social skills as part of the curriculum, allowing students time to reflect on the use of social skills through the use of journaling techniques, teacher modeling of the targeted social skills, and student practice of the targeted social skills during academically challenging group assignments. Results of the intervention support the researchers' hypothesis that such  intervention increases the use of the targeted skills in the classroom setting. It is noted that the students understood and used the targeted social skills in the classroom; they did not transfer their use to unstructured situations in the building.

The targeted population comprised seventh and ninth grade students in middle schools and high schools located in affluent suburban communities of a large Midwest city. The problem of moderate to high levels of stress was documented with teacher and student surveys, a stress level inventory, stress logs, and anecdotal records. Analysis of probable cause indicates a high level of stress among middle and high school students. This high level adversely affects various situations, including academic and social. Review of the research indicates that students are not introduced to coping skills in the school setting. A review of the solution strategies suggested by  other researchers, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the development of parent newsletters, teacher-led relaxation exercises, and implementation of a time and stress management program. The program includes lessons in role playing and problem solving, worksheets, and stress logs. Postintervention data indicates that students internalize coping techniques for stress. More research is necessary to determine whether improved academic achievement is a result of the intervention.

The targeted population comprised kindergarten and second grade students in a middle-class community located in central Illinois. The problem of inappropriate behaviors and difficulties interacting with peers and how this may affect academic achievement was documented through data collected by observation checklists, social skills inventories, student interviews, and teacher-made criterion-based reference tests. Analysis of probable cause data reveals that society, in general, is changing. Many factors affect children's social development, including negative media, dissolution of the family unit, lack of appropriate instruction, low socioeconomic status, and exposure to a  physically and socially toxic environment. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the selection of four major categories of intervention: explicitly teaching social skills to students, cooperative learning instruction and activities, peer mentoring between the second graders and kindergartners, and implementing multiple intelligence activities in the classroom. Post intervention data indicated an increase in prosocial behavior, a decrease in antisocial behavior, and enhanced academic performance.

The study finds that school counselors do recognize the importance of their role in crisis intervention; however, everyone, not just the school counselor, plays an important role in the intervention process. Results show a great need for crisis intervention at this time, and indicate that training must not be limited to school counselors and administrators.

A fundamental goal of beginning reading instruction should be to move each child toward the understanding that readers reconstruct texts by using multiple strategies to interpret the language encoded in print and, at the same time, to make it possible for the child to do this by providing information that will enable construction of appropriate strategies. It considers the ways a teacher can stimulate young children to read, such as using experience charts in class; using the Guided Listening Thinking activity to choose a library (picture) book to read; or using the shared book (Big Book) experience. According to the paper, phonics should not be taught for its own sake but rather  to assist learners to unlock unknown words. The paper suggests word banks for young readers and storybook time every day when the teacher reads orally to the pupils. The paper also recommends sustained silent reading as offering a positive model for reading. It cautions that the primary grade reading teacher needs to have all pupils experience initial successes with continual optimal progress emphasized for each child. (Contains 11 references.) (NKA)",

State-by-state results show that Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky, Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington were among the states that made statistically significant gains from 1994 to 1998. Many experts questioned suggestions that states with strong standards movements improved, noting that standards have not been in place long enough. Comparisons across states are also dangerous in that data cannot be used to suggest specific reading instruction strategies unless  the populations from state to state are homogeneous and similar in terms of numerous socioeconomic factors. Poverty has more to do with test scores than anything else. Urban high poverty states tend to do less well. Montana, which scored right behind Connecticut, has excellent public schools but also a stable student population that speaks English and comes from families tuned into the majority system of education. Although results of the NAEP are heartening, Americans have much to do in their quest to be a nation of educated people.

It gives two examples of how personalized units of reading instruction were used. The paper suggests giving pupils ample opportunities to choose and read a library book of personal choice. Suggesting the use of \"Big Books\" to be read and discussed together in the classroom, it lists 5 features that make for personalized reading with the Big Book approach. The paper lists 5 ways that the basal reading approach may become more personalized for pupils. Next, it mentions 5 things teachers need to consider when dealing with one-on-one instruction in the classroom. The paper concludes that pupils need to  become good readers so that a wholesome self-concept may evolve and utilitarian needs are met through reading proficiently in school and in society. (SC)",

Yet standardized tests are written to spread pupils out from the first to the 99th percentile, or from three or more standard deviations above to three or more standard deviations below the mean. Standardized tests have many weaknesses in describing a pupil's present level of reading achievement. The paper lists 10 weaknesses in standardized tests, followed by five remarks about student reading often seen in news accounts. The paper calls for a vision of &quot;what can be&quot; in a reading program--a vision that practitioners need to articulate to parents, people in the community, and others interested in educating children. It then delineates  this forward looking reading program, discussing metacognition skills, the learning environment, actively involved parents, personalized reading instruction, emphasis on the psychology of learning in teaching reading, and diagnosis and remediation in reading.

Knowledge of the emergent literacy research also framed and shaped the study. Participants were two kindergarten teachers and their students in a Midwestern affluent suburban school district in a state that does not require students to attend kindergarten. Both teachers taught in the same school and planned together. The morning kindergarten class had 23 children with one special needs student, while the afternoon kindergarten class had 21 children. Data were collected from October 1997 through April  1998. Results showed that literacy practices in the two classes were similar but limited; read aloud, centers, opening activities, and journal writing were the four most common literacy practices children were engaged in. There was little or no regular modeling of literacy activity by the teacher. Findings suggest the need for continued education of kindergarten teachers in the research related to emergent literacy and developmentally appropriate practice. (Contains 22 references.) (NKA)",

The guide provides information and ideas for designing projects and plans to impact literacy, and was developed to strengthen the  decision-making process for schools and districts. It provides a basic research base for making decisions in eight common areas of schoolwide planning. In outlining these eight common areas, the guide summarizes the criteria used by schools achieving high literacy levels and includes graphics which have been successfully used by other schoolwide planning teams.

Nowhere apparently has the concept of the whole been ignored more than in the teaching of reading. The &quot;see and say&quot; (holistic) approach, introduced in the early fifties, still dominates the classroom. Readers and workbooks present selected whole words as equal to or the same as the sum of its parts accompanied by colorful illustrations for memorizing by repetition in contexts. In contrast, the systemic approach recognizes the parts of the whole within the word and their relationships to speech sounds. By definition, a letter is a significant speech sound within a language system. Systemic reading programs expose another of the hidden &quot;greater&quot; parts of the  equation--word relationships within a statement. It may be that the holistic system fears that exposure of the hidden aspects of language will leave the learner forever processing words consciously sound by sound, syllable by syllable, or word by word. The systemic approach to the teaching of reading ensures that the learner becomes acquainted with the tools of the system and how to use them. And for the reader taught by both methods, their eyes and mind move across the printed page unhampered by information about how it all happens. (Contains definitions, a diagram, and a worksheet.)

The paper elaborates on some of the ways that humor can be used systematically by most college instructors.

        "description":"A study investigated software choices of graduate-level clinicians in a university reading clinic to determine computer use and effectiveness in literacy instruction. The clinic involved students of varying ability, ages 7-12, using 24 Power Macintosh computers equipped with &quot;ClarisWorks,&quot;&quot;Kid Pix,&quot;&quot;Student Writing Center,&quot; and &quot;Netscape Navigator&quot; software. Computer lab observations, examination of clinicians' lesson plans, and software evaluation forms showed that for computerized instruction: (1) follow-through was a lower priority; (2) time-on-task was less targeted; (3) computers were sometimes chosen for motivational value only; (4) software was used for drill and practice word recognition instruction, word processing, electronic books, Internet, and one-on-one  interaction; and (5) hardware use resulted in frustrations because of unfamiliarity and availability issues. Findings suggest: teachers were moderately technically competent, were eager to use computers, and needed more time to familiarize themselves and plan; skill and grade level of software needed to be pinpointed with a corresponding list; and motivational stimulation regarding computers should be carefully determined. (Contains 11 references and 2 figures of data; an appendix lists 61 software titles available at the clinic.) (EF)",

By \"starting early,\" it addresses the fact that the roots of reading take hold well before children go to school; and by \"finishing strong,\" it notes that schools alone cannot do the job of teaching children to read--parents must stay involved, the community must help, and nothing is more important than a highly skilled, well-prepared teacher. After an executive summary that discusses how to help every child become a reader, and an introduction that addresses the \"right kind of reading war,\" chapters in the book are: (1) Raising Readers:  The Tremendous Potential of Families; (2) Ready to Read: Building Skills through Early Care and Education; (3) Read to Succeed: How Schools Can Help Every Child Become a Reader; and (4) Every Child a Reader: How Citizens, Public Leaders, and Communities Can Help.

Noting that the structure of knowledge movement during the 1960s-1970s emphasized the selection of what is relevant and important to teach and that pupils learn ideas inductively, this paper suggests some enjoyable ways to have pupils learn key ideas in English as it relates to reading instruction. The paper states, that to emphasize the structure of knowledge approach in learning, the teacher should: have an excellent knowledge of major generalizations in sentence patterns; sequence learning opportunities in which individuals experience the enactive (objects and items), the iconic (semi-concrete materials of instruction), and  the symbolic (abstract ideas); appraise pupils to ascertain how many of these structural ideas are being attained by pupils in a spiral curriculum; and use enactive, iconic, and symbolic materials in inductive approaches to learning. The paper then focuses on a detailed discussion of sentence patterns, including procedures to use in evaluating pupil achievement pertaining to knowledge and skills in the structure or patterns of sentences. It concludes that teachers need to spend more time emphasizing to pupils how learning the structure of language is practical in reading and writing across the curriculum. (NKA)",

The paper states that there are selected principles of learning that all schools of psychology emphasize. It first enumerates and elaborates on five of these principles. Noting that there are specific schools of thought in the psychology of learning that principals need to understand to help their teachers in teaching pupils, the paper then discusses these diverse psychologies of learning, including (1) the measurement movement; (2) constructivism; and (3) pupil decision-making. The paper also considers the contributions of Jerome Bruner and Jean Piaget, two outstanding  educational psychologists.

        "description":"This paper records two different professors' thoughts and experiences as recipients of fellowships for school-university collaboration. The first recipient, after hearing about program models in education, is changing how he thinks about education and the possible mission of the university. In the paper, he explains that the collaborative project sought to promote attention in classrooms to the practices of responding to writing, both at those times when teachers respond to student work and when students respond to each other's work. Activities and discussions were planned that would immerse interested teachers in practices of substantive response and allow them collectively to compare the effectiveness of strategies for applying the practices of substantive response. According  to the paper, each professor was emboldened to experiment with new approaches to teaching. The second professor uses an &quot;open letter&quot; to his colleagues to describe in narrative form his feelings about teaching and how the fellowship has given him the opportunity to let some other people into the private space of teaching. A research proposal for research on professorial responses to student writing (with Dora Flores) is appended, as is an update on the project. (NKA)",

        "author":["Ratliff, Gerald Lee"],
        "description":"From the director's point of view, a &quot;memorable monologue&quot; is one in which the actor exhibits imagination and invention in role-playing. Memorable audition monologues require a measured degree of &quot;risk taking&quot; and uninhibited abandon--the first task is to select monologues that suit the type of script and the role being cast. This paper first gives 11 tips for performing memorable monologues, including: cultivate a natural and conversational delivery of dialogue; display personal habits or mannerisms that distinguish a character; &quot;tune&quot; the vocal instrument to produce sounds, syllables, and words crisply (practice relaxation exercises to free the voice); and focus on the &quot;tempo&quot; that underscores the present moment in the monologue. The paper then presents four additional  dimensions related to theater &quot;etiquette&quot; and four performance &quot;strategies&quot; to consider in the memorable audition blueprint. It concludes by stating that &quot;individuality&quot; is still the hallmark of performing memorable monologues, and audition choices should be appropriate and suitable in terms of self-image and professional range of skill or talent.

        "description":"A study applied an ethnography of speaking to the study of a bilingual child, with the construct of a frame as the unit of analysis. The child was observed and tape recorded playing a commercial game in Chinese with her mother and in English with her father. Both activity frames and conceptual frames were analyzed toward answering: (1) what frames were performed during game play; (2) how those frames differed between Chinese and English; (3) what conceptual frames were produced in languages spoken; and (4) how those conceptual frames differed between each language. In brief, an ethnographic perspective was applied toward describing how the organization of activity and language compared between both languages, through the play of a single game. Results indicated that each parent  enacted different roles with the daughter during the play of the game. Whereas the mother (with previous game experience) performed an expert-novice role during game play, the father (with lack of experience in game playing) took a novice-expert stance with the daughter. The activity frames and conceptual frames followed accordingly, with the games in Chinese dominated by frames featuring directing and reporting on the part of the mother, while the games in English had the daughter dominating talk with informing and reporting functions of frames. Findings suggest a tight relationship between utterance, its function, and its frame for embedding topic-relationships. This hints at dual activity-conceptual systems among bilingual children, warranting further attention by educators to  integrate three dimensions into language classroom instruction: grammar form, speech function, and conceptual contents. (Contains 12 figures, 33 tables, a 112-item bibliography, and function lists for the Chinese game and the English game). (Author/NKA)",

The influences of \"issue benefit,\"\"opinion congruence,\" and \"issue knowledge,\" as sources of benefits and costs on opinion expression were hypothesized and tested. The study also examined the interaction effects of those factors and the types of opinion expression. For the tests, 171 university students were surveyed in 1997 regarding their willingness to express opinions on the issue of \"doctor-assisted suicide.\" Results indicated that the amount of issue benefit expected by students was related to their willingness to express opinions; the level of students' perception of their own issue knowledge was influential on their  opinion expressions; and students' own judgments about the possible consequences of a given issue might function, against fear of isolation, as a motivating factor of opinion expression.

The paper is based upon a comparative analysis of the failings of the traditional teaching system and that of a new team-process approach, measured by survey and observation, that incorporated both quantitative and qualitative methodologies relevant to the demands of the media profession that were gathered from sources ranging from libraries, the Internet, and  interviews and reported in 36 oral presentations, a major written project, and a series of examinations.

Results indicated: (1) the majority of students who had taken a class in the three-weekend format at least four times were happy with the overall content; (2) students in the 30-39  year-old category viewed the three-weekend format more positively than did the older and younger students; and (3) there was a strong positive significant relationship between gender and academic performance, format, and class content with regard to the three-weekend curriculum format.

Yet despite the need for reporters and editors who can inject foresight into the news--and despite studies showing that the disciplined use of &quot;futures thinking&quot; not only can be a useful tool for journalists in a rapidly changing world, but a vital one--the use of futures studies in the teaching of journalism and mass communications is found to be an underused resource. The time is ripe for rethinking curricular change. Hendrickson and Tankard (1997), for example, are exploring classroom techniques for using general systems theory. According to their research &quot;Teaching future reporters to think of news events  and issues in systems terms may be one approach to expanding the news frame.&quot; (Contains 40 references; an appendix outlines a proposed course, &quot;Journalism and the Future.&quot;) (NKA)",

        "description":"The School of Communications at the University of Washington initiated the Journalism and Trauma program in 1994 so that all of its journalism graduates would be informed about trauma and would consider how to interview and write about victims without doing further harm to them. The program adapts learning objectives of the pioneer Victims and the Media program in the Michigan State University School of Journalism. During a workshop, students learn about trauma and its symptoms, practice interviewing actors playing people who may be experiencing trauma, and learn how to cope with their own stress. A study assessed the effectiveness of the trauma training program for recent journalism graduates to learn how many were exposed in some degree to traumatic events in their work; to  find out how the trauma training (if they received it) has helped graduates to be more effective journalists; and to ask for suggestions to improve the trauma program for future students. A survey questionnaire was mailed to 214 journalism graduates from the years 1994-1997. Of the 82 replies, those 42 graduates who worked in journalism were interviewed by telephone--14 had participated in the trauma training. Results indicated that all graduates see trauma training as a worthwhile exercise for journalism students, and that the majority of graduates had been exposed to traumatic incidents in their job assignments. Responses suggest the need for more professional support for the personal trauma journalists may experience. (Contains a figure and a 4-item bibliography.) (NKA)",

Subjects (84 undergraduate students) viewed one of two versions of the same Web site--one with multimedia and one without. The Web site consisted of six stories not heavily covered in the media from the categories of local news, national news (politics), international news, sports, health and human interest (people). Text and images on both sites were identical, except that on the plain site audio and/or video enhancements of the multimedia site were transcribed and placed in the same location in the story as on the multimedia site. This made it possible to determine the influence on  comprehension and recall of the presence or absence of the audio and/or video files. Dependent variables were comprehension, recall, or response to site. A post-test measured comprehension and recall. Findings did not support a significant difference in comprehension, recall, or response arising from presence or absence of multimedia. Comprehension and recall with regard to items such as current events knowledge, gender, and advertisements are also discussed.

A comprehensive curriculum, which explored the genre of drama and included a theater of the absurd component, was designed and was presented to the 15 students enrolled in an Advanced Placement English class. A curriculum unit was created for 12 works of drama which encompassed the categories of ancient Greek drama, Shakespearean drama, modern drama, and theater of the absurd. The unit included a historical perspective of the evolution of the genre of drama,  incorporated instruction on drama conventions and structure of each of the above categories, and involved the reading and critical analysis of an eclectic drama collection. Even though all outcomes were not achieved, analysis of the qualitative data revealed that educational intervention via a drama curriculum unit can greatly affect student academic evolution and growth and can more fully prepare Advanced Placement English literature students.

        "description":"A survey of high school journalism teachers attending the Florida Scholastic Press Association convention found that 75% had access to the Internet at home and 56% had access to the Internet at school. Surveys and cover letters were distributed to the 120 advisers attending the 1997 convention; 39 advisers completed the survey for a response rate of 32%. More than half of the respondents said they would take courses for certification or recertification credit if offered via distance learning. The teachers' main concerns about distance learning courses were the time involved in taking the course and the cost of the course. (Contains 16 references, a figure, and a sample survey.)

Improvisational playmaking by students, using literature in the form of plays, prose, and poetry, forms the basis of Reader's Theatre. Use of Reader's Theatre in the classroom can: (1) foster deeper understanding of character, setting, and plot through the reading, interpretation, and experience of dramatic performance; (2) create deeper understanding of content and a sense of identity and personal validation by making students responsible for their own learning; and (3) encourage better interpersonal interaction through the body language, voice control, and empathy inherent in the group acting experience. Results suggest that the program develops classroom energy and  student/teacher motivation by engaging children in holistic involvement with literature and encouraging students to discover, ask questions, role play, and thus achieve a sense of belonging.

        "description":"Eliciting creativity in every student in the classroom can be a realistic goal for classroom teachers. The teaching of creativity embraces form and structure as well as freedom of thought and expression. It is very appropriate to provide the student with an imaginative and creative impetus with which he/she cannot only create or establish the frame for his/her own life, but supply the tools for the painting of the picture of life. Spontaneous art can be used to activate the imagination--there are no rules and there is no instruction. Risk-taking is a very important factor in order to develop cognitive skills. Divergent thinking skills, where the child can develop different avenues of learning, becomes a supportive factor in teaching the creative child. Creative drama in the  classroom can be a useful tool in developing creativity and imagination. Visualizing and imaging are used almost simultaneously while various exercises are used. The difficulty, however, of allowing the creative mind to grow and develop in a world where values are very linear has posed problems for years. The paradox lies somewhere in the process where the rules are so strict that children replace their creativity for social acceptance. (Contains 14 references.) (NKA)",

The text outlines ways that accountability systems motivate teachers, and describes the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation systems. The digest emphasizes the need for school leaders to understand what motivates their staff when assembling an accountability system. Various systems are in operation in states and school districts, and the paper discusses the effectiveness of new accountability systems  throughout the U.S. Although 48 states now test their students, only 19 publicly rate school performance, and just 14 provide monetary incentives for good performance. Accountability systems can also create some troubling issues, such as teachers narrowing their efforts to focus on test preparation. Ways in which schools can meet new accountability expectations include monitoring vital indicators, aligning professional development with improvement goals, and developing a positive mind set. The digest closes with a list of what school leaders can do, such as promoting a safe and orderly school environment, to ensure that an accountability plan will succeed. (Contains 12 references.)

It presents studies of two distinct educational reforms--a local community-based collaborative-services initiative and a state educational-accountability program--to illustrate important organizational features that vary across school levels. Both reforms are examined in light of the organizational features of schools attempting to implement the changes. Although the two reforms are distinct from each other, both suggest possible organizational explanations for differential reform implementation by grade level. The report is based on two studies--one a qualitative study, the other a large-scale survey--that explore the unique features of elementary, middle, and high schools in the  face of reform implementation. The data included interviews with over 30 personnel from schools, social services and public health and law-enforcement agencies, and observations from governance committee meetings, school-team meetings, and community-based services meetings. Schools that successfully adopt the reforms share some common characteristics that relate to organizational culture and structure. Reform was much more successfully implemented in elementary schools, and results suggest that it is because they are more tightly coupled organizations than secondary schools.

It opens by defining power and explains that traditional organizational hierarchical structures tend to motivate people to use power in self-protective ways. It claims that for empowerment to work, leaders must help people use their power creatively and collaboratively for good. The article examines pitfalls in implementing an empowerment agenda, such as announcing a new philosophy and then doing nothing to implement it, and shares some precautions that need to be taken when empowering teachers through shared decision-making. Teachers' decisions should carry some relevance for them, and administrators must avoid giving teachers responsibility for a decision with no  corresponding power to implement the decision. Leaders should address their own fears and assume that most people, when empowered, will invest more of themselves and function at a higher, more creative level. The paper lists the three keys to empowerment: share information with everyone, replace old hierarchies with self-directed teams, and create autonomy through boundaries. It also outlines the six dimensions of teacher empowerment: shared decision making, teacher professional development, teacher status, teacher self-efficacy, teacher autonomy, and teacher impact.

It describes how Goals 2000 and/or Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF) grants are being used to start, support, and/or sustain these reforms. The report examines the nine subgrantees' reform efforts using a multiple case-study approach and addresses the following research questions, grouped into four main categories: (1) What reform efforts have the subgrantees implemented to improve teaching and learning in their districts and how have Goals 2000 and/or TLCF funds sustained these efforts; (2) What evidence suggests that the reform efforts have been successful; (3) How and to what extent do these subgrantees coordinate program funds to promote reform; and (4) What  do these case studies tell policymakers about the planning and implementation of successful programs? The findings show that subgrantees implemented several reform efforts to improve teaching and learning, such as the adoption/creation and implementation of state and local standards and curricula. Successes were evident through state and local assessment scores and improvements in professional development. The flexible nature of Goals 2000 subgrants enabled districts to spend the funds on their priorities. Finally, several policy issues emerged, including the finding that districts play a significant role in implementing systemic standards-based reform. (RJM)",

The guide outlines the elements of CAROI, its design, characteristics, and principles (including communication, collaboration, and trust). It describes  how CAROI works and presents this program as a responsive process. CAROI can also function as a proactive process, and the text outlines prevention techniques for potential audit findings. How CAROI can be applied to other government agencies, some of the challenges of using the initiative, and how CAROI teams can help others to get started in the process are all explored.

The report analyzes two state-administered systems (Kentucky and Maryland), two locally developed systems (San Francisco and Chicago), and one large urban district responding to the state-based accountability requirements (New York City). Five major findings regarding the identification and support of low-performing schools in these jurisdictions emerged: (1) most low-performing schools identified by state or  local accountability systems are Title I schools; (2) considerable overlap exists between the schools identified for improvement under Title I and those identified in the jurisdictional systems; (3) where there is no overlap, the discrepancy stems primarily from differences in the criteria used for identification; (4) the lack of specified consequences for Title I schools that fail to improve contributes to a relatively low saliency for Title accountability in these jurisdictions; and (5) support provided to low-performing schools (identified by either Title I or jurisdictional accountability systems) varies substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

The evaluation involved both formative and summative evaluations and used both qualitative and quantitative methods. The study was conducted between October 1997 and December 1998. Data-collection methods included a charter-school survey and a school-climate survey administered to PSA staff, students, and parents; interviews with representatives of all stakeholder groups; demographic data, financial data, and test scores; and documents, literature, school portfolios, and student work samples. Findings show that the number of PSAs operating in the state rose from 38 in 1995-96 to 137 in the 1998-99 school year. PSAs were small in terms of size with the trend toward more  management companies starting or running the PSAs. The findings show that there are four distinct groups of charter schools in Michigan: converted private schools, converted public schools, &quot;mom and pop&quot; schools, and &quot;franchise&quot; or &quot;cookie cutter&quot; schools. Governance and leadership issues of the schools are described, as are curriculums and quality of instruction, financial status of the schools, teachers and staff in PSAs, working conditions and staff satisfaction, students and parents, PSA legislation, authorizing agencies, management companies, and other information.

The report describes how charter schools are becoming increasingly popular throughout the U.S. and how states are meeting demand for these schools. It looks at open enrollment, which allows parents to choose where their children receive their education, and provides a brief history of this practice. An overview of homeschooling includes the racial  composition of homeschoolers and the number of homeschooled students. The report discusses voucher programs, which enable parents to send their children to any school of their choice, and outlines why this practice is so controversial.

Among the findings, schools reported a need for 484.63 administrators, 9,204.75  additional teachers, and 3,302.43 more classified positions to maintain current levels of service. To maintain current services, districts reported it would cost over $18 million; the implementation of anticipated improvement would cost over $24 million. Also, all school districts reported that the class-size reduction program displaced other programs. The report discusses the need for emergency permits, for additional classrooms, the availability of sites for school construction, child development and child care, and joint-use facilities. An appendix provides more information on displaced programs and other needs. The survey instrument appears at the back. (RJM)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes current court cases that address the relationships among church, state, and education, describing how government and religion have been intertwined through most of history. With the rise of democracies, however, and the recognition of abuses perpetrated by religio-government alliances, the separation of church and state became popular. This separation has now come into question with the rise of the school privatization movement and competition among schools. The increasing influence of private schools, vouchers, and individual choice has led to extensive litigation. Key cases involve the protection of privately funded religious education, the practice of religion in public schools, and the denial of religious instruction in public schools. The paper then  covers current court cases in Wisconsin, Ohio, Vermont, Maine, Arizona, and other states. Often obscured by fine legalistic distinctions, the fundamental question remains whether education is for the common good or for individual good. (Contains 29 references.) (RJM)",

The report is organized by the following three areas: (1) background on Colorado's size factor, including a description of the formula, a summary of changes in the factor over time, and a comparison with similar factors in other states; (2) a review of the actual factors and the funding that is driven by the factors in Fiscal Year 1999-00; and (3) a review of research and literature on economies of scale in general. The report focuses on changes to the size factor under the School Finance Act and offers a synopsis of 10 states that incorporated a  size factor in their school-finance formulas. It shows how measures of economies of scale were taken and what the impact of the size factor on per-pupil funding would be. The findings reveal that in Fiscal Year 1998-99, the size factor contributed $121 million toward total programs, or nearly 4 percent of the total funding provided through Colorado's School Finance Act. Districts with the fewest pupils received the largest size factor. On average, the size factor added $186 to per-pupil funding.

It outlines recommendations for improving equal opportunity through equitable distribution of resources. The document, prepared by the Essential Programs and Service Committee of Maine's State Board of Education, addresses the Legislature's charge to develop a plan for funding essential programs and services, specifically the 1995 Learning Results program. The committee began its work in 1996 and examined information on current practices in Maine's schools, collected evidence from existing or proposed models, reviewed the national literature on school resources and performance, and called for expert testimony from persons who had special knowledge of equity funding. Key  components of the committee's recommendations were that most of the funding identified should be made available without any requirements regarding how the funds are spent, and that this decision be left to the local school districts. With three exceptions--early childhood development, technology, and student assessments--the committee did not prescribe how resources should be used at the local level. The committee recommended that accountability be built into the funding system. (Eight appendices offer information on committee membership and other matters. Contains 114 references.) (RJM)",

It outlines an organizational inventory to determine each school's health profile and examines whether teachers' opinions of the organizational health of their schools are affected by teachers' gender, branch, job experience, working years at the same schools, and level of education. Following a pilot study, an organizational health inventory was developed across five dimensions: organizational leadership, organizational integrity, environmental interaction, organizational identity, and organizational product. The inventory was then distributed to 810 teachers and administrators; 485 questionnaires were returned and used for data analysis. The  results revealed a significant difference between the opinions of teachers and administrators as they relate to organizational leadership, organizational integrity, internal and external interaction, and organizational products. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups on organizational identity. An important finding was the difference in opinions regarding organizational health. It suggests that administrators can look at the organizational health profile of their schools to obtain clues on problems and matters requiring change. It is recommended that schools with low health scores develop improvement plans. (Contains 26 references.) (RJM)",

It comments on procedural, legal, and equity considerations; reviews several studies of SBB implementation in urban districts; and identifies emerging policy and research directions. The rationale behind SBB includes the finding that decentralizing four key resources (power, information, knowledge, and rewards) can enhance organizational effectiveness and productivity. Some of the implementations and obstacles to SBB include the time involved, fairness issues, and the need to enhance equity among schools. Recent studies paint a complex picture of SBB's promise and pitfalls. Some districts had a &quot;broadened definition&quot; of SBB and a high-involvement orientation,  and some power was decentralized, but district and state constraints allowed schools little discretionary authority. However, a study of Chicago Public Schools showed that they achieved at least one reform goal--the reallocating of funds to reduce administrative bureaucracy and equalize interschool finance. Even so, other studies demonstrated that SBB provided no impetus for schools to do business differently and equity remained a problem. The digest suggests that clarity is needed about SBB's purpose and goal, and it cautions that only a weak link between SBB and school-based management has been found. (Includes 14 references.)

Compacts were examined to determine who was responsible for student progress and other issues. Five compacts from the most promising schools were selected. The  results show that all five schools adopted a broad definition of the school-parent compact as one part of a comprehensive partnership between schools and families. Stakeholders in all five schools reported an active, inclusive development process, and they measured success in how the compacts were used--each school tried varied strategies to keep the compact visible and on the agenda, which proved a difficult challenge for stakeholders. Finally the schools' stakeholders viewed their compacts as a &quot;work in progress&quot; and planned for early and regular evaluation. (RJM)",

The publication looks at various programs that serve the broad educational priorities set forth in the Department of Education's Strategic Plan. The findings are grouped around a series of 11 questions such as the following: How well are students doing? Are federal regulation programs helping to prepare children for school? Are federal programs helping states develop and implement standards? Are federal programs contributing to greater choice in public schools?  Are federal laws promoting flexibility and accountability for results? The report concludes that reform is headed in the  right direction, though states are still in the process of implementing reforms. Even though federal programs supported and stimulated state-based reform and states have made significant progress in developing content standards, progress is considerably slower with respect to developing performance standards and aligned assessments. Based on the lack of evidence of when states have benchmarked standards against outside criteria, there is variability in the rigor of standards. The findings suggest that the reform efforts are producing changes in classrooms, with students making significant progress since the 1994 reauthorization. (RJM)",

It also examines the role of Title I in holding schools accountable for results; the use of Title I funds; and the allocation and use of resources in states, districts, and schools. Findings show that improved achievement is being seen among students in high-poverty schools and among low-performing students. Since 1992, national reading performance has  improved for 9-year-olds in the highest-poverty public schools. Among the lowest-achieving, public school fourth-graders--those most likely to be served by Title I--there were fairly substantial improvements in reading between 1994 and 1998. Math achievement has also improved nationally, especially among students in the highest-poverty public schools, yet a substantial achievement gap still remains between students in the highest- and lowest-poverty schools.

        "description":"This instructor's edition provides an overview of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). PBL organizes students into teams that work on projects to achieve the learning objectives embedded in each PBL project. The focus of this PBL project is managing technological change. The project is structured around a high-impact problem--one that has the potential to affect large numbers of people--that administrators are likely to face. The guide discusses how instructors might set the stage for the project, foreshadows issues that might arise during the project, and suggests possible topics that the instructor might raise when giving feedback to students. The booklet guides participants through critical issues relevant to information technology in schools so as to prepare students for sustaining  long-term technology initiatives in schools. It discusses challenges facing schools, challenges in implementing PBLP, learning objectives, products, and guiding questions. The text deals not only with issues such as staff resistance and budgetary constraints, but also explores new models for using technology in schools, implications of technology for instruction and learning, technology's role in restructuring, and the development of a long-term technology plan that takes into account the needs of students, teachers, and parents. Four appendices offer further information. (RJM)",

The FSS is an 18-item questionnaire that measures the amount of perceived support given to the parents of young children with disabilities. Items generally consist of persons or agencies from which respondents could potentially receive emotional support. The FRS is a 30-item questionnaire that measures the adequacy of time and economic resources for families with small children. Items generally consist of objects and persons for which one would need time or monetary resources. The study used data from the Early Intervention Research Institute's longitudinal studies,  which consist of 992 children and their families who were or are participating in a variety of different types of intervention programs. Results indicate that both of these measures were strengthened by proposed new scoring strategies. Both of the measures showed reasonably high internal consistency reliability coefficients, with reliability coefficients at least as high as those computed by the test's authors. However, the study found that FRS suffered from too many items that drew a limited response. (Contains 26 references and 14 tables.) (CR)",

The Accelerated Reader program is a computer-based reading management system that includes a database of thousands of books ranging in reading levels from one to twelve. Students earn points to be redeemed for prizes or other incentives as they read books and pass a comprehension test on each book. The study involved four classes of middle school students with learning disabilities and the control group, which was made up of two classes that did not use Accelerated Reader. Students in the treatment group increased reading levels from a mean score of 2.81 to 3.50 on  the Standardized Test for Assessment of Reading (STAR). These students improved attitudes by 13 percent on the Estes Reading Attitude Scale. Students in the control group decreased reading levels from 4.75 to 4.25 on the STAR test and improved attitudes by only 2.6 percent on the Estes instrument.

The software was created for one student with moderate mental retardation to enable him to practice reading, writing, and reciting personal information. The program, \"Your Personal Information,\" was created with an authoring program called Macromedia Director. The program provided the student with text, full on-demand audio support, multiple choice questions, and a practice-by-memory option. The authored lesson consisted of several screens of information: a title screen that included the goal and objectives of the lesson, five screens that used a consistent design to present the student's address, date of birth,  phone number, social security number, and school lunch number, five screens each with a multiple choice question, and one screen for a practice-by-memory option. In addition, several screens of feedback or remediation were available. The program also included real pictures associated with the student's life to support the information on-screen. The student responded favorably to the program, and the individualized nature of the computer program enhanced student motivation and resulted in improved ability to read, write, and recite personal information.

The plan suggests these courses of action: (1) survey records, bulldoze through a massive pile of files, and excavate previous summaries of behavioral incident reports; (2) develop a solid foundation by summarizing all incident reports; (3) build the first wall by creating a summary report of incidents for an annual report; (4) build the second wall by summarizing medication use; (5) build the  third wall by providing psychological evaluations and adaptive behavioral reports; (6) build the final wall by creating Behavior Strategy Plans; (7) create roof trusses by providing an ongoing system of data collection; and (8) provide a roof by designing a training course for staff that will raise consciousness of how one's own behavior can affect the behavior of another.

The paper notes that both PBS and FA differ from traditional behavioral management in focusing on systems, settings, and lack of skill. The 1997 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires or strongly recommends PBS and FA strategies. Research findings on the use of PBS demonstrate the method's wide applicability and effectiveness (it reduces problem behavior by 80 percent in two-thirds of cases). Classroom techniques to support positive behaviors include altering environments when useful, explicitly teaching new skills, and genuinely appreciating positive behaviors.  Implementation of the PBS model on a school-wide basis focuses on providing school-wide support, specific setting support, classroom support, and individual student support. School-wide strategies might include a set of positively stated expectations for behavior and a continuum of procedures for discouraging violations. Research on the use of FA with young children suggests that environmental manipulations such as increased teacher praise and reinforcement for appropriate behavior improved student behaviors. The paper concludes with a short list of positive supports to be used when addressing challenging behaviors. (DB)",

While 42 percent of the teachers reported that they currently work with gifted students, few shared their reasons. More teachers discussed why they had not become teachers of gifted students. Two themes related to social reasons and two related to personal reasons. Social reasons related to lack of administrative support and lack of gifted education programs. Personal reasons related to lack of interest and their teaching philosophy (i.e., the belief that all children are gifted). Likewise, the minority teachers identified social and personal reasons for becoming teachers of gifted students. Some teachers also  shared how their experiences with special education students influenced their vocational choice. For instance, several teachers shared concerns regarding negative experiences in special education, as well as experience in working with gifted students with special needs. Social or external reasons for becoming teachers of gifted students included support and encouragement from colleagues and administration. Personal reasons included an interest in gifted students, primarily from curiosity, and a determination to demonstrate that minority teachers can be competent gifted education teachers.

Video segments captioned at different speeds were shown to 1,102 subjects (aged 11-95) with and without hearing impairments, and the subjects then responded to test items based on the captions in the videos. The caption speeds ranged from 80 words-per-minute (wpm) to 220 wpm. One set of test items was based directly on facts given in the captions. Another set of items was based on inferences that could be made from caption information. Overall, there was no significant relationship between test scores and caption speed. Test scores were compared over various demographic categories. The study did not find a meaningful relationship  between age and mean test scores. The mean test scores of females equaled or exceeded the mean test scores of males at all caption speed levels. Subjects who were junior high school students remembered facts as well as the other subjects did, but seemed less able to draw conclusions based on such facts. Overall, nonstudents tended to have slightly higher mean scores than students.

        "description":"This paper discusses the outcomes of a survey of 39 special education practitioners (including 24 school psychologists) and 280 elementary classroom teachers on the identification of students with reading disabilities. Practitioners were asked to rate five empirically valid and five clinical-traditional non-valid student traits for their significance as predictors of reading disability and, if judged to be a separable condition, dyslexia. Among the first group, nearly half chose to make this classification distinction; and for the teacher group, this percentage was even greater (80 percent). Analysis of raters' trait \"correctness\" scores did reveal a relatively higher degree of trait validity awareness for the prediction of reading disability versus dyslexia. In general, however,  these scores were not impressively higher, nor did they vary with respect to grade level taught or years of practitioner experience. Results of the survey, which  are interpreted to indicate the continuing, pervasive influence of clinical tradition and folk belief about the nature of reading problems, have important implications for referral allocation, Program eligibility, and Program goal setting. The survey is attached. (Contains 10 references.) (Author/CR)",

The task force recommended the development of certification standards and the promotion of these standards to the states. Since that time, 11 states have developed and implemented standards.

The targeted population consisted of six elementary students of a large, Midwestern, mainly middle-class community. The problems of skill retention were noted through teacher/parent conferences, surveys, and testing. The results of the intervention found increasing repetition of learned skills at school without parent involvement did not improve students' retention; however, increasing repetition of learned skills at school along with parental involvement did improve students' retention. To expand parent involvement, phone calls  were found to be more effective than sending notes because notes became lost, directions misunderstood, and parents had no immediate way to ask questions. Keeping in contact with the families on a regular basis also appeared to improve schoolwork along with behavior. Appendices include assessment materials. (Contains 14 references.) (CR)",

Participants came from the rehabilitation community (consumers, consumer advocates, community rehabilitation program staff, and vocational rehabilitation staff) and other community programs. The report discusses the various issues from the perspectives of persons with disabilities and the responses by community rehabilitation programs. The study found consensus among participants that the intent of the reforms was on target for addressing certain  deficits within employment and welfare programs for populations without disabilities. With regard to servicing people with disabilities, however, significant problems in implementation of the programs were consistently cited. Successful implementation of the reforms appeared to be dependent on how well local communities worked together to implement these programs and how much state and federal planners allowed communities the flexibility needed to serve different consumers with various needs.

Results of the study found that severe and/or high cost students are not randomly distributed throughout the state. As the basis for adjusting the funding formula accordingly, a &quot;severity service multiplier&quot; was created for each SELPA based on the characteristics and services received by special education students residing in their attendance areas. This index indicates SELPAs with responsibilities for disproportionate numbers of severe and/or high cost  students. Supplemental funding allowances were calculated for some SELPAs based on their severity service multiplier in relation to the state average, their overall average daily attendance funded rate, their total average daily attendance count, and other factors. Based on this analysis, it is estimated that the cost of fully implementing the severity service multiplier in the first year would be approximately $57 million. This cost estimate would represent supplemental state special education funding in the first year of about 1.5 percent. (Contains 18 references and 22 appendixes of research data.) (CR)",

The following steps are outlined for creating or revising a gifted education program: (1) read relevant textbooks to get a feel for gifted education; (2) designate a committee; (3) identify a philosophy or mission statement; (4) describe the rationale; (5) list program goals; (6) define giftedness; (7) design a method of identification based on the definition; and (8) create programs to meet the needs of those students identified. The paper then describes a gifted education program developed for Grantsburg Elementary School in Grantsburg, Wisconsin. The program is intended  to help all students reach their full potential, increase the over-all academic and intellectual strength of the school system, recognize the importance of thought in the development of humankind's advancement in the world, and promote a climate of excellence. The program is organized around the following four areas: creativity and intelligence, specific academic areas, the visual and performing arts, and leadership.

While it was initially thought that Mississippi's referral to placement process required for gifted education services might be a barrier to identification of students with disabilities, the opposite was found to be true. Results of the project indicate that Mississippi's polices pertaining to gifted education are not restrictive. Each district that identified students who were twice-exceptional did so according to state department guidelines. State regulations for gifted education programs outline minimal  criteria for eligibility, however, local districts have the authority to make many decisions concerning the referral to placement process for students within their schools. Furthermore, identification of the disadvantaged student is provided for in several areas throughout the regulations. Lack of knowledge, from the state department level downward, appeared to the principle reason that students who are twice-exceptional are under-identified in the state of Mississippi. Teacher training on the characteristics of students who are twice-exceptional is recommended. (Contains 32 references.) (CR)",

This paper describes each college, summarizes the range of courses offered and the way the colleges were organized, and the range of teaching and non-teaching accommodations available to the colleges and how this met their requirements. Among the main conclusions was that non-teaching accommodations are not always adequately provided for, particularly at institutions re-using existing premises. Also, teaching accommodation can be significantly increased by specific organizational changes. Finally, it was predicted that by 1984, the 16-19 year-old population would start to  decline following its peak in the 1981-82 academic year. Such decline of demand should allow scope both for rectifying deficiencies in non-teaching accommodation, and for the disposal of substandard or temporary teaching accommodation. Capital expenditure planning should strike a balance between short and longer term demand expectations. An appendix provides floor plans for two of the colleges. (GR)",

The Secretary urges Congress to act on school modernization. He discusses the emerging focus of architecture that now creates schools as community learning centers and the benefits of bringing the entire community into the process of school design. The Secretary argues for building smaller schools to help foster educational and operational efficiencies and presents a few ideas for accomplishing this goal. He further argues that smaller schools can help parents become more involved in their schools, can effect residential growth patterns and impact suburban sprawl, and can provide the catalyst for  bringing a community together in reviving a neighborhood. Further argued is the concept of building new schools that are multi-purpose in nature in order to bring the school closer to a community. Finally, the Secretary stresses the importance of linking schools to other learning centers such as museums, businesses, and environmental centers in order to enhance the learning experience. (GR)",

The purpose is to question assumptions underlying two claims currently being made about school architectural design. The first claim is that the space of the school needs to be more democratic, like a community, and the second is that the space of the school has become more oppressive and controlling. Common school design discourses in the United States incorporated some disciplinary aspects of British monitorial schools. However, in the 1800s, common school discourses governmentalized the \"American\" school-house with the aim of  self-government. Four historical junctures in discourses of school architecture are identified that provide the contingent conditions and reasonings upon which the current debates about reform of school design seem reasonable and make sense.

ELPA provides partial support for programs for limited-English-proficient elementary and secondary school students for a maximum of 2 years per student. It is noted that while the number of students eligible for the ELPA program has quadrupled from 1981 to 1996, funding was reduced for the 1996-97 school year. The program served 22,255 students during that year, primarily students whose dominant language was not English. About two-thirds of participating students showed a gain in English proficiency test scores. School districts rated themselves on the effectiveness of their programs in English as a Second Language (ESL), bilingual education, tutorial and individual  assistance, and other program types. Perceived areas of strength include ESL staffing, student instruction, program management, and individualized instruction. Problems encountered included funding, staffing issues, and the restrictiveness of state requirements. Major recommendations include increasing financial support to teach students English, increasing the student eligibility period, and continuing funding until the student achieves the state-recommended proficiency level.

        "description":"A study investigated the degree to which the pronunciation of English words in the child's home environment affected the acquisition or discrimination of phonological and orthographic correspondences of standard written English. Subjects were low-socioeconomic-status, inner-city African American kindergarten, first-, and second-grade students, who were given individually administered, standard phonological awareness tasks in class, including rhyming tasks. It was predicted that the children would perform better on recognition than production tasks, would perform better on recognition tasks where the reduction rule did not apply, and would select a response consistent with their vernacular, and that rhyming tasks would be the best predictors of future performance on standard  measures. Results suggest that two factors affect the amount of processing beginning readers must expend to be successful: the cognitive demands of the tasks used to measure phonological awareness, and the knowledge representation of one's oral phonological knowledge. It is concluded that children need to understand the differences between vernacular and standard English because vernaculars can affect the way children score on standard measures of reading.

Factors discussed include the perception that virtually all residents speak English and that children who don't speak English fluently, generally Hispanics, will have left the area before learning enough to function in mainstream classes; the state mandate for English-only instruction; and a generally hostile environment for LEP residents. Common responses to LEP students appear to be either classification as disabled students, perception as untenable expenses, and relegation to language laboratories to &quot;correct&quot; their language problems. LEP students are often lacking in self-confidence, are mocked by  native English-speaking peers, and must become language brokers for their families. Suggestions made for ameliorating the situation include acknowledgement of the LEP population and teacher education in support of bilingual teachers and bilingual education. Contains 10 references.

Subjects were 70 Latino students designated as limited-English-proficient (LEP) and placed in the freshman core English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) program in their freshman year. Most had been in the United States for less than 2 years. The students were followed from their freshman year through the end of their high school experience, with data collected through observation on and off campus, formal and informal interviews with students and staff, and case studies of six of the students. Findings are presented concerning the students' language choice and ethnic identity, the presence of unofficial ESL\"tracking\" at the school, student perceptions of mainstreaming, characteristics and training of the school staff, students' legal status, and graduation rate. Excerpts from student statements are included. Some conclusions are drawn concerning peer relationships, language choice, student placement, the school's priorities for this group, and the effect of students' legal status on their schooling and retention. Several recommendations are made concerning ESL programs, concerning students' legal status, and further research. Contains 11 references. (MSE)",

The writing portion of the test consists of two short essays, each scored by two native speakers of North American English, using a six-point rubric. In addition to giving the essay points, the first reader of each essay may select four comments from a standardized list concerning the essay's fluency and development, organization, vocabulary, and language elements. Mechanics and spelling are not addressed. Raters are trained to look for meaning in the work and to see past mechanical problems in the writing. Rater comments are to provide (1) praise and (2)  suggestions for improvement. Examples of comments in each area are included. Advantages of this approach include the time saved by teachers in providing a comment by number, and the ease with which standardized comments can be understood by students. Contains one reference.

        "description":"A discussion of bilingualism, biliteracy, and the educational context of Sub-Saharan Africa has three areas of focus. The first is the argument that the school environment is a complex one for bilingual education, biliteracy, and socialization generally in this multiethnic area, and that ideology and literacy issues feed language politics at several levels in the region. The second is that in spite of institutional efforts, only functionally limited bilingualism is available to many people, due to differences in public practice and private desires. In addition to external pressures such as flow of capital and popular culture, which have their preferred languages, issues such as minority status, language status, social attitudes, and cultural values are factors in the development  of bilingual identity, and explain why biliteracy does not always accompany bilingualism. The third argument is for a program of school bilingualism geared toward creating a responsible citizenry rather than developing bilingualism as an end in itself. Contains 46 references. (MSE)",

Successful implementation of SSR has several elements: access to books; appealing choice of books; quiet, comfortable surroundings conducive to pleasurable reading; encouragement, including teacher modeling; regular time set aside for reading; and lack of requirements for book reports, logs, or oral retelling that could inhibit student motivation.

Subjects were 203 students who took the test in August 1994 and completed a questionnaire about their learning experiences. The test consisted of three sections: language structure; video-essay; and pronunciation. Statistical analysis of test results and student information revealed that native language was more influential on test performance than learning experience. Language groups differed in both the pronunciation and video-essay sections, whereas learning-experience groupings differed only in the video-essay section. Neither grouping showed  statistically significant differences on the structure section, but native language groupings did perform differentially, although not to statistical significance. Results suggest that test-takers' native languages should be given more weight than learning experience in placing students into appropriate English-as-a-Second-Language classes if variables other than English language proficiency are considered in placement.

Specifically, it looked at performance on a midterm listening comprehension question in which students listened to self-introductory speeches of three job applicants and determined which was the most appropriate candidate for the job, based on content and pragmatic meaning. Focus was on students' judgment of the statements' pragmatic features, particularly degree of politeness. Subjects were 120 college students in 12 second-year class sections taught by eight teachers. The students overwhelmingly chose the applicant who satisfied explicit qualifications, even though the other two applicants  used more polite speech, considered an important qualification in Japanese culture. All instructors were surprised by the findings; all would have rejected the applicant the students chose, based on inappropriate use of Japanese pragmatic features. Aspects of classroom instruction that may contribute to students' misunderstanding of these pragmatic features are discussed. Contains 20 references. (MSE)",

A sample of 30 students enrolled in 2 freshman composition classes at a medium-sized Midwestern university completed a 74-item inventory measuring student writing approaches. Following administration of the inventory, 13 students with the highest scores were selected for semi-structured interviews. Five types of student writing approaches were identified: (1) elaborative, which views writing as deeply personal and marked by a search for personal meaning; (2) low self-efficacy, a highly fearful approach based on doubting ability and thinking about writing as a painful task; (3) reflective-revisionist, which describes a writing orientation based on a  sophisticated understanding of the revision process; (4) spontaneous-impulsive, which profiles an impulsive, unplanned approach; and (5) the procedural approach, a method-driven strategy based on strict adherence to rules and minimal involvement. The report concludes that an understanding of student perceptions about their writing is important to helping them gain a positive identity in writing as a precursor to acquiring increased skills.

        "description":"This study investigated 10-year trends of first-time-in-college (FTIC) and community college applicants to major public institutions in Florida, focusing on how an institution's geographic location affected applicant enrollment patterns. The investigation also examined the influence of geographic location on applicants applying to a single institution compared to those applying to multiple institutions. Data were obtained from Florida State University System master admissions files for the 1987, 1990, 1994, 1995, and 1996 cohorts of Florida applicants to the University of South Florida (USF), the University of Florida (UF), Florida State University (FSU), the University of Central Florida (UCF), and Florida Atlantic University (FAU). It was found that all applicants showed clear  preferences for institutions from their home region and particularly their home county. In addition, the study showed that the steadily dropping applicant yields over the period resulted largely from increasing numbers of applicants applying to multiple institutions. This proved true even for institutions with state-wide missions, such as UF and FSU. It was also found that FTIC applicants were far more likely than community college applicants to apply to multiple institutions, and that location was more important to community college applicants than to FTIC applicants.

        "description":"This paper provides an overview and analysis of the practice of tuition discounting by higher education institutions, especially private institutions. It explains that tuition discounting the practice of permitting some students to pay less than full tuition has risen markedly in recent years, and that there is significant confusion regarding the practice due to the reluctance of higher education officials to talk openly about finances and because different groups within higher education use different definitions of the term for different purposes. The paper discusses the differences between simple tuition discounts, scholarship allowances, student tuition discounts, and gross and net tuition revenues, noting that these terms are used by different constituencies in different  ways. It also reviews the effects of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Rule 116, Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions Made, and FASB Rule 117, Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Organizations, on the practice of tuition discounting. The report concludes that most of the confusion with respect to tuition discounting in higher education stems from the failure of different constituencies, namely administration, finance, and marketing, to recognize and have a clear grasp of the distinctions between their own and others' definitions.

        "description":"This study examined the characteristics of students attending historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), focusing on 14 HBCUs with student loan default rates of 25 percent or more over the last 3 years, which are high enough to jeopardize their continued participation in federal financial aid programs. It was found that, in general, students from HBCUs come from low-income families, are highly dependent on financial aid, and educationally disadvantaged, and that most HBCUs have lower endowments, less funding for institutional scholarships, lower graduation rates, and limited technological resources compared to other colleges and universities. Of the 14 HBCUs surveyed, most lacked effective default management strategies and tools, as well as effective entrance and exit  counseling in regard to student debt responsibilities. The study concluded that HBCUs could lower student loan default rates by developing default management teams that included campus leadership, hiring a default manager, increasing retention and graduation rates, involving faculty, increasing and repackaging institutional scholarships and fellowships, instituting consumer debt management courses, and joining the National Student Loan Clearinghouse. Other strategies suggested including partnerships with private industry, increases in federal Pell grant aid, increases in federal funds for retention and default prevention programs, and increased loan forgiveness incentives.

        "description":"This study examined the use of private education loans at high-cost private colleges and universities. Responses were received from 100 of the 381 institutions who reported undergraduate tuition and fees, or professional school tuition and fees, of $14,000 or higher in 1996-1997. It was found that on most campuses private student loans play a small but growing role in financing higher education. Ninety percent of the respondents indicated that students received private loans because they had exceeded the annual loan limits allowed under federal student loan programs, and fifty-one percent of the respondents reported that students received the loans because the borrowers' parents were denied access to Federal Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students. It is concluded that many  private loan borrowers will probably leave their institutions with very large cumulative student loan debts, and some may have trouble meeting the repayment obligations of both their private and federal student loans.

It underscores the direct and indirect connections between changes in federal and state policy and institutions' aid programs, focusing on the effects of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992 (including changes in need analysis and the advent of unsubsidized Stafford loans), slowed funding of federal grant programs, and increases in merit-based aid at the federal and state level. The report notes that between 1990 and 1996, the amount of scholarship and grant aid provided by public and private four-year institutions jumped from $4.7 billion to $8 billion. Among public colleges and  universities, the selective and highly selective institutions provided the largest increases in aid. For private colleges and universities, however, institutional grant aid increased by the largest amounts at the less selective institutions. The report notes that aid increases at public and private institutions have been much greater than increases in spending for instruction, student services, maintenance of school facilities, and other general and educational expenditures.

Volume 1 presents a summary of the report's findings. A total of 1,328 respondents from a nationally representative sample of 3,000 borrowers in repayment who had originated their loans between 1994 and 1997 completed telephone interviews regarding loan satisfaction and awareness of select terms and repayment options. Ninety percent of the respondents expressed satisfaction with their overall repayment experience; respondents also expressed great satisfaction with the effectiveness of exit counseling in helping them understand the terms of their loans and indicated a greater  awareness of the conditions required for a deferment and the consequences of default than borrowers in the grace period. The majority of respondents (82 percent) chose not to consolidate their loans. Most borrowers (78 percent) experienced no problems during the repayment period; of those who did, 62 percent reported difficulty in making their loan payments, 9 percent had problems with change of address forms, and 8 percent had problems with inaccurate amounts being billed. Overall 91 percent of borrowers were satisfied with their contacts with Department of Education or other loan servicers. Volume 2 presents a set of 3 appendices that includes: (1) response rates and survey methodology; (2) a questionnaire determining borrower satisfaction and its responses; and (3) the text of the 1998  telephone interview of student borrowers in repayment.

The report maintains that the Department faces major risks of Y2K failures severely disrupting the student financial aid delivery process, including delaying disbursements and application processing. Further, because of systems interdependency, repercussions from Y2K-related problems could be felt throughout the student financial aid community--a network that includes students, institutions of higher education, financial  organizations, and other government agencies. The testimony notes that while the Department is accelerating its program, it remains in a position of playing catch up due to its late start in implementing a comprehensive Y2K program. The report concludes that the Department must focus on developing appropriate contingency plans to ensure business continuity in the event of key systems failures.

The first is assessment of pedagogies in the classroom, on campus, and beyond; the second is assessment of programs and units; the third is assessment within and across institutions; and the fourth is moving from information to action. Four keynote addresses, each addressing one strand, follow: &quot;What Outcomes Assessment Misses&quot; argues that assessment is a way to clarify what we want to achieve, how we can get there, and how we can know when we have arrived; &quot;Assessment of Powerful Pedagogies: Classroom, Campus, and Beyond&quot;  examines assessment of alternative teaching methods, such as collaborative, active, and problem-centered learning; &quot;The Malcolm Baldrige Approach and Assessment&quot; discusses the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award approach to self-assessment; and &quot;Assessment of Programs and Units&quot; reviews the challenges of effective program assessment. A plenary speech, &quot;Accreditation and Quality Assurance: Ambivalence and Confusion,&quot;  discusses quality assurance through accreditation; another, &quot;Reinvigorating Science Education in the U.S.: The Importance of Appropriate Assessments,&quot;  discusses how appropriate assessment can help improve the poor state of math and science education in the United States.

        "description":"This study examined the impact of the Kansas Regents Honors Academy on students who had completed the program since its inception in 1986. A total of 504 of the approximately 1,640 academically superior graduating high school students completed a survey questionnaire that focused on demographic data, college data (degrees, majors, grade point average, and scholarships), community and leisure activities, and honors program experiences. The majority of respondents indicated that the strongest aspect of the Academy was its ability to provide them with a college experience without having to actually enroll at a university. Social awareness and peer interaction were listed as the most valuable assets gained from the Academy experience. It was also found that 79.3 percent of the  respondents remained in Kansas to attend one of the six universities participating in the Regents Academy or other Kansas institutions, and that 91.7 percent of respondents received scholarships to attend higher education institutions. At the baccalaureate level, the most popular major was biology, followed by social science, business, engineering, education, English, and math/computer science. Recommendations regarding the continuation of the Kansas Regents Honors Academy are included. A copy of the survey questionnaire is appended. (Contains 21 references and 18 tables.) (MDM)",

It notes that in 1995-1996, about 40 percent of all first-time beginning postsecondary students enrolled in four-year institutions (25 percent at public institutions and 15 percent at private institutions); another 46 percent enrolled in public two-year institutions. Overall, these percentages were the same as those for 1989-1990. In 1995-1996, 25 percent of financially dependent students from families with incomes of $60,000 or more enrolled in private four-year institutions, a considerably higher percentage than the rate for students from families with incomes in the $30,000-$59,999 range (16 percent), or for those with incomes  of less than $30,000 (14 percent). Among students enrolling in less-than-four-year institutions, the primary reason cited by 18- to 19-year-olds was the ability to transfer to a four-year institution, while students age 20 and older enrolled to obtain job skills.

Data were obtained from an international survey of 161 academic staff in Australia and the United Kingdom. Results indicated that academic staff felt undervalued, particularly as teachers, and they perceived a lack of vision and direction concerning the overall direction of their institutions. The book applies the literature on student learning and on learning organizations to key issues of change in universities, noting that stable organizations--such as traditional universities--cannot survive in an unstable environment, that organizations need to  support change, and that academic staff must learn to take responsibility for its own learning and development. The book reviews four tensions, or paradoxes, that academic staff have to balance: the vision or direction set by academic leaders versus day-to-day teaching and work experiences; individualism versus the need to work collectively; accountability versus rewards; and valuing past achievements while preparing for the future.

The OSFA ombudsman office came out of the need to improve student lending program services and to mitigate the impact of loan default on students. It was determined that students involved in lending disputes and loan repayment problems needed a source of assistance at the Department of Education. A development team was assembled to examine the issue and formulate recommendations. The team recommended that the ombudsman office should quickly and informally resolve borrower complaints, work with schools and the lending community to achieve solutions that are fair to all parties, promote easy access for borrowers, establish a  complaint-cherishing system, and improve services to borrowers. It was also recommended that the Department of Education hire the best possible candidate to become the OSFA ombudsman. Two appendixes contain a complete list of the team recommendations and a list of participants. (MDM)",

The task force solicited the views of universities, university associations, and federal research agencies regarding the issues they considered most pressing. The review found that the government-university partnership in research is sound and continues to serve the nation in important ways. To help strengthen this partnership, the NSTC is issuing a proposed statement of the principles of the partnership to clarify the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of the parties and to  provide a framework for the development and analysis of future policies, rules, regulations, and laws. The NSTC will also take specific actions, through federal agencies that fund university-based research, to make the partnership more effective and efficient, focusing on areas such as research integrity, merit review, cost-sharing policies and practices, grants administration, and regulation. Two appendixes list NSTC task force and working group members. (MDM)",

        "description":"This report examines how the Department of Education calculates the default rate for two federal student loan programs--the Federal Family Education Loan program (FFELP) and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP). The report focuses on three questions regarding these programs: (1) whether there has been an increase in the number of borrowers who entered repayment but subsequently received deferments or forbearances; (2) what the effect on default rates would have been if borrowers in deferment or forbearance were excluded from the default rate calculation; and (3) if the latter method of calculation had been used, would any additional schools have exceeded the 25 percent default rate threshold. The report found that student loans in deferment or forbearance have  increased for all types of schools; that default rates rose when borrowers with deferments and forbearances were excluded; and that under the recalculated default rate more schools would have exceeded the 25 percent threshold. The report also notes Department of Education objections to changing the method of calculating the default rate, but concludes by suggesting that Congress consider this change. Appended to the report are sections on scope and methodology and comments from the Department of Education. (CH)",

The course focuses on three general education skills--critical thinking, oral communication, and written communication--and is designed to provide a bridge between lower division LCC students and upper-division (UHWO) students, ideally as a culminating educational experience for LCC students and a beginning educational experience of UHWO students. The course is organized around five major subtopics: meaning of community;  structure of community; moral foundations; subcultures, marginalized, and invisible communities; and the individual. LCC students who satisfactorily complete the course receive three credits each in history, American studies, and philosophy, and satisfy one writing-intensive course requirement; UHWO students receive three credits each for electives in humanities, professional studies, and social sciences, and receive waivers for a required writing course and a public administration skills course. Evaluation of the learning experience is done on several levels--faculty evaluate students, students assess both faculty and the course, and faculty evaluate each other as well as the course. Overall, faculty and student evaluations of the learning community experience have been favorable.  Appended are lists of skills standards and a course schedule.(CH)",

        "description":"This case study was designed to investigate the effect on an instructor's simultaneously teaching the same course in both a distance and a traditional educational format. The study involved one male instructor-participant at a mid-sized regional university who, in one term, taught the same course in both distance and traditional format. Data were collected by observation and interviews, with the instructor allowing access to both classrooms for a 16-week term. The study found that while the instructor prepared similar materials for both distance and traditional classes, preparation for the distance education format was more time-consuming because of the need to fax materials to remote sites and to put supplemental material on the Internet. While a similar inquiry-based  instructional method was used in both distance and traditional formats, in the distance format the instructor was a \"talking head,\" with little participation and discussion from students. Other difficulties arising in the distance education format included the following: there was a need for more educational technology (e.g., faxes, Internet); in-class time-management was more complex; monitoring students at multiple local and remote sites was more complicated; and e-mail communication became so time-consuming that only distance education students were permitted to submit assignments via e-mail.

The SOAR system collects information about college performance of new high school graduates including: remedial work needed in math, English, and reading; grades in first math and English courses; and cumulative grade point average. Data about students' high school experiences are drawn from the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the American College Testing (ACT) program. This report looks at students who graduated from a Maryland high school during the 1996-97 school year and who enrolled in a Maryland college or university during the 1997-98 academic year. All public two- and four-year campuses in Maryland and 12  state-aided independent institutions are included. The report contains three sections: the first examines the differences between college performance of students who did or did not complete a college preparatory curriculum in high school; the second presents the results of a multiple regression analysis which seeks to identify factors that best predict first-year college performance; and the third examines trends in the data over the past four years.

A questionnaire mailed to all 50 state academic officers in December 1997, with follow-ups throughout 1998, resulted in 38 responses. The 21-item questionnaire covered: policy context, objectives, process, outcomes, evaluation, and future directions. The study found that while all states sought to satisfy a variety of objectives through their assessment policies, it also found significant divergence between  stated policy objectives and reported outcomes. Campus executive officers were the most consistently significant players in the assessment policy process. In examining the relationship between policy and improvement in teaching and learning, most academic officers saw improved teaching and learning and assessment policy as highly interdependent, although there was some perception that resistance at the institutional and/or faculty level hindered the effectiveness of state policies. Future case studies will be based on the findings and responses from the questionnaire. Appended is the State Higher Education Assessment Questionnaire. (CH)",

It charges that many K-12 reform policies are moving secondary and postsecondary education in disparate directions.

Among the recommendations made for rethinking higher education admissions and freshman placement policies are the following: (1) permit students to substitute subject  matter-based external examinations in lieu of standardized placement tests; (2) link admissions standards to external discipline-based state standards; (3) align freshman placement exams with other state standards and publicize placement exam content, standards, and consequences; (4) require writing samples for all admissions decisions; (5) have higher education institutions specify the courses that count toward computing high school class rank and accord appropriate weight for honors and advanced placement courses across all high schools in a state.

Specifically the study examined: (1) characteristics of working students; (2) work patterns based on student characteristics and institution attended; (3) impact of work on student performance and persistence; and (4) off-campus employment and financial aid. Findings led to the following conclusions: 69 percent of the winter-enrolled students reported they had worked at some point during the 1996-97 academic year; major differences existed in how much students earned, per hour earnings, and how many hours they worked based on the  institution attended and class standing; working did not appear to be a major influence in a student's likelihood of re-enrollment in a four-year institution nor upon student performance as measured by grade point average; and 85 percent of students received financial aid or worked in off-campus employment. Appendices provide additional detail on participating institutions, available data, on-campus employment, and work-study employment. (DB)",

Six hypothesized goals for performance-based funding were developed from the literature, and relevant government documents were analyzed in terms of these goals. The study concluded that: (1) While Alberta's government did seek to increase institutional accountability, it did not introduce performance-based funding to achieve this end; rather, a closely related reporting framework to increase institutional accountability was introduced; (2) Alberta's government did seek to increase institutional responsiveness to governmental goals by introducing performance-based funding; (3) Alberta's  government did seek to increase institutional productivity by introducing performance-based funding, although the definition of productivity used might be inadequate to realize increased productivity; (4) Alberta's government did not introduce performance-based funding as a politically feasible way to increase government transfers to institutions; (5) Alberta's government introduced performance-based funding to facilitate the introduction of a broader policy agenda consistent with academic capitalism (i.e., aligning the activities of higher education with the needs of capitalism); and (6) it was not clear whether Alberta's government introduced performance-based funding to legitimize the introduction of a broader policy agenda.

It reports on a study which compared different age groups in different types of institutions and reviews the research about how adults learn and methodologies for teaching adults. The study compared age distributions at four Texas institutions: the University of North Texas, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, the University of Dallas, and Art Institutes International. Analysis of the age demographics at the four institutions indicates that the vast majority of graduate students are age 25 and over; the number of undergraduate students age 25 and over varies widely between the four institutions. A review of adult learning theories offers one theory suggesting that educators of adults who are  interested in improving teaching use a cycle involving questioning, theorizing, testing, and reflection. Other reviews of the literature address such concerns as whether the literature adequately addresses the concerns of educators of adults, how teaching can be improved, and who is responsible for improving teaching. The paper concludes that there continues to be a need for research about adult student learning and that college programs need to recognize how older students differ from traditional students.

This report recommends that redistribution of these health care funds be governed by a formula that reflects, equally, the volume of medical education and the volume of public program service. The proposed formula is (education factor x 50 percent) + (public program volume factor x 50 percent) = trust fund percentage. Methods for calculating both factors are explained. Other related policy issues addressed include the rationale for the 50/50 balance between education and public program volume, and treatment of small sites and training sites with no public program revenue.

The program, initiated in 1996, was developed to improve community and student retention and to provide opportunities for faculty renewal and professional development. Review of the research on learning communities indicates that learning communities have substantial positive effects on retention and can reinvigorate faculty, especially mid-career faculty. The process of creating learning communities at the ACU College of Arts and Sciences is described, including interest luncheons to inform faculty members about the concept of learning communities. Three learning communities that involved integrating three courses in a thematic  approach were offered to freshmen in the fall of 1997. Problems encountered focused on such marketing errors as giving responsibility for program marketing to the admissions department and failing to integrate the learning community program into the registration procedure. These problems were addressed in the nine learning communities offered during the program's second year. Preliminary evaluation was mixed, although systematic tracking of 125 students has now begun.

It reports on a study of 26 institutions by the American Council on Education, which examined the process of large-scale institutional change. This study's findings support reading groups as an institutional change strategy and identified the following important change strategies: leaders who make a clear and compelling case for change; leaders who craft an agenda that makes sense; recognition that change benefits from a widened circle of participation; and leaders who develop connections and linkages. A related study by the ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education examined the use of the higher education literature  by practitioners. This study found that low usage of the literature by administrators for decision making could be addressed through reading groups. Several strategies for organizing the literature were identified, including on-going management reading groups, strategic reading groups, intermittent reading groups, and professional seminars. A case study of reading groups at Portland State University (Oregon) illustrates how such groups can identify themes, conduct a variety of related activities, and facilitate linkages. The paper concludes that reading groups are one way to institutionalize the concept of the reflective practitioner. (Contains 13 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"This study examined the micro-level contextual factors that impact the process of large-scale, transformational, intentional change at institutions of higher education. The study used an organizational culture framework to examine use of change strategies from the \"general\" literature on change, to identify micro-level issues and strategies that facilitate transformational change, and to investigate the importance of and relationships among these micro-level issues and strategies. Ethnographic longitudinal methodology was used to examine organizational change at six institutions. Data analysis identified five themes: (1) certain strategies or conditions are central (senior administrative support, collaborative leadership, robust action, staff development, and visible action); (2)  core and secondary strategies and conditions are interrelated; (3) sense-making emerged as the main vehicle for accomplishing transformational change; (4) balance is an important principle for effecting transformational change; and (5) culture of the campus appears to influence the change process. These principles are illustrated in two case studies depicting change at a community college and at an urban, private research university. Recommendations are made concerning the importance of institutions conducting internal analysis and reflection, the need for institutions to exploit and build upon interconnections, and the need to recognize that transformational change is about organizational sense-making.

Section 1 describes how the data is based on that which the taxonomy of courses and analyses of course-taking, credits, grades, degrees, etc., were constructed and edited. Section 2, &quot;Degrees, Majors, Credits, and Time,&quot; presents the long-term educational attainment of the two cohorts of students (classes of 1972 and 1982). Section 3, &quot;The Changing Shape of Delivered Knowledge,&quot; presents the taxonomy of courses, and includes the most common course titles in over 1,000 course categories, as well as  enrollment trends by course category. Section 4 examines all credits earned by the two cohorts and identifies which courses account for most of those credits to yield an empirical &quot;core curriculum.&quot; Section 5 provides data on proportions of students studying given subject categories; trend data is included for the past two decades. Finally, Section 6 provides data concerning such issues as trends in grade inflation and which courses students fail at high rates. The conclusion offers suggestions for further analysis of these data bases. (Contains 43 references.) (DB)",

Part 1, &quot;Teaching on the Web, What Is It?,&quot; lists advantages and disadvantages of face-to-face classroom instruction, traditional distance education, and Internet-based education which combines features from both these methods. Four proposed models of using the Internet as part of a course (i.e., informational, supplementary, dependent, and fully online) are offered, followed by a discussion of how the Internet can be used to deliver courses, what &quot;added value&quot; means to education via the World Wide Web, accessing course resources on the Web, and forms of interactivity. Part 2, &quot;Training and Skilling Teachers,&quot; highlights technology-based skills teachers  must develop and lists workshops/tutorials designed to assist teachers with the skills and support needs for developing courses on the Internet. Part 3, &quot;Challenges,&quot; proposes several questions that must be addressed when planning/implementing Internet-based instruction. (AEF)",

Conclusions from focus groups cover: current external environment in Iowa, strengths and challenges of Iowa's library community, decision making principles, and identified goals. Four major needs  for the state's libraries are: (1) expanded access to information and materials; (2) knowledgeable and well-trained library staff, public library trustees and library users; (3) better focus and utilization of services through increased resource sharing and partnerships; and (4) continued State Library leadership, programs and services.

The first section provides historical background and summarizes current services, including the collection, the facility, the university's network of faculty/school/institute/center libraries, main library departments, staff, and automation. The next section notes factors necessitating change, including economic recession, inadequate staffing, information explosion, and technological innovations. The following areas of library work that will need to be changed or improved for the library to be relevant in the 21st century are discussed in the third section: (1) collection development, including policies/procedures and the choice between print and digital information; (2) interlibrary loans  and document delivery, including the use of facsimile, e-mail, and satellite transmission; (3) the virtual library; (4) staff roles, including responsibilities of professional and paraprofessional staff; (5) the head librarian's role, including leadership, accountability, and management; and (6) other changes, including cooperative ventures, networking, charging fees, and cutting costs. The final section presents a vision for the 21st century university library that highlights reduction of red tape/bureaucracy, orientation toward meeting user needs and delivery of high quality services, library staff support of student learning, flexible structure, cooperation with faculties/institutes, an entrepreneurial approach to securing resources, and library marketing efforts.

Vendor partnership with Blackwell's Library Supply company for selection, acquisition, cataloging, and end processing of monographs and serials is described. Other ways to relieve staffing pressures are noted, including automation of clerical tasks (e.g., self check out, self reservation, and self renewal) and partnership with other libraries in resource sharing (e.g., interlibrary loan and reciprocal borrowing). Emerging critical roles for library staff are then addressed, including: working with academics to ensure appropriate inclusion of information  seeking (whether via print or electronic means) in courses offered in flexible delivery mode; seeking out membership in course development teams and faculty teaching and learning committees; and supporting the research activities of university staff and students.

The following topics are discussed: (1) past and present approaches to performance measurement, including origins of measurement and landmarks of the past; (2) a conceptual framework for evaluation, including a typology of the performance literature describing four models that organizations tend to use to measure their effectiveness (i.e., goal attainment, systems resource/external systems, internal processes/internal systems, and multiple constituency/constituency satisfaction models), and a proposed new model of organizational effectiveness (i.e., a focus/value/purpose matrix); and (3) factors affecting the use of systems of evaluation,  including library use of past research. It is concluded that there are three critical factors influencing the positive outcome of performance measures in libraries: measurement is a political activity; the multidimensional nature of performance measurement; and rewards and incentives.

The KMAT is a collaborative benchmarking tool, designed to help organizations make an initial high-level assessment of how well they manage knowledge; the KMAT can direct organizations toward areas that require more attention, as well as identify knowledge management practices in which they excel. Three types of comparison reports can be generated using the KMAT: external benchmarking compares an organization with the overall (multi-industry) KMAT database or a smaller customized group; internal benchmarking compares  an individual or division within an organization with a group of their peers; and average benchmarking compares the average of a group or individuals within an organization with the overall KMAT database or a smaller customized group.

Results of the construction of a new section of the questionnaire concerning the campus information environment and  identification of the factors that may comprise that theoretical variable are also reported. Four basic components of a faculty member's information environment were identified to serve as theoretical variables comprising the campus information environment: personal information stores; library information stores and services; information technology and networking; and the faculty member's assessment of the ease of use, personal enjoyment, and utility of information technology. The data confirm and refine many of the latent variables used as the basis for the &quot;Faculty at Work&quot; questionnaire. (Contains 19 endnotes and 5 data tables.) (MES)",

The first section presents a definition of flexible learning and addresses the implications of the following three dimensions of flexible learning: delivery methods and improved access, including focus on massification of higher education and flexible delivery of education as an instrument of massification in South Africa; learner-centered approach; and the role of resource-based learning. Resource-based learning and information literacy are covered in the second section, including the interdependence of the two concepts and their  implications for academic libraries. The third sections describes two strategies to ensure that the library plays a central role in learning activities--adapting the role of the library and information professional, and developing user education in support of flexible learning. Information user training as a means of survival in the 21st century is discussed in the next section.

The contributions made, both theoretically and in practice, by INFOLIT, an information literacy project in the Western Cape region of South Africa, are described. The first section discusses the context of globalization, information infrastructures, and knowledge systems. Information literacy theories and practices are summarized in the second section. The next section presents preliminary findings of INFOLIT related to integration of information literacy into academic courses, curriculum development expertise,  capacity development of librarians, developing coalitions, replication of courses in different contexts, regional collaboration, changing mindsets, and institutionalizing information literacy. The fourth section describes challenges related to changing teaching and learning, the need for effective evaluation studies, replication of projects, integration and mainstreaming of projects, institutionalization and sustainability, endorsement of pilot projects by senior management, collaboration and partnerships, interactive learning, needs assessments, promotion and marketing, human resource development, inclusion of all players in pilot project formulation and delivery, understanding learning, development of higher order cognitive skills and structured domains of knowledge, and school and  community information literacy models.

The first section lists the objectives of the union catalog. The state of the art of Greek academic libraries is discussed in the second section. The lack of uniformity is identified as the main difficulty in setting up the union catalog. The next section addresses implementation models, and the fourth section describes two implementation phases (i.e., formation/homogeneity of the primary database and function/updating of the union catalog). Specifications required for the union catalog system are summarized in the fifth section, including records format, quality control of records, multiple  records identification, and the data model. The sixth section considers standardization, including bibliographic standards, authorization of names and subjects, holdings information, and interlibrary loan. The importance of education and training of library staff is noted in the seventh section, followed by a section that discusses the administration scheme. The ninth section outlines project phases.

Examples of the recent history of technology related to transportation, printing, and nuclear energy are presented. Some troubling examples of the social relations of new information technologies that are emerging on a global scale are then discussed, including inequality in access to the global telephone system and computers. It is argued that modern telephone and transportation systems are contributing to the demise of urban life and precipitating the emergence of exploitative international labor practices. Examples of the implications of teleworking and electronic marketing are offered. The importance of reaching out to the technologically illiterate and educating them about new  technologies is emphasized. (MES)",

In the area of information skills training, it is argued that the librarian must contribute actively by developing these resources and ensuring that students and academic staff are made aware of their critical importance to learning. The first section of the paper discusses the new role for information professionals, focusing on two critical developments--increasing knowledge and use of new technology by users of library services, and changes in the philosophy of teaching and learning and in the environment in which teaching takes place. The following World  Wide Web-based research and development projects at Robert Gordon University (Scotland) and their implications for information professionals are described in the second section: (1) NETLEARN, a project that developed a directory of Web-based materials to support teaching and learning Internet skills; (2) ReMOTE, a project that developed of a directory of Web-based teaching and learning materials on research methods, a library of in-house materials, and an interface to allow incorporation of these materials in higher education programs; and (3) Information Skills, a scheme that developed a Web-based directory to support open or distance learners.

The integration of technology at Delft University of Technology (Netherlands) is described, including use of scanning technology, fax, and e-mail for document supply, development of a maritime knowledge center, and diversification of products and services. Pricing of new services and products is then addressed, including development of a model that breaks down costs and earnings, as well as the importance of this analysis for policy decisions, benchmarking, and accounting for government subsidies. The relationship between government and the market in the Netherlands is considered, focusing on the  possible market role of a governmental body, i.e., the hybrid organization. The Delft Library, a hybrid organization, has chosen organizational sustainability, which blends subsidy and profit. The need to compete and make profit keeps the library on its toes, while a subsidy enables it to maintain an information infrastructure that is available to the community, thus preventing a social division between information &quot;have's&quot; and &quot;have-not's.&quot; (MES)",

Such a model, which was based on Australian data, was fine-tuned to meet local Thai social and economic conditions. The research process investigated many issues with tenants in five Australian technology parks, including information needs, information use, information seeking behavior, information perception, librarian roles, and characteristics of required information services; the library information services that are already offered to tenant firms by Australian university libraries were also evaluated. The proposed Thai model encompassed five major library activities--policies, collection development,  information services, staffing, and promotion and marketing. In Australia, there were three sub-sample groups taken into account: company staff members in five Australian technology parks; the technology park managers; and librarians in Australian university libraries that have formal links with the technology parks. In Thailand, the sample group for a preliminary testing of the proposed model comprised top management personnel of King Mongkut's University of Technology, whose technology park is in the process of establishment, and of three university libraries and one public library involved in information provision. The research methodology was structured interviews with checklist questionnaires. (Contains 15 references.) (MES)",

The MSC is being planned as a high-technology center where world-class multimedia companies can develop state-of-the-art products and services. Since Malaysia is undergoing a change from an industrial to information age, the MSC will guide the country in identifying how to use multimedia services in an efficient and competitive manner and will serve as a springboard for regional and global multimedia markets. This paper uses Malaysia as a case study to describe some challenges associated with the development of smart city mega-projects and to analyze the  implications for librarians and information professionals. The underlying questions are, first, why is the MSC important to Malaysia's national development, and, second, what roles do librarians and information professionals play in the successful implementation of smart city projects? The need to increase information technology and information literacy skills is discussed, and the roles for librarians as end-user trainers and technology coordinators are highlighted.

        "description":"This report summarizes the marketing plan developed for the Scottsdale Community College Airpark Campus. In order to eradicate this campus' dependence on the main campus for leadership and funds, the author describes three strategic goals designed to make the Airpark campus self-sufficient within 3 years. The first goal involves the recruitment of students, with the target being to increase full-time student enrollment by 29 percent per year. The second goal is to reduce student attrition by at least one-third; the third goal is to use personnel in a more efficient and effective manner. Each goal--recruitment, retention and staff improvement--is then discussed in relation to 53 marketing tactics, which include the following components: area, target market, needs assessment,  market goal, tactic, frequency of tactic, completion date, office responsible, action plan, success indicators and cost. Additional research summarized in the report includes student interests; a survey reports that the student body is fairly homogenous, with most students, who are employed by local companies that support continuing education, preferring short-term, early morning and evening classes. The author recommends using this profile when marketing to potential students, and taking advantage of these findings when scheduling classes. Contains a bibliography. (JJL)",

The act declares that eliminating unnecessary state oversight will spur institutional creativity and innovation and that placing greater decision making and accountability at the institutional level will better enable New Jersey colleges and universities to fulfill their missions and serve statewide goals. The restructuring act requires the commission and the President's council to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the new structure and submit a report to the governor and Legislature on or before July 1, 1999. The report identifies the major implementation activities undertaken in the past five years and offers some recommendations. Major  accomplishments include: (1) enactment of a $55 million Higher Education Technology Infrastructure Fund; (2) a significant increase in operating aid for community colleges; (3) a bond proposal that provides $550 million for capital improvements at four-year institutions; (4) development of a broad-based transfer and articulation agreement; (5) creation of a $1 million grant program to improve graduation and transfer rates for low-income or minority students; and (6) completion of a statutorily-required study of the capacity of the higher education system.

The main purpose of the hearing was to provide public awareness and information on the articulation and transfer rate of community college students. Witnesses at the hearing made a number of recommendations and insights regarding the community colleges and the services they provide to students. The publication provides a letter of transmittal, a list of witnesses, and the transcript of the testimony. Senator Teresa Hughes, who was also the chairperson presiding over the testimony, gave the opening statement. Charles Ratliff, Executive Director of California Postsecondary Education Commission, provides a  historical overview of California's transfer students and programs. Dr. Alice Petrossian, Christopher Cabaldon, and Kathleen Nelson addressed the role of the student transfer. Making the transition happen is an issue addressed by several students -- Sandi Sawa, Caroline Walls, and Anthony Cannizzo -- who spoke of their own personal experiences at the community college. Four college and university administrators conducted a panel on enhancing student transfer. Senator Hughes ended the testimony with some closing remarks. (VWC)",

In 1997, the college's Board of Trustees began using the Carver Model of policy governance and created a new college mission statement and related end states, which directly answer the question, &quot;What good will be produced for which people, at what cost?&quot; The college also developed a strategic planning model to measure inputs, throughputs, and accountability as tied to the end states and the new mission statement. Assessment and evaluation are conducted across the Columbia Basin College community, including academic and professional programs, general education requirements, facilities, community relations, and student services. The types of activities the college  focuses on include: (1) institutional effectiveness, which involves creating a plan that outlined core indicators of effectiveness; (2) department/program level outcomes assessment, such as its nursing department assessment tool and the development of a common final by the Mathematics Department; (3) course level outcomes assessment, including a syllabus project and a &quot;one-minute write&quot;; (4) general education assessment, such as ASSET scores and a statistical analysis of the success of English courses; and (5) accountability/performance funding assessment, which is especially apparent at the Career and Transfer Centers.

This paper records Minneapolis Community and Technical College's (MCTC) first attempt at a future scenario. Members of the college's Strategic Planning Committee and others from across the campus came together to develop \"stories\" about the college's future. The resulting scenario is not meant to be seen as a definitive plan or set of decisions. It is, in fact, a \"speculative tale\" about the current perceptions of the future. From a practical standpoint, the college is helped by taking \"an imaginative leap into the future.\" Once there, the college can  take stock of its surroundings and begin planning for the future from the future. This futuristic paper begins with a preface that sets the time in 2003, 7 years after MCTC became a comprehensive community and technical college. According to the scenario, the faculty, staff, and administration have built a highly regarded, student-centered college known for high-quality educational programs that consistently meet community needs and provide a solid gateway to lifelong learning.

The Multifactor College Leadership Questionnaire II (MCLQ-II) was used to survey the self-perception of community college leaders and the perceptions of followers/team members who work with these leaders. There are five orientation sub-scales of the MCLQ-II: intuition, influence, people, motivation and ethics. The survey respondents included 51 African-American and 41 Anglo-European vice-presidents and deans, as well as 146 followers/team members (38 African-American, 102 Anglo-European, and 6 of unknown ethnic background). Findings suggest  that African-American and Anglo-European leaders have no significant differences in self-perception of leadership competency for four of the five sub-scales. For the fifth sub-scale, ethics, African-American leaders ranked their competencies significantly higher than their Anglo-European counterparts. Findings also suggest that followers/team members perceive no significant differences in transformational leadership competencies of African-American and Anglo-European leaders. Based on these findings, further research on ethnic differences in the ethics sub-scale is recommended. Appendices include the MCLQ-II, cover letters sent to participants, and a confidentiality statement. (Contains 26 tables and 60 references.) (RDG)",

Prepared by the firm Paulien &amp; Associates, Inc., of Denver, Colorado, this prototype will serve a design basis for facilities at all Pima Community College (PCC) campuses. The prototype will not be implemented exactly as described, but rather will be adapted for various-sized campuses. The Library/Student Center is designed to be a one-stop resource that provides student services, academic support, a student center and library services. Based on findings from the College Learning Services Project, this facility will provide more efficient delivery of services from formerly isolated administrative units. It will include extensive  technological infrastructure designed to be flexible enough to meet future student needs. The space program divides the prototype into four elements: student services (12,000 square feet), library (23,000 square feet), academic support (17,500 square feet), and a student center (25,000 square feet). The various services and departments within each element are described, along with tables that outline space allotted to each service. Student services include offices such as admissions/registration, advising, a career/transfer center, cashier, and financial aid. Academic support includes computer resources, a learning center, testing offices and tutoring. The student center contains a bookstore, cafeteria, meeting rooms, lounge, and space for student organizations. (Contains 25 tables and 2  figures.) (RDG)",

The newsletter touches on certain curriculum issues, mentions again the Academic Excellence plan (retitled &quot;Partnership for Excellence&quot;), and contains an article on freedom of speech issues at Santa Rosa J.C. The October issue reports on several annual gatherings, such as the Great Teachers Seminar, the Occupational Leadership Seminar, the Summer Leadership Institute, and the first Technology for Teaching Institute. The practices of Western Governors' University, a distance education university, are discussed, and it is argued that it should not be accredited.

        "description":"The purpose of this article is to explain each of the three phases of reading textbooks and to provide strategies for aiding students to better understand and connect to their textbooks in each of these phases. Each of the three phases is named for its writing counterpart: planning, drafting, and evaluating. This article also states that three types of awareness are necessary for students to do well: task awareness, strategy awareness, and performance awareness. This presentation utilizes strategies taken from the author's textbook, \"Making Connections: Reading and Understanding College Textbooks,\" which teaches students not only to read for facts and to pass a test but also to apply the facts to their own lives. The first phase in the reading process is the planning phase, which  involves previewing and predicting, accessing prior knowledge, and creating a purpose. Phase two of the reading process is the drafting stage, where active reading, requiring metacognition, is the key to success. Finally, the third phase of the reading process is the responding or evaluating phase, in which students need to react and relate to what they have read, and thus are aware of what they know and what they still need to know.

The Strategic Plan identifies three strategic issues: Quality, Access, and Efficiency. Twenty-four goals are identified, each accompanied by relevant statistics, facts and figures. Goals for quality include: (1) implementation of the Coordinating Board for Higher Education's (CBHE) recommended 16-unit high school core curriculum; (2) Advanced Placement opportunities in every Missouri high school; and (3) all newly certified public school teachers must be as highly qualified as possible. Goals for access include: (1) participation of minorities in Missouri's system of higher education that is at least, in proportion, equal to their representation in the state; and (2) a statewide  network of area vocational technical schools and expanded community college service regions. Goals for efficiency include: (1) no public four-year institution that is highly selective or selective will offer formal remedial course work; (2) admissions decisions at all public institutions will reflect the statewide admissions guidelines for standards appropriate to their selectivity; and (3) the number of students completing programs of study in trades and disciplines determined to be critical to Missouri's future will more than double over the number of degrees conferred in these areas for academic year 1990.

The Plan is divided into four sections: Introduction, Vision and Mission, Applications, and Infrastructure. The four major goals identified in Vision and Mission are: (1) to ensure the successful use of all technologies through continued training of faculty and staff; (2) to maximize technology to preserve access, improve retention, and increase student success; (3) to provide extended learning opportunities through development of telecommunications capabilities; and (4) to strengthen articulation, cooperation, and collaboration among educational systems and other agencies through integrated technology. The main applications of technology are Internet access, campus-based e-mail,  a World Wide Web server, multimedia classrooms, distance education, client server, Virginia Community College System (VCCS) Intranet access, a telephone registration system, and the automation of the college's Learning Resources Center. During the 1996-1997 school year, computer instruction was provided to 2100 students in 135 classes. Planned distance education methods include Web-based courses, interactive video courses, CD-ROM courses, and telecourses. The infrastructure section describes existing facilities and systems, including a table showing number and types of computers at various campus locations. The following upgrades are necessary to meet VCCS standards: upgrading of computers in the learning center, upgrading classroom and administrative computers, furnishing more classrooms  with multimedia equipment, and obtaining software.

Analysis of such indicators will provide colleges seeking to internationalize with a baseline of information from which to work. The validation process involved a review of literature on the topic and gathering of expert opinions from two panels. The first panel, numbering 10 jurors, was asked to judge the content, accuracy, and clarity of a validation document. A rating instrument of 12 areas and 175 indicators was established. The second panel, consisting of 30 raters, then rated the areas and indicators in the rating instrument using a Likert scale. The raters were grouped into professional categories to ascertain  relationships between groups of raters and their ratings. Analysis of the data produced areas rated as most important (in descending order): faculty development, internationalizing the curricula, American student study abroad, presence of international students on campus, administrator development, student exchanges, intercultural studies, co-curricular events, area studies, membership in international educational consortia, technical assistance projects with international institutions or countries, and work abroad. The author recommends that the high-rated areas receive more attention and resources from internationalizing colleges. Contains 159 references and seven appendices. (RDG)",

In fall 1996, 231 students transferred to JMU from in-state community colleges. The major feeder community colleges were Northern Virginia, Blue Ridge, Lord Fairfax, and Piedmont Virginia. The average first-year GPA of transfers was approximately 2.70, compared to 3.00 for all JMU students. Eighty percent of transfers were on the President's List, the Dean's List or in Good Standing, compared with 91% of all JMU undergraduates. The most popular majors for transfer students were Psychology, History, Computer Information Systems, English, and Sociology. JMU participated in a Course-Based Model of Transfer Success (CBMTS) that compares  transfer student and native student performance in courses requiring prerequisites. The disciplines with the highest transfer student GPAs were Elementary Education (3.75), Nutrition (3.57), and Early Childhood Education (3.40). Average GPA for transfer students was below 2.00 in several subjects: Accounting, Biology, Chemistry, Economics, English, Math, and Psychology. With the exception of Chemistry, transfer students majoring in these disciplines had an average GPA above 2.00. Transfer students had an average GPA of below 2.00 in 17 courses, many in disciplines that require a high degree of analytical skills. (RDG)",

The FDRP was developed for use within the Connecticut Community-Technical Colleges and as a guideline by which the faculty's performance is to be rated and improved. The goals of the FDRP are to establish an evaluative process for faculty, to have an information base for supervisors, and to form the basis for fair personnel decisions. Faculty members are expected to manifest a minimum degree of instructional excellence as defined in the Statement of Instructional Excellence in four categories. The categories are: (1) motivation and the ability to motivate others; (2) interpersonal skills; (3) knowledge base; and (4) skill  at applying that knowledge. Four methods are used to evaluate those qualities. Students' ratings conducted in sections taught by faculty are one method. Another is instructional observation, in which a syllabus or outline of the faculty member's course is evaluated. The third, self-appraisal, has the faculty member rate his/her own effectiveness. The fourth, overall performance, is an evaluator's written evaluation of the faculty member's strengths and weaknesses concerning the four categories of instructional excellence, and a conference between the evaluator and the faculty member. All faculty members are expected to develop and update an individual professional development plan in collaboration with the supervisor. Appended are the Statement of Instructional Excellence, performance  standards and indicators, and sample forms. (JA)",

        "description":"The Community College Act of 1966 was enacted to redraft and unite the laws relating to community colleges in the state of Michigan. This document includes the original document plus amendments passed as of March 1999. The first part deals with the creation and government of districts. This includes districts comprised of elementary and intermediate school districts, the annexation of counties and townships, and also descriptions of the board of trustees. The first part deals extensively with the process by which districts are formed, including eligibility of school districts, the filing process, and definition by size. It also contains guidelines on how to hold elections, both for positions on the board of trustees (of which there are 7) and annexation elections. The second part  deals with the general powers and duties of districts. It discusses districts as corporate entities, their legal names, and the various powers, duties and responsibilities of the board of trustees. The board has power much akin to that of a chief executive officer. Its role is largely financial, as they must handle much of the districts finance and prepare estimates of spending and taxes for the coming year. The second part also deals with public safety officers and police officer on college campuses, and their power, responsibilities, and jurisdiction within the college. (JA)",

        "description":"Noting that day care is a tangible facet of American family life, this paper examines the essential components of quality child care, presents strategies for improving child care quality, and discusses social policies and issues related to quality child care. The paper first examines six criteria, proposed by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), for judging day care quality: (1) staff-child ratios; (2) group size; (3) caregiver qualifications; (4) caregiver stability and continuity; (5) structure and content of daily activities; and (6) space and facilities. To determine the effect of day care on young children, researchers examine progress in verbal, cognitive, and social skills, and appropriate achievement in emotional and physical health.  Reviewing the literature, the paper finds that early childhood educators are concerned with the intellectual, physical, and social aspects of child development as a result of day care. The paper then details strategies for improving the quality of child care: (1) supporting low-income children and families; (2) training of child care staff; (3) accreditation of model programs; (4) fiscal regulations; (5) licensing regulation; and (6) child care information and referral. To achieve quality day care, the paper offers the following recommendations: (1) increased federal financial subsidies for low-income families; (2) upgraded compensation and training of child care staff; (3) state and local standards for child care quality; and (4) expansion of resource and referral services.

The book begins with a rationale for conducting interviews with children, notes that interviews can result in insights regarding children's perspectives on learning and their comprehension of the surrounding world, and suggests ways adults can use such insights in instruction. The book continues with detailed information on conducting interviews, including practical arrangements, using of group or individual interviews,  questioning techniques, following up a question, and being an active conversation partner. Information and examples are presented regarding interpreting children's interviews, including information on reliability. The use of information obtained from children's interviews for evaluation planning and parental involvement is illustrated. The book also provides tips on using available time for conducting interviews. The book concludes with a discussion of children's interviews within a wider perspective and considers the potential clash between scientific thinking patterns developed at school and everyday thinking, children's spontaneous questions, the teacher's role, and cooperation between the preschools and other practitioners.

        "description":"Although there is considerable evidence linking the security of children's attachment to their mothers to child competence and adaptive functioning, the distinct picture of adjustment problems characteristic of each pattern of insecure attachment has received less research attention, especially during middle childhood. This study examined the concurrent associations between the child's representation of the mother-child attachment relationship and adaptive functioning in the school during middle childhood. Participating were 113 fourth and fifth graders; subjects were given the Doll Story completion task, which had been modified for their use. Based on this measure, children were classified as secure, avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganized with regard to attachment representation.  Teachers assessed each child's academic achievement, emotional and social adjustment, and frequency of behavior problems. Each participating class underwent a sociometric procedure. The findings indicated that secure children showed better adjustment to school as reflected in teachers' reports of scholastic, emotional, social, and behavioral adjustment, as well as in peer-rated social status. Discriminant analyses allowed identification of distinct profiles of problems for each insecure attachment representation prototype. Almost 94 percent of the subjects were correctly classified into their attachment representation prototype. (KB)",

        "description":"This paper examines the importance of children's early experience and its implications for the future. The paper notes three important societal changes--changes in women's roles, changes in the concept of marriage, and changes in the nature of childhood--and discusses the factors underlying these trends. Current research suggests that the architecture of the brain is more plastic than was previously thought, and  windows of opportunity in early learning may be lost or limited if they are not appropriately capitalized upon during early childhood. Noting that children today are least safe in their own homes and most safe in early education and care settings, the paper describes two parent support programs for at-risk parents. The paper describes the immense socializing power of the  media as demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of the U.S. culture. Problems with media use are noted, such as the impact of violence and the use of television as a childminder. Implications of these social changes for the child, family, and early education and care are explored: (1) care and education are so interwoven that it makes most sense to see them as thoroughly interdependent; and (2) effective and sensitive parental support must accompany the provision of good institutions. The paper concludes by noting that J. Bowlby's central beliefs in the importance of helping families have not been discredited and that the challenge is to ensure the melding of care and education into a secure profession.

        "author":["Evans, Robert"],
        "description":"The decline in civility, social responsibility, and institutional affiliation challenges the nature of schooling. Child development in the 1990s family is under pressure from changes that deny children the three basic essentials (nurture, structure, and latitude) for psychological health, effective learning, and civility, and that require children to adapt and sacrifice while favoring adult well-being. In addition to family changes, the school is challenged by: (1) a call for expanded academic curriculum; (2) an improved understanding of student learning; (3) an abdication of child-rearing tasks by family and other social institutions; (4) diminished student readiness and civility, and accelerating parental demands and criticism; and (5) faculty resistance to and resentment of  changing status with parents. Schools' typical responses to these changes are: (1) case-by-case--try to restore proper respect as an incident occurs; (2) get them help--offer help for individual violations; or (3) train them--seek to improve behavior and communication through social and emotional learning. Results of these approaches since the 1980s are mixed and suggest that a change in perspective is needed. Rather than \"How can the school overcome problems,\" schools need to ask, \"How might the school reduce problems and prevent some of them?\" as a means of strategically restructuring relationships with families. To widen consensus within the faculty, school staff need to clarify the purpose and conduct of school and parents, focus on strengths rather than deficiencies, and commit to a  few central values. Once this commitment has been made, schools need to introduce the consensus to students and parents by using an array of forums and by continuing initiatives that renew information. In the current climate, challenges can be met only by moderating demands or increasing supports. (DLH)",

        "description":"This paper addresses recent educational policy developments in England and Wales, focusing on the National Literacy Strategy, National Numeracy Strategy, and the proposed Early Learning Goals. The paper delineates research findings regarding the early mathematics and English learning achieved before entry into formal schooling, effective teaching practices to support learning in the preschool years, and the knowledge that children bring to school. The paper further presents representative examples from data narratives to illustrate current practice in reception classes in England and Wales. Two narratives reveal that over the course of a year, there was a shift in the pedagogy for literacy from differentiated literacy group activities and hearing individual readers to a Literacy  Hour format, with more guided or group reading taking place. In addition, the narratives reveal differences in the subject knowledge of teachers and in the extent to which they are clear and comfortable about how to teach literacy most effectively to the very youngest pupils. The paper maintains that knowledgeable and skilled teachers offer their classes rich literacy experiences that are both systematic and learner-centered through time-economic, focused, direct teaching. The paper notes that the discourse used in the proposed &quot;Early Learning Goals&quot; contrasts strongly with the Scottish Office Curriculum Framework 3-5, concluding that although early years teachers need to use the frameworks offered by the National Literacy Strategy and the Early Learning Goals to inform their planning,  they must maintain their belief in what they know about the effective ways that young children learn best.

The targeted population was comprised of elementary and junior high school students in an economically diverse, predominantly blue collar community in central Illinois. The problem of inability to problem solve, listen actively, resolve conflict, and deal with anger was documented by means of teacher observational checklists of student behavior, office disciplinary referrals, teacher surveys, and teacher journal entries. The 5-month intervention was comprised of cooperative learning activities, conflict resolution and anger management techniques, and a modified school-based student management program. Program effectiveness was assessed by comparing pre- and  post-intervention measures in the number of disciplinary referrals, behavior checklists, student interviews, and teacher observations recorded in journal entries.

The targeted population consisted of 22 third graders attending a midwestern elementary school in which almost half of the population comes from low income families. The problem of low self-esteem was documented through teacher anecdotal records, a teacher questionnaire, a student survey, and a parent survey. A survey of the literature revealed potential solutions to self-esteem problems, including  experiencing self-accomplishment through real effort, feeling valued at home and school, and learning interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. The 4-month intervention was comprised of a program incorporating weekly cooperative learning activities and teaching to the multiple intelligences. Weekly student journal entries were also included to encourage student reflection. Assessment methods of program effectiveness included a modified student survey, teacher anecdotal records, and student journal entries. Post-intervention data revealed an increase in students' self-esteem, an improvement in attitudes about school, more positive feelings about self, development of friendship skills, and an improvement in independent work completion.

An implicit curriculum is one that is crafted within the thinking processes of individual teachers but not written down or published, and therefore not able to be replicated by others. Based upon the assumption that the curriculum approach used in educating young children should be based on goals for guiding their education in a systematic way, this paper addresses the relative value of explicit and implicit curriculum approaches for young children. The paper uses the definition of curriculum from the National Association for the Education of Young Children as a basis for comments regarding explicit and implicit curricula in the following areas:  (1) subject area knowledge structures, presenting examples of content frameworks, for mathematics, science and health, and music; (2) sequential learning; and (3) uniformity and consistency of educational experience. The paper concludes by noting that it is the integration of four considerations--the learner, knowledge, personal and social development, and instruction--that determines the quality of educational encounters presented to young children. To over- or under-emphasize any one consideration may produce a flawed curriculum and instructional program. (KB)",

        "description":"Noting that although many Western educators praise the Japanese educational system because of its students' academic achievements, schools in Japan have developed severe and prevalent problems with student bullying. This paper examines the problem of bullying in Japanese schools. Part 1 of the paper reviews bullying incidents in Japanese schools from the mid-1980s to the present time. Part 2 delineates three types of bullying that are common in Japan: (1) psychological; (2) physical; and (3) violent. Part 3 outlines features differentiating contemporary bullying and bullying in previous eras, including current &quot;invisible&quot; methods of bullying, bullying by a majority of the class, the disappearance of &quot;brakes&quot; on bullying incidents, and contemporary difficulties in distinguishing  teasing and joking from bullying. Part 4 examines four main explanations for bullying in Japanese schools, explanations from the perspective of society, school, family, and children. Part 5 discusses the measures taken by the Ministry of Education regarding bullying and argues that such measures have been ineffective and have resulted in bullying becoming more insidious and invisible to adults in the victim's life. Part 6 presents recommendations for resolving bullying problems in Japanese schools, includes an example of a successful intervention in a Tokyo junior high school, and describes Norwegian anti-bullying programs. The paper concludes by noting that bullying is an urgent problem and that the school system needs to identify concrete and unique school-wide anti-bullying  intervention programs specific to Japanese schools.

        "author":["Penn, Helen"],
        "description":"The apparently simple question of whether there are commonly accepted &quot;best practices&quot; for infant and toddler care leads to further questions regarding the nature of childhood and the impact of cultural values. This report reviews recent theory, training, and practice in the care of children outside their homes. Section 1 of the report argues that much of current knowledge about infancy is derived from the normative context established in Anglo-North American child development studies. This section considers these predominant assumptions and their implications for practice. The legacy of attachment theory is analyzed, especially the assumption that out-of-home care is less desirable than care by mothers. This section further argues that the child-centered approach and  desirability of structured play reinforces individualism. Section 2 of the report explores European traditions of theory and practice. This section describes five parameters of practice, focusing on ideas about: (1) the nature of relationships between adults and very young children; (2) children as learners; (3) health and well-being; (4) training employment for those who work with young children; and (5) ecology and the environment. The report also illustrates the program content in European settings, the importance of language diversity, the concern with the environment and its impact on programming, and the emphasis on developing values of non-aggression and cooperation by promoting interactions between children.

This paper, written by two of the network's four members, explores the different notions of autonomy in early literacy learning which animate the four different projects. The paper observes that autonomy is not a simple matter where literacy is concerned; differences exist between autonomy of outcome (orthographic autonomy and autonomy of meaning-making) and autonomy in the learning process (autonomy of participation, cognitive autonomy, autonomy of interpretation, autonomy of composition, and autonomy of judgment). Exercise of autonomy at one level may inhibit  its development at another. For example, children who are accorded a large measure of autonomy of participation, that is, control over the initiation of activities, may not choose those activities that allow them cognitive autonomy. Consequently, their development of orthographic autonomy may be significantly delayed. The paper concludes by posing a series of questions suggested by comparison of evidence from different countries, challenging a number of axiomatic beliefs about innovative literacy teaching and learning.

The digest discusses the importance of parents' level of comfort at school and in talking to teachers, and provides examples for ways parents have become more comfortable and confident. Also described are ways parents can communicate with the school without visiting the school. The digest discusses difficulties in communication when parents speak languages different from that of the teachers, have different backgrounds, or have lived in the United States for only a short time, and provides suggestions for improving communication in  these situations. The digest notes the importance of parents from backgrounds different from that of the teacher sharing their views with the school in order to help the teacher understand their child. The digest concludes by noting that teachers need to know about the child's life outside of school in order to do their jobs better and that parents need to find a way to communicate with their children's teachers what is right for them.

        "author":["Huddleston, Rich"],
        "description":"This report examines the financial needs of Arkansas families, and establishes, using conservative economic assumptions, an annual Family Income Standard (FIS) for the state and each of its counties. The FIS is a new tool to be used by citizens, state and local policy makers, civic organizations, non-profits, and parents as they look to improve the economic well-being of their communities. The components of the standard include the essential living expenses of families with children, such as: (1) child care; (2) food; (3) housing and utilities; (4) transportation; (5) health care; (6) clothing and miscellaneous items; and (7) taxes. Because the standard reflects the resources needed to support a family with children without outside assistance, it does not include public  assistance such as food stamps, Transitional Employment Assistance, subsidized child care or housing, or subsidized health care such as Medicaid. To develop estimates of the FIS for Arkansas, a modified version of the approach popularized by Wider Opportunities for Women was used. The 1999 Arkansas FIS reveals that families require an income close to 200 percent of the current federal poverty level to meet basic daily living needs. The standard is $18,805 annually for a one-parent family with one child (assumed to be under age 6), $22,372 for a two-parent family with one child, $24,833 for a one-parent family with two children, and $28,541 for a two-parent family with two children.

This study extended previous research on popularity by examining children's perceptions of popularity. The study used open-ended questions instead of peer nomination only and also examined gender and differences. Participating was an ethnically diverse sample of 92 children in the fourth through eighth grades. Subjects were asked to provide free descriptions of four types of peers: popular boys; popular girls; unpopular boys; and unpopular girls. Their responses were coded for content and valence. Stepwise discriminant function analyses were conducted to determine how well children's  answers discriminated among the four types of peers. Repeated measures analyses of variance were performed with participant age, gender, and status as between-subject factors. The findings indicated that popular targets were described most frequently as physically attractive and socially competent, while unpopular targets were described primarily in terms of physical unattractiveness, infrequent social interaction, and deviance. Girls tended to hold more negative stereotypes than boys did, especially regarding popular girls, and older children placed more emphasis on physical appearance than did younger children. (KB)",

Next, the digest offers suggestions for helping a child's education at school, such as using  translators, getting to know the child's teacher, attending parent-teacher conferences, and learning about school rules and school programs. Finally, the digest offers suggestions for addressing problems with the school, such as being persistent, using the district's appeal process, and talking with parents and advocates outside the school.

        "description":"Little is known of children's knowledge of text search processes and the role of metacognition. This study examined middle school students' knowledge of text search strategies and the correlation between metacognitive awareness and search efficiency. Sixty-nine students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade were observed as they searched in an informational book for answers to six questions. For five questions, students could use a relatively simple locate strategy because the questions contained terms that were indexed in the book. The sixth question required students to generate a term that might be located in either the index or table of contents. Students also completed a survey assessing their awareness of the relative utility of text features for locating information. The  survey asked students to list text features that they would use to locate an answer to a specific question and to rate the utility of 15 standard textbook features. Students also completed the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory, a questionnaire designed to measure regulation and knowledge of cognition. The findings indicated that students were successful and fast at locating answers to the five questions containing indexed terms, but much less successful with a question that did not lead to an entry in the index. The strategies used to locate the information were rated on a scale comparing the students' search to that of an ideal strategy; students were more strategic with indexed questions than with the non-indexed question. The two scales of the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory were  correlated with search performance and strategy ratings and were predictive of search efficiency and strategy. (KB)",

Targeted were 20 students in prekindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade classrooms in two suburban Chicago schools. Misbehavior such as talking out, not keeping their hands to themselves, being off-task, not cooperating, and not participating was documented by means of classroom observations and anecdotal records. The intervention was comprised of 16 classroom lessons using each of the 8 intelligences; lessons were implemented in October and November of the school year. Visual aids were used to ensure that students understood the  intelligences, and graphic organizers were used to engage students in the learning process. Anecdotal records, progress reports, and report cards were used to document changes in student behavior. To assess the effects of the intervention, classroom observations were completed in September, October, and November, with comparisons made in the number of instances of talking out, not keeping hands to self, being off-task, not cooperating, and not participating. Each student's strongest intelligence was identified, and it was determined if the student was behaving properly during a lesson geared toward that particular intelligence. The results suggested that 77 percent of students showed an improvement in their behavior when working on activities geared toward their strongest intelligence.  Behavior improved from September to November. (Twelve appendices include data collection forms and sample materials. Contains 18 references.) (KB)",

This action research project evaluated an intervention to increase high school students' motivation, responsibility, and initiative. Students were enrolled in a freshman English or Spanish class and one art class comprised of students from all grade levels in a parochial high school located near Chicago. The needs of parents, students, and faculty with regard to the educational process were identified by means of surveys; students' needs were identified as being distinct from those of the other two groups. The one-semester intervention used cooperative learning, authentic  assessment, journal writing, and portfolio development to meet students' needs for belonging, power, freedom, and fun within the classroom environment. In order to assess the effects of the intervention, the initial survey determining student needs provided baseline data. Observational checklists were completed throughout the study to assess progress in student participation and motivation. Self-assessments and portfolios were also used to assess student responsibility for learning and motivation. The needs survey was re-administered to identify needs not met by the intervention. The findings indicated a positive correlation between the teacher's intervention to meet student needs and the level of student motivation.

A brief history of Hispanics in the state notes that most of Oregon's Hispanics are of Mexican origin and that the state's Hispanic population grew 66 percent between 1990 and 1997. The history of migrant agricultural labor in Oregon is reviewed, and one chapter notes that increasing numbers of Hispanics are participating in politics, showing special interest in bilingual education, English-only legislation, immigration and welfare reform, and affirmative action. A chapter on general labor force issues reveals that Oregon's Hispanic labor force has more than doubled since 1990, unemployment rates and high school dropout rates are higher for Hispanics than any  other group, and less than two percent of postsecondary degrees awarded in Oregon were earned by Hispanics. An examination of employment trends shows that Hispanics are represented in all major occupational groups, with agriculture no longer their primary employer; many occupations common for them have lower skills and educational requirements and lower pay; Hispanics are not well represented in professional occupations; and Hispanic-owned firms have increased. A chapter on income and wages finds that Oregon Hispanics earn less than the state average, and documents the relationship between education and income. Hispanic contributions to the economy are noted, and barriers to employment are discussed in the last two chapters. (Contains 37 data tables and figures.) (TD)",

To prepare for the year of conversations across the state, the ambassador formulated three questions that she asked everywhere she went: 1) What is good about your school? 2) What would you change to improve the quality of learning? and 3) Does the school have a school improvement plan? This report presents the information and thoughts that resulted from grouping the answers into categories and converting them to usable data. Six categories emerged from the first two questions: organizational structure of schools, quality of education and instruction, resources for schools, governance of schools, school culture, and people and relationships.  Each category is discussed, beginning with a graph depicting items most mentioned in response to the first two questions. Themes raised by the third question include why some respondents had only a vague knowledge of a plan, the process involved in creating plans, the results of planning, ownership of the plan, and criticisms of school improvement plans. A fourth question was posed to approximately 30 administrators and teachers: How do we know when students learn? Eight vignettes scattered throughout the report provide insights into the issues discussed. An appendix presents the ambassador's schedule. (TD)",

For each topic, brief project descriptions provide insight into the number and diversity of people  involved in development of RRDC programs, links to other organizations and institutions, integration of research and outreach, relevance to regional or national issues, and effects on rural people. Challenges faced by RRDCs include rapidly changing economic and policy settings, new cadres of professionals involved in rural development without access to training and research support, increasing demands for accountability for all programs, shrinking resources in the public sector, increasing ethnic diversity, and environmental conflicts.

Information was gathered from a literature review, state agencies, the 1990 decennial U.S. census, focus groups, and interviews. A demographic overview shows that 26 percent of the Texas population in 1992 was Hispanic, primarily Mexican American, and 80 percent of the population of the border counties was Hispanic. Sections on poverty, employment, education, and health reveal that, to a disproportionate degree, Hispanic children live in poverty, caused in part by the unemployment and underemployment of their parents; attain low levels of education, as did their parents; inhabit substandard  housing; experience high rates of teen idleness, juvenile crime arrests, and high school dropout rates; and are underserved by health and social services. These problems are exacerbated in the border counties by political and geographic isolation. Recommendations are made concerning economic development, the need for more resources, international cooperation, and the need for targeted programs and research.

This report summarizes current Alaska Native employment data and employment trends, provides information on public and private programs that target Native hire, and describes promising approaches for increasing Native employment. Part 1 examines the current context of Native employment, including demographic data and projections related to the size and location of the Native labor force; availability of jobs in various sectors and industries; characteristics of Native employment and unemployment; data on nonresident employment; and creation of jobs through the economic multiplier. This section includes 31 data tables and 15 figures. Part  2 discusses the potential effects of welfare reform on Native communities, summarizing changes to welfare and community concerns. Parts 3-5 examine methods used by private businesses, Native regional corporations, and governments to recruit, train, and hire more Natives for existing jobs; the potential of private and government programs to create more jobs for Natives; and barriers to increased employment and strategies for overcoming them. Part 6 describes organizations specifically intended to help improve Alaska Native hire. The conclusion offers nine approaches that seem most promising for increasing Native hire and suggests that rural Alaska Natives may have some advantages in data processing, firefighting and hazardous material crews, and ecotourism. Appendices summarize relevant  regulations and list people and organizations contacted. (SV)",

By working together, rural schools and communities can not only improve education, but revitalize the entire community. The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory is helping to establish partnerships in its region through the Rural Development Collaborative Action Team project (RD-CAT) which links school and community development using two strategies. These strategies include building local capacity to work in school and community teams through the CAT process and working with these local teams to plan and carry out activities such as service learning and entrepreneurial training that link school  instructional programs and community development projects. CAT's three-dimensional approach employs team building, team planning, and momentum generation. Service learning and entrepreneurial activities teach students valuable skills, connect students to their community, and provide useful services to the community. The RD-CAT in Balmorhea, Texas, illustrates what can happen when the school and community join forces. Sixteen programs have been planned or started, including a successful school-based rural health clinic and a school-based community weather station used for science classes. Accomplishments of other school-community programs in Alabama, Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Carolina are briefly described. (CDS)",

        "description":"The essence of the politics of language is the choice of audience. This paper analyzes politics of language and choice of audience in the work of two liberatory educators, Myles Horton and Paulo Freire. Horton and Freire had much in common, each working to create educational processes to benefit the poor and each focusing on liberation for the systematically oppressed, Freire at first in Brazil, Horton in rural Appalachia. However, Myles Horton is little known among academics, while Freire is a virtual icon in the field of education. Four reasons for this relate to choice of language and audience. First, Horton saw his work as part of a collective project, typically using &quot;we&quot; rather than &quot;I,&quot; while Freire was willing to be a leader and expert. Second, Horton chose primarily to  speak, rather than write, while Freire wrote many academic books and articles. Third, Horton avoided involvement with the academic world, having learned that the language of the academy was ineffective in accomplishing the goals of Highlander Folk School in Appalachia, while Freire wrote and spoke often in academic language. Last, Horton defied and had contempt for governments, while Freire regularly worked with governmental institutions in several countries. Horton's success in creating a school that functioned outside the control of government and the influence of academia was based in his unwavering conviction that collectivism, localism, the lived experience of poor and working people, and the rejection of theory were the essence of truly progressive education. This approach to  education could prove more fruitful than Freire's has been. (Contains 33 references.) (SV)",

Chapter 1 discusses the high Hispanic dropout rate; why Hispanic students drop out; stereotypes and realities; and HDP recommendations encompassing minimum guarantees of a quality education, schools' relationships with parents and families, the role of teachers, effective school strategies, and educational policy. Chapters 2-5 describe specific effective programs: (1) Lennox (California) Middle School's approach to personalizing the curriculum and involving parents and families; (2) Calexico (California) School District's secondary-level strategies,  including emphasis on equity, commitment to bilingual education, a culture of continuous refinement, high expectations and support for meeting them, and alternative dropout programs; (3) three elementary programs--Success for All, Helping One Student to Succeed (HOSTS) (a mentoring and tutoring program), and Cognitively Guided Instruction (mathematics problem solving using students' prior knowledge); and (4) two secondary programs--the Coca-Cola Valued Youth program, in which high-risk middle school students tutor younger students, and Project AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination), which features coaching, advocacy, and college preparation. In Chapter 6, four HDP members summarize observations and recommendations related to the quality of instruction, role of bilingual  education, effects of tracking, resources and physical conditions, investing new resources, achieving attitudinal shifts, teacher preparation and professional development, identification and implementation of effective programs, challenging content and valuable relationships, individualization, time for results, aspects of program design and implementation, and politics of education.

The most recent reliable data (1990) for American Indians and Alaska Natives show a rate of FAS over 10 times the national rate. People with FAS or fetal alcohol related conditions (FARC) are at high risk for learning disabilities, hearing impairments, and mental retardation. Section 1 of the manual presents current definitions of FAS and FARC, summarizes the diagnostic process, and outlines embryological origins. Section 2 explores common primary and secondary disabilities associated with FAS and FARC, as well as their impact on long-term functioning and  vocational placements. Section 3 looks at common tools in the functional assessment of people with FAS or FARC, including one for use by vocational high school counselors. Section 4 is a practical guide to developing an individualized plan for employment, education, services, or programs. Trainees are asked to develop a plan for each of three illustrative case studies. Sections 5 and 6 cover the design, implementation, and ongoing evaluation and adjustment of an individualized plan and provide additional practice for the trainee. Appendices include the Fetal Alcohol Exposure Risk Assessment for Adolescents and Adults; an outline of psychosocial needs associated with FAS in adolescents and adults; &quot;Vocational Development for Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effects&quot;  (Georgiana Wilton); and abbreviations.

        "description":"There is a great need to increase the number of American Indian students in psychology, especially in clinical and counseling psychology. Nationally, there are fewer than 200 American Indian psychologists, and most mental health services for Indian people are provided by paraprofessionals, who may be poorly trained for this function. In addition, Indian people tend to experience more psychological problems than non-Indians, having higher rates of alcoholism, depression, and suicide. The lack of American Indian psychologists is a multifaceted problem, involving lack of cultural relevance of pathology-oriented models and lack of psychologist role models for prospective Indian students. The ability of university psychology programs to attract American Indian students is influenced  by the small size and geographic concentration of the Indian population, the isolation of Indian students in rural areas and on reservations, student poverty, and biased admission criteria. Student recruitment efforts could be improved through the commitment and support of the entire psychology department, the recruitment of Indian faculty members, faculty travel to schools and tribal areas, advertisements in tribal publications, and establishment of an Indian student center on campus. Retention of Indian students in college could be improved by making reasonable accommodations for cultural differences, establishing support groups and mentoring relationships, and getting feedback from American Indian graduates.

A pilot training workshop conducted in Aztec, New Mexico, focused on the importance of service providers understanding American Indian culture and on independent-living strategies for outreach. At the close of the workshop, participants developed Blue Print for Action Plans. Progress outcomes were measured by a 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month evaluation of each action plan and its efficacy. Evaluations described completion of action plan steps, resources used, any revision of steps, barriers encountered and how they were overcome, and exciting aspects of the action plan. Evaluation results  revealed that 43 percent of participants had to revise their action plans because of barriers associated with &quot;finding American Indian consumers&quot; due to isolated areas of the reservation and cross-cultural communication problems. A common solution to these barriers was &quot;persistence in outreach services.&quot; Results indicate that 44-56 percent of participants who used the pilot training workshop methods for over 6 months increased their level of independent-living service delivery to American Indian clients. Appendices include the workshop agenda, evaluation forms for the workshop and action plans, handouts, a timeline, and the project advisory committee. (Contains 18 data tables and figures.) (SV)",

The IAF promotes equitable, participatory, and sustainable self-help development in Latin America and the Caribbean by awarding grants directly to local organizations, as well as by entering into partnerships with public- and private-sector entities to scale up support and mobilize resources for grassroots development. In 1998, IAF's primary objective was to bring together communities, governments, and businesses to invest in local development. Community leaders increasingly recognize that no sector alone can confront the widespread challenge and hazards of poverty. In support of cross-sectorial partnerships, IAF awarded 84 new grants and 14 supplemental  grants and carried out other program activities totaling $20 million. About 34 percent of grant funding went to food and agriculture programs; 26 percent to enterprise development/management; 21 percent to education and training programs; and the remainder to community services, research and dissemination, and ecodevelopment. Educational programs included strengthening community rural schools, training health promoters and day care workers, vocational and technical training for youth, increasing participation of indigenous peoples in local governments, business education, agricultural education, leadership training, and health promotion and training. This report briefly describes new and supplemental grants by country, corporate outreach initiatives, fellowship programs, and IAF  publications and videos, and summarizes financial information.

The program consists of 100 hour-long sessions, each including an introduction to a specific topic, review of group knowledge level, discussion around key points displayed on a poster, assessment, and follow-up activity. Topic categories are identity, rights and responsibilities, nutrition, health, first aid, child development, environment, small business projects, and for those over age 12, adolescence, violence against women, marriage, pregnancy, family planning, and sexually transmitted diseases. The program was developed in three upper Egyptian rural governates with low female education and  literacy. A diverse group of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) assembled a team of fieldworkers who identified rural girls' problems and needs, chose 17 topics as the foundation of program materials, trained local volunteer facilitators, and evaluated early field tests. Notable program features include a comprehensive assortment of topics, an integrated approach to working with rural parents and communities, cultural and social sensitivity, simple manuals for facilitators, and replicability. Over 100 New Horizons Girls' Learning Centers now operate in four governates. Positive program impacts include changing traditional harmful practices and attitudes, building girls' confidence and status, creating demand for literacy and education, and encouraging girls to share new ideas within the  family. Appendices list NGO program developers, program topics, and a chronology of program development. (SV)",

        "description":"The current educational emphasis on the &quot;global community&quot; misses the most immediate and concrete area where students can make a difference: the locality. Without negating the importance of having a sense of responsibility toward the global community, a pedagogy of place argues that children cannot comprehend, much less feel a commitment toward, issues and problems in distant places until they have a well-grounded knowledge of their own place. The place that one inhabits can teach about the interdependency of social and natural systems. Understanding a pedagogy of place is understanding the purpose of education: the development of competence, care, and appreciation in political, environmental, and aesthetic areas. Two public secondary schools serving poor students in Colombia  promote a pedagogy of place that defends the integrity of the community and surrounding environment. Fernandez Guerra Secondary School in the semi-urban town of Santander de Quilichao uses an interdisciplinary approach in which each grade focuses on a locally relevant theme and a social or ecological project. Tomas Herrera Cantillo Secondary School in the isolated village of Penoncito engages students in organic agriculture and animal husbandry projects relevant to sustainable community development. Examples show how the schools transmit competence, care, and appreciation in the direction of political, aesthetic, and environmental awareness and also prepare students for national standardized tests and avoid parochialism.

Over a three semester period preservice elementary education students taking an environmental science course, which incorporated inquiry strategies along with national recommendations in environmental and science education, were given the actual form of the Science Laboratory Environment Inventory (SLEI) and the Environmental Issues Attitudes Defensibility Inventory (EIADI). Mean scores for the five scales of the SLEI questionnaire provided a learning environment profile which characterized this classroom as one with a high degree of student cohesiveness and open-endedness. Pre- and post-mean scores were analyzed for any  significant change for EIADI data. Results showed no significant change in students' environmental attitudes but did show positive changes in students' defensibility scores. These findings are consistent with previous studies by Kinsey (1978), Kinsey and Wheatley (1980, 1984) and Yount and Horton (1992). Data collected in this study provide contradictory evidence to the claim that environmental education influences students' decision making processes and attitudes about the environment.

        "description":"This paper presents a set of reflective strategies for inquiry to help students in the process of learning science by conducting their own investigations. Reflective strategies are actions students can take to evaluate their progress and understanding as they conduct their investigations in order to be more systematic and effective. We also present a set of instructional supports intended to foster these strategies. These supports are embedded both in the design of learning environments and in teacher practices. We present a case example of students conducting an investigation as part of a unit on natural selection in a regular level introductory biology class at a Chicago public high school. These examples illustrate the use of these strategies by students. In particular, they  demonstrate how in a collaborative context reflective strategies take the form of questions and suggestions posed between students. Analyses of strategy use and discussions reveal that more attention was focused on articulating a story about the specific episode that the students were investigating, and less attention was devoted to understanding how this episode is an instance of natural selection. Yet, extending students' understanding of natural selection is also an important learning goal. We conclude with a proposal for future designs to address this issue. (Author)",

        "description":"This document was created to establish competency goals and objectives for teaching and learning science in North Carolina for grades K-12. It contains the concepts and theories, strands, skills, and processes upon which all science instruction should be based. In addition, the curriculum defines and illustrates the connections between the National Science Education Standards, the Benchmarks for Science Literacy, and state standards. The 1999 revision further reflects the recommendations of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science framework and assessment. The approach to this curriculum follows four major strands across all grade levels. These strands--Nature of Science, Science as  Inquiry, Science and Technology, and Science in Personal and Social Perspectives--provide unifying threads of understanding that are supported by competency goals. The Science Standard Course of Study does not include all science, but focuses on what all students should understand and be able to do as they move towards scientific literacy. The Basic Educational Program for North Carolina's Public Schools specifies that the North Carolina Standard Course of Study is the curriculum that should be provided in all schools throughout the state.

The phenomenon, which was selected for the pictorial computer simulation, PICCO, was the variations of sunlight and the heat of the sun as experienced on earth related to the positions of the Earth and the Sun in space. The research experiments carried out in school and in day care centers,  has found that children's exploration of the selected phenomenon using PICCO has supported the formation of children's conceptual models of the phenomenon in the direction of the currently accepted scientific knowledge. The results were discovered both in the situations where children explored  the phenomenon using PICCO spontaneously without teaching and at school where children were taught at the same time about these phenomena. The new research is important because the earlier results brought out challenging and new findings especially concerning conceptual change in children's conceptual models of the astronomical phenomena. Future research will compare results especially with the theoretical model described in the author's earlier research and will take into account new aspects and perspectives. The PICCO project generates important theoretical knowledge for children's explorative learning, which is one of the most important skills for efficient lifelong learning. (Contains 22 references.)

If this last component is not sufficiently present, then we may be quite efficient in presenting students with rote information. If this last component is sufficiently present (and carried out well), then students are afforded the opportunity to construct meaning from symbols and images in a manner that allows them to \"see\" (like a connoisseur) and sort out the underlying relationships that represent the \"character of the subject.\" As science educators strive to find the proper balance, reform efforts encourage increased collaboration between subject matter specialists and Colleges of Education. This paper points to a fundamental  tension that typically exists between Colleges of Education and Arts and Sciences, and suggests that each college has historically different ontological, epistemological, and methodological commitments (different paradigms). Such community differences inherent among content-specific disciplines and between colleges, which are deeply entrenched in historical paradigm commitments, reveal the oversimplification of science teacher education reform mandates that stress true interdisciplinary (and transdisciplinary) collaboration.

        "description":"In 1994 the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), a federal grant-making agency joined forces with the Arnot Art Museum and Elmira College, both located in Elmira, New York, to coordinate a survey of museums in the United States for the purpose of collecting specific information about the full range of educational activities that museums offer to the nation's schools. This document is a a highlight of the survey results. A random sample of 600 was drawn from the IMLS institutional database of 11,700. The results, collected over a 3-year period, created a baseline profile of the status of museum education and presented a strong picture of the educational programming museums provide schools. U.S. museums (of all types) are providing more K-12 educational programs than  ever before. Museums spend $193 million annually on K-12 programs; 70 percent of museums have at least one full-time paid staff who offers such programming. Collectively, U.S. museums provide nearly 4 million hours of educational programming. Museums report substantial use of school curriculum standards in shaping educational programs for a variety of school subjects. Museums offer a wide range of learning activities, such as teacher triaging, staff, docent guided tours, and museum staff visits to school classrooms. Museums also provide resource kits, learning trunks, and traveling exhibits to schools. The commitment of museums to education programs for schools is growing. At least 70 percent of the institutions report an increase in the number of students, teachers, and schools served in  the last five years. (BT)",

Some of the training sessions, such as reflection and defining service learning, may be useful for non-school-based programs as well. Most of the guide, however, is shaped by the belief that service learning is &quot;good education.&quot; Service learning is as an experiential teaching strategy with an ultimate aim of promoting student understanding of established content, concepts, and skills. Intended to help teachers add service learning to their repertoire of instructional methods, the guide outlines 10 training sessions  emphasizing curricular relevance, cognitive reflection, and experiential pedagogy. Following a brief introduction, the 10 sessions are entitled: (1) &quot;Defining Service Learning&quot;; (2) &quot;Curriculum Infusion&quot;; (3) &quot;Reflection&quot;; (4) &quot;Experiential Education and Active Learning&quot;; (5) &quot;Student Involvement&quot;; (6) &quot;Community Involvement&quot;; (7) &quot;Assessment&quot;; (8) &quot;Citizenship Competencies and Service Learning&quot;; (9) &quot;Policy&quot;; and (10) &quot;Project Evaluation.&quot; Planning sheets also are provided.

        "description":"To help immigrant children succeed academically, the teacher must seek to ease the pain of the uprooting experience and find ways to awaken the power within the children to help themselves. This paper describes teaching experiences that led one teacher to understand immigrant children's psychology and the interventions necessary for giving self expression and voice to these children. The paper discusses a center for immigrant children of various cultures that the teacher ran in 1980. The children were taught to use art to express themselves through storytelling. The paper contends that, in the end, regardless of policies, philosophies, theories, and methodologies, the success or failure of an individual child and the way that child experiences school depends on what happens in  that child's classroom, what kind of learning environment the teacher is able to provide, and how well the teacher is able to attend to the particular needs of that child. The paper questions what the relationship between psychology and language is, and summarizes major themes in addressing the inner world of the immigrant child. The four themes that form a foundation for work with immigrant children are: (1) the need for a nest, a classroom nest; (2) the necessity to examine language arts textbooks; (3) the necessity for early academic intervention; and (4) the need to explore art because it is the medium that connects psychology and language.

        "description":"This executive summary describes the implementation and effects of Project Transition, a program designed to help high school freshmen succeed by combining three strategies: student-teacher clusters with shared schedules, extra time for teachers to work together, and teacher coaching to support instructional change. Project Transition was implemented at two high schools: one in Kansas City, Kansas, and the other in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It examined the effectiveness of the strategies on students' attendance and performance in the freshman year. Evaluation data came from student surveys, observations, interviews, focus groups, and school records. The project was more fully implemented at one high school than the other, and the planning process was stronger with more teacher  involvement at the more successful school. At both schools, it created a more supportive environment for students and teachers, though in different ways. It achieved positive effects on selected academic outcomes at the school where it was more fully implemented. Students and teachers perceived benefits to and drawbacks from shared schedules, though teachers were less likely to perceive benefits. Daily teacher team meetings functioned stably, with content focused on student problems or integrated curriculum units. The coach and learning resource partners were generally not well received by teachers. The project had positive effects on student self-perception and small effects on student achievement at the more successful school. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper addresses the need for teachers to begin with a theoretical framework that prepares them to handle the realities of working with cultural, economic, and language minority students. Two perspectives of cultural pluralism (multicultural education and critical pedagogy) provide such a framework. Although multicultural education lacks a consensual definition and theoretical framework for analysis, it offers much to the content and process of schooling, especially cultural pluralism. Critical pedagogy presents a more in-depth perspective on the structural and contextual forces that impact the educational experiences of students within a culturally pluralistic classroom. It explains how power and politics interact to reinforce social inequalities in the classroom. This  perspective views public education as a mechanism that perpetuates the problem of some students making it in the system while others fail, with the classroom becoming the arena that marginalizes such students. Within the context of total school reform, multicultural education and critical pedagogy can overlap. Both help explain how schools cater to the status quo; advocate for students to become critical thinkers capable of examining their own life circumstances to better control their own destinies; and address cultural pluralism within the context of teacher preparation. This framework addresses the needs of both educators and students within the context of schooling. (Contains 35 references.) (SM)",

One neglected characteristic of constructivism apparent in the professional literature is the need to better understand that human relationships in the classroom are often pivotal in helping students construct knowledge. This paper employs the crucial connection between humanistic psychology (counseling and psychotherapy) and cognitive psychology (construction of knowledge) as the theoretical and research foundation to highlight how constructivism relies upon mentally healthy relationships in the classroom. Key elements of the change process and human interaction inherent in a constructivist perspective are provided with the hope of further advancing  the judicious implementation of such ideas.

Participants were 40 individuals who provided direct care or instruction to individuals with intellectual disabilities or who had administrative responsibility for them.

Data analysis produced four belief systems: (1) normalization advocates, who were strong supporters of human rights for individuals with intellectual disabilities and believed in the importance of instructing them about sex and the moral implications of participating in sexual activities; (2) supporters of abstinence, who ardently supported sex education for individuals with intellectual disabilities to prevent  possible abuse, who did not support sex outside of marriage, and who believed that this population could not successfully participate in marital relationships; (3) responsibility and control proponents, who strongly supported providing sex education to individuals with intellectual disabilities and offering extensive birth control measures; and (4) humanistic stalwarts, who were the strongest supporters of human rights for individuals with disabilities and contended that sex education, including birth control, is the right of all who can understand. They believed that individuals with intellectual disabilities should be allowed to participate in sexual activities and marriage with procreation if desired. (Contains 32 references.) (SM)",

This report summarizes results from 35 state surveys and 13 local surveys conducted among representative samples of school principals and lead health education teachers in 1996. Most states and cities required health education in grades 6-12, and most taught a separate health education course. The median percentage of schools that tried to increase student knowledge on certain topics was less than 72 percent for each topic. The median percentage of schools that tried to improve certain student skills was greater than 69 percent for each skill. The median percentage of schools that had health  educators coordinate health education was 33 percent across states and 26.8 percent across cities. Most schools taught HIV education during required health education courses. Over half had written policies on HIV infection among students and staff. A median of 41.0 percent of schools across states and 25.8 percent across cities had a lead health educator with professional preparation in health and physical education. Across states, the median percentage of schools whose lead health educator had received inservice training on specific topics ranged from 15.6-51.4 percent. Of schools that received parental feedback, most reported receiving positive feedback. Thirteen tables comprise the bulk of this article. (Contains 11 references.) (SM)",

The 76-item survey was identical to the national survey, though it omitted questions about sexual behavior. It examined unintentional and intentional injuries; tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; risky dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. In 1995, the survey was administered to 3,291 students in grades 9-12 in 40 public schools. Results indicate that by the time students entered 9th grade, many had engaged in behaviors that put them at risk for the significant health and social problems of youth and childhood. Many Utah students continued to engage in health risk behaviors throughout their high school years.  Overall, there were few statistically significant increases or decreases from year to year in percentages of students engaging in health risk behaviors. Too few students wore helmets on bicycles and motorcycles; too many males carried weapons; the rate of violence in Utah schools was too high; too many students seriously considered suicide; too many students used harmful substances; and students needed significant improvements in dietary and physical activity behaviors. Data from other sources indicated that students were engaging in high risk sexual behaviors. (SM)",

Potential candidates had been isolated in their pursuit of certification because there were no support groups, courses, or manuals specifically developed for them. The practicum was designed to organize the district's National Board Certified teachers and the candidates so that equitable services were available to all. A Candidate Support Network was established. The Human Resources Development Department assigned candidates to mentors and then gathered and distributed resource material for all mentors to share with their candidates. Candidates met with their mentors in small groups  and individual sessions. All mentors provided guidance and assistance by reading candidates' entries, reviewing videotapes, and giving feedback. Data analysis revealed that candidates who pursued National Board Certification reported that the Candidate Support Network effectively provided assistance which enabled them to complete the portfolio portion of their certification requirements. Mentors provided valuable guidance and support in study groups and individual conferences. The data showed that candidates who had a mentor who was certified in their area had more positive feedback about the Network than did those whose mentors were certified in other areas.

A summer program offered expert instruction and emphasized age-appropriate sports instruction and skills development as well as instruction in alcohol/drug abuse prevention,  nutrition, personal health, career opportunities, and job responsibilities. Each mentee was tracked throughout the program. Evaluation involved survey questionnaires. Each mentee, mentor, and guest speaker completed a survey questionnaire during one seminar session and again, later, by mail. The evaluation examined the effectiveness of recruitment methods, mentoring workshops, and the mentoring process. Results indicated that the program was able to help retain at-risk African-American males in the public schools. The program made a positive impact on mentees' lives.

During the fall of 1996, participating teachers will be given a pre-assessment and post-assessment. The assessments are designed to give some information on how teachers construe cross-culture conflicts before and after they participate in the program's professional development activities. Teachers read and comment upon brief scenarios depicting a problem situation that would likely be resolved differently, depending on the person's culture-based value system. Then, teachers are asked to imagine how a typical parent from a specific ethnic group might resolve the problem. Teachers' responses before  and after the workshops will give insights into the effectiveness of the workshops and into the ways that attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge can be influenced. At the end of the pre-assessment session, teachers will complete a questionnaire that gives essential information about their education, teaching experience, and language background and the ethnic composition of their classrooms. This will be helpful in understanding the perspectives they bring to analyzing the scenarios on the pre- and post-assessments. The appendixes contain the Bridging Cultures pre-assessment, post-assessment, and participant questionnaire. (SM)",

        "author":["Bickmore, Kathy"],
        "description":"It is important to discuss sexuality with elementary students. Elementary teachers can help children learn to share public space with people who are similar and different from themselves. This should include discussions of homosexual people. One reason to discuss sexuality in elementary schools is that it is already present in students' lives (via public spaces, media, and peer groups). Sexuality is present and visible in public images experienced by virtually all Western children, and value judgments are implicit in these images. Curriculum resource materials and teaching strategies employ these value-loaded images long before they admit to talking about sex. Gender role socialization, including the accompanying devaluation of homosexual identities, is an inevitable element of  how children are guided to behave by the hidden curriculum of peer interaction and school activities. Often teachers who make independent choices to discuss this controversial issue are presumed homosexual and thereby at risk of job loss. There is no evidence that explicit sex education leads to increased sexual behavior, but teachers do not get much latitude to teach about sexuality. Questions of sex, gender, and homosexual identity can fit into elementary curriculum in many places. Many recent curricula emphasize respect and tolerance for diversity. The mini-society of elementary classrooms becomes more inclusive when all members respectfully interact with diverse individuals and unfamiliar ideas. (Contains 44 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This study followed Sternberg and Horvath's (1995) prototype view to sketch a teaching expertise schema as the hypothetical model. An interview of 13 novice, beginning, and expert teachers was used to examine the adequacy of the model. The participants were asked to comment on slides of classroom events. Their think-out-loud protocols were coded using two coding systems (knowledge domains and levels of processing). Then, their active pedagogical knowledge was drawn for further content analysis using quantitative and qualitative methods. Results indicated the appropriateness of the hypothetical model to treat experts' knowledge as the prototype of teacher expertise. However, significant differences existed between novice, beginning, and expert teachers' knowledge, so some  modifications (e.g., fuzzy nature, knowledge element features, weights of subdomains, and knowledge organization) were recommended. Expert teachers possessed more knowledge than beginning and novice teachers. (Contains 26 references.) (Author/SM)",

        "description":"Teacher education in the U.S. faces a critical dilemma: preparing white, middle-class preservice teachers to teach increasingly diverse student populations in public schools. Early field experiences (EFEs) show promise for addressing this mismatch, yet little is actually known about what happens to preservice teachers in practicum experiences. This research examined the experiences of preservice teachers in an EFE, which combined a foundations of education course and a general methods course, along with classroom, school, and community-based field experiences, within the larger context of a college of education that actively sought to recruit and prepare teachers for a multicultural society. Modeled after Zeichner's (1996) notion of an educative practicum, the EFE and the  accompanying courses occurred in an urban middle and elementary school complex in a large southwestern U.S. city. In this article, the experiences and perspectives of two preservice teachers (a Mexican-American woman and a white woman) are highlighted, with particular attention to their participation in multiple communities, their use of multiple literacies, and their shifts in practices, understandings, and voice over the course of the EFE. Implications for field experiences, admissions criteria for teacher education programs, and recruitment and retention of members of underrepresented groups are discussed. (Contains 45 references.)

The 1998 ALT-YRBS measured priority health risk behaviors among students at alternative high schools. It used a three-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 who attended alternative high schools. Results indicated that many alternative high school students engaged in behaviors that increased their likelihood of death from motor vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Comparing ALT-YRBS results with 1997 national YRBSS results demonstrates that the prevalence of most  risk behaviors is higher among students attending alternative high schools than among students attending regular high schools. Some risk behaviors are more common among certain sex and racial/ethnic subgroups of students. (Contains 18 references.) (SM)",

The CHIP helps meet the complex health care needs faced by low-income, uninsured adolescents, including those with special needs. The report also examines key research and reports and discusses the experiences of various related organizations in adolescent health financing and delivery. After presenting a background, the report describes research methodology and discusses major issues for adolescents under CHIP: benefit package, outreach and enrollment, assuring access to care, confidentiality, adolescents with special needs, school-based/school-linked health centers, quality assurance,  evaluation, and linkages with other health and social service programs. Findings related to each issue are presented. Overall, states are responding to the challenge of implementing CHIP with creativity and innovation. They realize that low-income adolescents have unique health needs that require targeted efforts. The four appendixes contain names and titles of interview respondents, respondents' priority issues for adolescents, summary of CHIP programs/plans for surveyed states, and resources on CHIP and adolescents.

        "description":"Beginning in the 1992-93 school year, the North Carolina State Board of Education authorized administration of North Carolina-developed end-of-grade tests aligned with the state's &quot;Standard Course of Study.&quot; These state-normed tests were administered to more than 568,000 students in grades 3 through 8 in 1998-99. End-of-course tests were developed for high school to measure achievement on curricular goals and objectives with an emphasis on higher-order thinking skills to over 630,000 students in 1998-99. Grade 3 pretests were administered to more than 98,000 students early in the 1998-99 school year. A high school comprehensive test in reading and mathematics was also administered, for the first time, to students in grade 10. This document contains preliminary results for these  tests. These results may be used to make grade-to-grade, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons. The &quot;State Testing Results,&quot; when released, will be a comprehensive compendium of student performance on these tests. The preliminary results show areas of achievement gains by North Carolina students in some areas. Disparities in performance among ethnic subgroups were noted for the grade 3, end-of-grade, high school comprehensive, and end-of-course tests. The achievement test results of students with limited English proficiency are also outlined. (Contains 91 tables and 7 figures.) (SLD)",

        "description":"It is generally acknowledged that the earnings differential between those who have college degrees and those who do not is large, but whether higher achieving students who do not go on to college earn more than lower achieving students has not been clarified. Research from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 shows that the labor market does not generally reward efforts to excel in school for those who persevere to graduation. In the United States, a situation has developed in which those under the age of 21 are pretty much treated alike in the labor market. The age-level of jobs that pay more and have career ladders and fringe benefits seems to be rising toward the mid-20s. Young graduates who are not rewarded in the years just after high school are not likely to  realize this, and this makes raising high school achievement levels and graduation rates more difficult. Overall, there is a disjuncture between the age at which public education is completed and the age of economic adulthood. (SLD)",

Students (n=17) at two levels in a postgraduate music therapy course were assessed for their levels of prior knowledge, interest, and the number of strategies they used to process information. They were presented with a video clip of a music therapy session and asked to recall as much as they could of what transpired. The following week they were asked again to complete further questionnaires and to recall whatever they could from the video. Recalls at times 1 and 2 were correlated 0.078. Knowledge correlated 0.206 with recall 1, whereas interest correlated -0.004 and the number of strategies correlated  -0.371. On the second occasion, knowledge, interest, and strategies correlated 0.059, 0.419, and 0.364 respectively with the amount of recall. Results fail to support the knowledge component in a model of domain learning in music therapy but support the minor influence of individual interest and strategies together with a social disposition that correlated 0.324 with recall at time 2.

        "description":"This study focuses on the computer laboratory class as a learning environment in university courses. In it, two previously developed instruments, the Computer Laboratory Environment Inventory (CLEI) (based on an instrument designed by B. Fraser, G. Giddings, and C. McRobbie, 1993) and the Attitude towards Computing and Computing Courses Questionnaire (ACCC) (M. Newby and D. Fisher, 1997), were used. The CLEI has five scales for measuring students' perceptions of aspects of their laboratory environment. These are Student Cohesiveness, Open-Endedness, Integration, Technology Adequacy, and Laboratory Availability. The ACCC has four scales: Anxiety, Enjoyment, Usefulness of Computers, and Usefulness of the Course. These instruments were administered to 208 students taking computer  courses (programming or applications). With the exception of Laboratory Availability, all the environment variables were found to correlate significantly with all attitudinal variables. The only environment variable with significant association with achievement was Student Cohesiveness. However, the results show that there are significant associations between the attitudinal variables, Anxiety, Enjoyment, and Usefulness of the Course and achievement. Regression analysis supports the findings that the environment variables make a significant contribution to the attitudinal variables, and these in turn make a significant contribution to achievement. Structural equation modeling supports the hypothesis that the computer laboratory environment affects achievement indirectly by directly  affecting students' attitudes.

The school district decided to fulfill this objective by developing student electronic portfolios. In spite of careful planning, the development of the electronic portfolios was filled with difficulties. Staff members persevered, developing electronic portfolios geared to the programs of six magnet elementary, middle, and high schools. Evaluation of the portfolio development process resulted in the identification of five specific lessons: (1) it may be better to develop traditional portfolios first and then mediate them; (2) schools should start small with this type of technology; (3) schools should take the time to find the right  software for the electronic portfolios; (4) both students and teachers need to have access to the portfolio at any time from any place in the school; and (5) technology support is essential.

        "description":"This paper describes alternative assessments being used successfully at two elementary magnet schools in North Carolina and summarizes case studies of the assessment development process. Assessments, grade levels, school years, and school districts in the case studies differed, but commonalities in developing the assessments enabled the researchers to adapt a seven-step practice-based model from the SouthEastern Regional Vision for Education (SERVE), the federal education laboratory in their region, to describe the process. In one school, the assessment system was a continuous progress method of evaluating students and communicating information to parents. In the other, the assessment incorporated the multiple intelligences and arts integration aspects of their curriculum. To see  if the model might be applicable to other schools, it was used as part of a teacher in-service program on assessment for 30 elementary school teachers and then presented to a second group of teachers at a summer institute. Information from the multiple data sources of this study indicates that the practice-based assessment model derived from the initial case studies is effective for other schools. (SLD)",

Of particular interest were the contributions of these noncognitive variables to explaining ACT Assessment performance (over and above course work taken, grades earned, and high school attended). The sample for the study consisted of 5,489 ACT-tested students from 106 schools who had completed a survey about their perceptions of themselves, their homes, and their school environment. From 47% to 65% of the variance in ACT scores was explained by high school grade average, core courses taken, education-related factors, activities, background characteristics, students' perceptions of self, and high school attended. Students' noncognitive characteristics  explained less than 15% additional variance in ACT scores, over and above grades and course work taken. However, by themselves, students' noncognitive characteristics explained 31% of the variance in the number of years of mathematics or science courses taken. These results suggest that noncognitive characteristics impact students' choices of high school course work and the grades they earn in these courses, which, in turn, are strongly related to ACT scores.

Eisner's discussion is expanded to suggest that qualitative research in educational leadership and school administration also is not monolithic. Researchers in school administration now embrace a plurality of methodological approaches, and this move toward pluralism, away from methodological meta-narratives, is a healthy one. The first part of this essay traces the recent history of scholarship in educational research as it moves away from modernity. The second part analyzes the epistemological shifts in the research&quot;problem&quot; in school administration. The use of educational images may be more appropriate to capture the range of nuanced understandings in educational research, and the arts seem to hold exceptionally strong promise to capture the nonscientific dimensions. The ultimate need is for a conception of aesthetics in both research and practice. Metaphorical language is well-suited for communicating research into educational school administration and educational leadership. (Contains 35 references.) (SLD)",

As in the real world, success on examination tasks was determined by the examinee's final product, not interim keystrokes. A specially developed scoring program evaluated results of examination tasks. In the final examination format, examinees received a detailed score report immediately on completing the examination. The beta versions of the examinations were administered over a 3-month period to 171 people. A follow-up questionnaire was then sent to all of these beta examinees. Respondents reported feeling that the examination was  fair (80% agreement) and a good test of their skills (90% agreement), and they also reported that taking the examination was a valuable experience (95% agreement).

Information about student achievement will be used in planning and implementing school improvement. The Benchmark examinations measure whether students are achieving statewide academic standards in reading, mathematics, and writing. Results are reported to individual students, schools, and school districts to provide information on student strengths and weaknesses. Each examination contains multiple-choice, short  constructed-response, and extended constructed-response test items. The sample questions for each of the three benchmark levels (grades 3, 6, and 8) illustrate the kinds of questions students face on the Benchmark Examinations.

The existence of hypothesized dimensions of teacher attitudes and practices was studied, along with the relationship among MSPAP gains, percentage of reduced or free lunch students, and composite scores on dimensions of the teacher questionnaire. A stratified random sample procedure was used to obtain a sample of 72 elementary and 36 middle schools. Some students were also asked to respond to some of the items from  the teacher questionnaire related to current mathematics instruction. Analyses indicate that elementary teachers were more likely than middle school teachers to report that they place greater emphasis on mathematics learning outcomes and reform-oriented problems and that their mathematics instruction has been influenced by the MSPAP. Analyses also suggest that only approximately 15% of instructional tasks reflect the majority of characteristics of the MSPAP tasks. (Contains 17 tables, 8 figures, and 27 references.) (SLD)",

The dimensions of the questionnaire concerning practices and attitudes related to the MSPAP were studied, as well as the extent to which the on-grade and off-grade teachers differed on these dimensions. The extent to which principals and students differed from teachers with respect to a subset of the dimensions was also examined. The final samples for language arts included the teachers, principals, and some students from 59 elementary and 31 middle schools. For the science questionnaire, the final sample contained 103 elementary and 58 middle schools. Overall, evidence suggests that  the MSPAP is having an impact on classroom instruction to some extent. The majority of the language arts and science teachers indicated that they have made changes in their classroom activities to reflect the Maryland learning outcomes and the MSPAP. According to the teachers, the impact has been similar between the on- and off-grade levels. When differences occurred, they were primarily between elementary and middle school teachers, with elementary school teachers tending to respond more favorably than middle school teachers. Most teachers indicated that the MSPAP is a useful tool for improving instruction, but the majority also indicated that they oppose using the MSPAP for identifying schools for rewards or recognition.

        "description":"A prevailing assumption underlying statewide performance-based assessments is that they not only serve as motivators in improving student achievement and learning, they also encourage instructional strategies and techniques in the classroom that are more consistent with reform-oriented educational outcomes. Given these high expectations, more comprehensive and direct evidence for the consequences of assessments (both negative and positive) need to be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between changes in the scores from the Maryland School performance Assessment Program (MSPAP) science performance assessment from 1993 to 1998 and classroom instructional and assessment practices, student learning and motivation, students' and teachers' beliefs about  and attitude towards the assessment, and finally, student characteristics. Using growth models estimated within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, several factors for each of these dimensions were observed to explain a significant amount of the variability in school performance. The paper discusses these factors as well as the design of evaluations that hope to study the impact of assessment programs on students, teachers, and schools.

The SAT I predicts FGPA about equally well across different ethnic groups. Correlation of the SAT I and the composite of SAT I scores and HSGPA with FGPA were generally higher for women than for men, although this pattern was reversed at the most highly selective colleges. Adjusting for differences in course grading policies increased correlation by about 0.05. When a single prediction equation was used for all students, men tended to get lower grades than predicted, and women got higher grades than predicted. Adjustments for course difficulty reduced underprediction, and there  was no underprediction for women who intended to major in mathematics or scientific fields. African American and Hispanic/Latino men received lower grades than predicted, but women in these groups performed as predicted by the composite. (Contains 4 tables, 6 figures, and 17 references.)

In essence, it functions as an infrastructure that both students and teachers rely on as a mediational tool for classroom activity and communications. The research described in this paper investigated the classroom assessment infrastructures created by three teachers involved in the Learning through Collaborative Visualization (CoVis) Project from 1993-94 to 1995-96. Each of the three teachers under study either created a new course or rationally reformulated an old one in an effort to incorporate project-based science pedagogy and supporting technologies. Their instructional goals and the role projects played within  them varied widely, as did their assessment infrastructures. This paper provides a brief case study of each course that outlines the complex relationship between their curricular and assessment designs. In addition, a cross-case analysis demonstrates the common challenges faced and solutions used by the teachers as they crafted assessment infrastructures in support of project-based science activity.

However, the extent to which the classroom instruction and assessment activities reflect the many characteristics of the MSPAP tasks is more limited. Slightly more than one-third of the instruction and assessment tasks were  classified at one of the two highest score levels on the MSPAP scale, and 49% of the reading and 66% of the writing MSPAP test preparation activities were classified at one of the two highest levels.

Six types of deficient items are discussed. The  first five types lead to nonparametric item characteristic curves that cannot be fitted well with a 3-PL model. The sixth category, in which the item has insufficient information, is the most difficult to correct. A set of factors has been developed to help deal with these problems and increase the value of item information. (Contains 6 tables and 6 figures.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Using some recent studies of trust done by scholars in organizational science and related fields, this paper attempts to identify models and constructs that could prove useful to educators looking for ways to encourage successful collaborative partnerships, especially those that include processions from K-12 and university settings. The paper examines the social organization of trust and describes the ecological arrangements within which trust occurs (or does not occur) in the context of school/university collaborations. The study looks at the relationships among the social actors in a partnership that connects the faculty, staff, and students of a large public high school with the instructor and students involved in a general methods course (n=16) at a small, private, liberal  arts college. Findings suggest that a predisposition to trust, responsibility in following through with one's obligations, and a willingness to allow for minor indiscretions provide a basis for increased cooperation and further development. The study also highlights the rich body of literature on trust that is being produced by theorists in the organizational sciences. (Contains 55 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Stakeholders and practitioners are concerned about the extent to which standardized achievement tests are meeting the general and specific purposes they were designed to achieve. Several empirical studies have been conducted to this end. This study reviews this research to determine current trends in teachers' and school administrators' perspectives and uses of standardized achievement tests. In the first step of this review, literature on teachers' and school administrators' perspectives and the uses of standardized tests was searched in  the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) database. The second step was the selection of relevant studies. The final step involved reading and analyzing the full text of the studies. The review shows that the current attitude of  classroom teachers toward standardized achievement tests appears to be negative, although administrators have more positive attitudes. Teachers use standardized achievement test results on a limited scale to make educational decisions, using the tests mainly to confirm or supplement the information they already have about their students. Administrators find standardized test results very useful, especially for curricular evaluation, communication with parents, and evaluation of school effectiveness. Recommendations for test use resulting from these findings include greater localization of state-mandated tests. School administrators should not use standardized tests to assess school effectiveness. Further studies of the perceptions and uses of standardized tests are needed. (Contains 162  references.)

The study used a variety of methods, including the Self-Regulated Learning Interview Schedule and the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey, to elucidate the self-regulated learning strategies and achievement goal orientations of these students. The self-regulated learning strategies used most often were seeking, organizing, and transforming information,  seeking social assistance from teachers, and goal-setting and planning. Less often used were rehearsing and memorizing, self-evaluation, and record-keeping and monitoring. With regard to achievement goal orientation, these students were most oriented toward developing new skills, the intrinsic value of learning, developing their understanding, and improvement. Findings suggest that self-regulated learning strategy use may be affected by motivation goal orientation. Also, some differences were noted between the two classes with respect to task orientation.

Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 10 teachers, 2 administrators, 4 parents, and 6 students. Themes related to the roles and demands of Celebration teachers were identified. Working in teams was the first theme identified. All teachers and administrators discussed the importance of the dynamics of teaching teams. A second major theme was that of the rewards and frustrations of the school's approach and the learner-centered environment. The  relationships of teachers and parents was a third theme consistently identified. Celebration School faces many challenges in initiating and maintaining its reforms, especially in the number of simultaneous innovations, the team and open space structure, and the high profile these efforts have generated. Faculty members are sometimes frustrated by the demands placed on them, and it is essential that Celebration find ways to support the teachers and to communicate the school's mission to parents.

The narrative provides a picture of the philosophical foundation and direction that the school's founders intended it to take. The community is a new town in which all homes have been prewired for technology. The school is divided into upper and lower school neighborhoods, with neighborhoods containing K-5 students on the first floor, and 6-12 neighborhoods on the second floor. Classrooms are referred to as neighborhoods where a community of learners work, create, and discover together. In each  neighborhood, approximately 100 multiage students are taught by 4 to 5 full-time teachers, a teaching assistant, and many adult volunteers. The school's philosophy stresses that everyone can learn, and that experiential learning is essential. Emphasis is placed on solving real-life problems, and students are considered partners in the learning process. Cooperative learning is important at Celebration, and the educational environment acknowledges students' multiple intelligences. The local community and the world are explored as part of the learning environment. Other characteristics of the school are described. (Contains 21 references.) (SLD)",

        "author":["Jasman, Anne M."],
        "description":"In 1997, the Education Department of Western Australia, in conjunction with the teachers' union, initiated a trial project to establish a career path for teachers. Standards are to be set for the career path for three stages: (1) entry to Level 1; (2) transition from Level 1 to 2; and (3) transition from Level 2 to 3. This paper discusses the research undertaken to establish professional competency standards for the transition from Level 2 to Level 3. The first issue is how to group or categorize teachers. When analysis of a sample of teaching portfolios suggested that establishing categories similar to those used by the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards was not appropriate, alternative groupings were generated based on teachers' descriptions of their context,  philosophy, and professional practice. The second issue relates to setting the &quot;standard.&quot; As part of the selection process for Level 3, 40 elementary and 40 secondary school teaching portfolios were assessed on the quality of the evidence presented to demonstrate achievement of each of five competencies. Teaching portfolios rated equivalently were analyzed to see if there was any consistency in the professional practices of these teachers. This analysis generated a &quot;standard&quot; for each band of ratings that was then used in determining the appropriate level of professional expertise needed to achieve Level 3 Classroom Teacher status. These issues are discussed in relation to current understandings of the description and assessment of competencies, the development of professional expertise,  and standard setting.

        "description":"This policy brief presents an in-depth look at the dropout issue in Texas in the context of 1986 state legislation that mandated that the schools and state education agency ensure that at least 95 % of Texas youth complete high school. Findings from a study by the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA), using a high school attrition formula and the review and analysis of secondary data, suggested that 86,000 students had not graduated from Texas public high schools that year. By 1998, the estimated cumulative number of dropouts was much higher, at more than 1.2 million, and study findings show that 43% of the 1993-94 freshman class did not graduate in what should have been their senior year. The costs to the state in foregone income, lost tax revenue, and direct  costs of the criminal justice and welfare systems have been enormous. The student attrition rate was highest in major urban districts (51%) and lowest in rural districts (28%). Racial and ethnic minority group students were more likely to be lost from public school enrollment than were White nonHispanic students. The Texas Education Agency has reported much lower dropout rates, suggesting that in 1996-97, only 9.1% (estimated longitudinal rate) did not graduate. One of the recommendations coming from this study is that state and district dropout reporting be made more accurate. Other recommendations center on modifying definitions and policy requirements to reflect the realities of the situation, and establishing monitoring, reporting, and prevention activities at the local school district level.

        "description":"In 1997, conservative Texas lawmakers introduced a measure for a state-funded voucher program, which was to be limited to low-income students in the state's lowest performing schools. The real objective of the proposal was to set state precedents for state subsidies for private schools. This proposal never made it out of committee in the Texas Senate, but supporters promised to try again in 1999. This policy brief explores the use of vouchers and their effects. State courts have been inconsistent in rulings regarding the constitutionality of using public funds for private schools, which are not accountable to the public for their actions or results. In addition, diverting money for private schools takes money away from communities, resulting in higher taxes. Vouchers do not give  parents a choice as much as they give private schools a choice about whom to accept. There is no extensive empirical evidence to support claims that vouchers, by creating competition, improve the quality of local public schools. In Texas, the private schools do not have the capacity to absorb large numbers of students. Vouchers give a new government subsidy to private schools and wealthy parents with children already in private schools. The Intercultural Development Research Association recommends that public monies be used solely for the support of public schools, and that all students should have access to community-based, equitably-funded, high-quality public schools. Schools that receive state tax monies should be subject to the admissions and reporting requirements applicable to  public schools. (Contains 1 table, 3 graphs, and 50 references.) (SLD)",

In-grade retention has been a recurrent theme in education over the last 30 years, and it is currently linked to calls for higher standards by politicians. It is often seen as the only alternative to social promotion, passing students with the age-appropriate cohort. Of 66 studies done from 1990 to 1997, 65 found in-grade retention to be ineffective or actually harmful. Retained students suffer low self-esteem and are not likely to make up academic deficiencies. African American and Hispanic students are retained at twice the rate of Whites, and 40% of grade repeaters  come from the lowest socioeconomic quartile. In-grade retention is increasing in Texas, especially for minority and economically disadvantaged students. The highest retention rates are found in urban school districts. The Intercultural Development Research Association has developed some recommendations for addressing issues related to in-grade retention in Texas. These include early identification of students at risk, professional development for teachers, redesign of school structures to provide more support, and establishment of new criteria for determining whether or not students should be promoted.

Findings show that, for the most part, these alternative educational programs are being used as dumping grounds for &quot;undesirable&quot; students who, once there, get little support. Minority students are overrepresented in removals to these programs, and there has been an increase in reports from schools that have classified students' race and ethnicity as &quot;unknown.&quot; Anecdotal reports of some exceptional programs exist, but there are no conclusive studies on the effectiveness of such programs for students  forced to participate. Recommendations from the Intercultural Research Development Association are that the decision to refer a student to such a program be made in conjunction with the student's parents, with all options clearly explained. Better information should be gathered about the effectiveness of existing programs, and the alternative programs should be held to the same standards as other Texas schools. In addition, school districts should not be allowed to operate programs that combine students from elementary, middle, and high school levels. (Contains 20 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Recent reports have confirmed that boys, not girls, are increasingly on the unfavorable side of the gender gap in education and developmental matters. This paper provides an analysis of trends in the gender gap among students in Catholic and public schools during the period from 1972 to 1992 for a select set of variables. Although the gender gap on test scores has received considerable attention in recent years, Catholic/public school comparisons have not been made, and very little attention has been given to variables other than test scores. Data are from three national surveys of high school students, the National Longitudinal Study (1972), the High School and Beyond Study (1980), and the National Educational Longitudinal Study (1992). The gender gap across Catholic, single  sex, and coeducational schools is also considered, as well as several important demographic trends in Catholic schools. There is no evidence for a one-way gender gap favoring males beyond 1992 in either Catholic or public schools. As of that time, females possess an advantage on most central educational outcome indicators, on average. Movement towards this 1992 state of affairs can be observed in the trend results as early as 1980. At the same time, females have lost a gender gap advantage that they previously held on two other variables that are indirectly related to educational outcomes. All of this suggests that the broad nationwide efforts to bring about gender equity in schools has been effective. As a result of these trends, however, boys rather than girls are now on the short end  of the gender gap in many school outcomes. Two appendixes describe the national survey data sets and list the variables studied. (Contains 8 figures, 3 tables, and 55 references.) (SLD)",

The tactic was used in a crime-plagued area of Los Angeles, California, that had experienced a high level of drive-by shootings, gang homicides, and street assaults. The program, Operation Cul de Sac (OCDS), was evaluated as a crime reduction tactic. In its 2 years of operation, OCDS did appear to reduce crime. The number of homicides and street assaults fell significantly during the program's operation and rose after the program ended. The street closure did not appear to affect property crime, only violence. Crime was not displaced to other areas. The success of the initiative suggests that traffic barriers can be part of an approach to maximize the  defensible space of neighborhood residents by increasing their span of control. (SLD)",

It pinpoints the differences between youth gangs and adult criminal organizations and examines the risk factors that lead to youth gang membership. Some promising strategies being used to curb youth gang involvement are reviewed. The proliferation of youth gangs since 1980 has fueled the public's fears and magnified possible misconceptions about juvenile gangs. The composition of youth gangs is changing as smaller, less structured gangs are emerging, and drug gangs are becoming more prominent. Gang violence has increased, and most of it seems to be associated with conflicts with other gangs, rather than gang-related drug sales. A key issue in combating youth gangs is providing a uniform definition for them.  Youth gangs and adult criminal organizations have different origins and they serve different purposes. Efforts to develop long-term interventions must take these differences into account. (Contains 187 references.) (SLD)",

Recently there have been hopeful signs that the national levels of youth violence and victimization have peaked and are beginning to decline, but new generations of children are at increased risk of becoming SVJ offenders because policymakers do not have the information, resources, or motivation to change the odds. The findings of the Study Group provide evidence to back their claim that it is never too early to prevent SVJ offenses and never too  late to intervene to stop these.

The project attempted to study the relationships between refugee parents and education professionals in order to identify factors that encourage or hinder the strengthening of home-school contact and communication. The research involved a study of four primary (elementary) schools in two inner-city districts in two large cities. Data were collected from parents, teachers, and others about the relationship between home and school. The analytical framework that is used in the paper focuses on models of school-community relationships and the role of the headteacher in determining the  particular ethos of each school. School practices and teacher attitudes are described, and the issues are considered in the context of recent public sector reforms, particularly in education policy and practice. Findings show that the social, political, and economic context in which refugee families exist is enormously disabling. Emphasizing flexibility and the permeability of home-school boundaries would help address the concerns refugee parents have over the educational futures of their children. (Contains 50 references.)

An effective juvenile justice system must meet the three objectives of holding the juvenile offender accountable, enabling the offender to become a capable and productive citizen, and ensuring the safety of the community. To ensure that juvenile justice interventions are swift, certain, and consistent, the system must contain elements that: (1) include a mechanism for comprehensively assessing a juvenile; (2) have the capacity to provide a range of treatment services; and (3) incorporate increasingly severe sanctions and enhanced treatment services. Critical components include preadjudicated detention, graduated  sanctions for adjudicated delinquents, and quality case management and service integration.

The survey sampled approximately 8,000 women and 8,000 men, providing comparable data on women's and men's experiences with violent victimization. Study findings provide empirical data on the prevalence and incidence of rape, physical assault, and stalking, as well as information on intimate partner violence and differences in the prevalence of rape and physical assault on women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Physical assault was found to be widespread among U.S. women, with 52% of those surveyed reporting physical assault in their lives, and 1.9 reporting physical assault in the last 12 months. Racial and ethnic differences  were significant, with Native American women the most likely to report rape and physical assault victimization. Women experienced more partner violence, were more likely to be injured during an assault, and were more likely to have been stalked.

The 13 sites were purposely selected to provide a broad sampling from three standpoints: (1) major livelihood and form of economic activity (farming, fishing, urban poor, disaster areas); (2) ethnolinguistic grouping (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao); and (3) lifestyle or rhythm of life in the community (traditional, transitional, Moslem Filipino minority, lowland Christian majority, urban poor, developmental). The sample functional literacy rate in the study's communities ranged from 34.4% to 79.8%. Special attention was paid to the following topics: community life as a context of literacy practice; community  knowledge and the passage to a literate tradition; different practices, meanings, and definitions of functional literacy in different contents; constraints in the relationship between literacy and development; and possibilities for literacy in conceptualizing a school of the people. The study demonstrated that the concepts of literacy and numeracy cannot be separated from their social and cultural settings and that standard measures of literacy used in industrialized countries are often inappropriate in other nations.

        "description":"The workshop, \"Adult Learning, Democracy, and Peace,\" had the important role of examining the relationship among adult learning, democracy, citizenship, gender, civil society, and a culture of peace. The speakers expressed a variety of opinions on the issue of globalization. Some rejected it as aggravating existing social tensions and inequalities and as leading to increased marginalization, while others partially acknowledged that globalization offers fresh possibilities and opportunities. Speakers discussed the following topics: adult learning strategies that are required to meet democratic aspirations and foster a culture of peace; understanding the local, the national, and the global stages and the tensions among them; adult learning for democracy; gender justice; moving from  cultural confrontation to intercultural communication; adult learning for an active civil society; adult learning for gender democracy; pedagogical challenges for promoting democracy and a culture of peace; and pedagogical exercises dealing with conflict situations and reconciliation.

The booklet begins with an introduction and overview of the current situation of indigenous peoples throughout the world, including recent changes in thinking with regard to indigenous peoples. Three approaches to human rights for indigenous peoples are considered: the concept of universal human rights; the system of protection of minorities within existing states; and peoples' rights to self-determination. The following four pillars of learning with regard to indigenous peoples are explored: (1) learning to be (the right to self-identification and self-definition); (2) learning to know  (the right to self-knowledge); (3) learning to do (the right to self-development); and (4) learning to live together (the right to self-determination). The six recommendations for follow-up that conclude the booklet include calls for the following: (1) making basic educational competencies in indigenous languages and in the national and global languages of communication a fundamental entitlement; (2) including bilingual intercultural education in national adult learning systems; (3) having indigenous peoples participate in the design of adult learning opportunities and materials; and (4) addressing indigenous peoples' cultural heritage and histories in curricula.

The following issues and challenges facing universities are considered: inequalities within universities; the need for universities to open their doors to a broader range of adults; community needs; and economic needs. The next several sections cite examples of university adult education programs in various countries and illustrate how different countries are doing the following: defining the concept of university-based adult and continuing education; redefining universities' role in view of economic and technological changes;  responding to the unique needs of different groups of adult learners, including members of indigenous populations; seeking to attract more students from minority groups and to increase their emphasis on community-based learning; conducting and sharing the results of community-based research; and developing partnerships with industry and business. The examples presented are drawn from South Africa, Australia, the United States, and Norway. Concluding the booklet are overviews of the dilemmas posed for university education by economic and social changes and the need to &quot;mainstream&quot; university adult learning. (MN)",

        "description":"This booklet, which was produced as a follow-up to the Fifth International Conference on Adult Education, examines the politics and policies of the education of adults in a globally transforming society. After a brief overview of the three-part workshop from which the booklet emerged, the following issues and challenges facing adult education within the context of global economic transformation are considered: the diminishing validity of the old paradigm of development as an endless upward path; transformation in former socialist countries; transformations in work; processes of democratization throughout the world; and erosion of the nation state. Discussed in an examination of the crucial role of adult learning in addressing the key issues confronting societies are the following  topics: promoting political skills and active citizenship; networking among adult learning initiatives; new roles for adults that require higher level competencies; a broader view of adult learning; and policy strategies. The following are among the points made in the booklet's conclusion: (1) the present global transformation is far from being an equitable and sustainable development; (2) the issues confronting adult educators are structural, legislative, and distributive rather than technical or curricular; (3) local experiences should guide practice and policy; (4) sharing experiences and learning from others are increasingly important.

After a brief overview of the workshop from which the booklet emerged, the need to reconceptualize literacy as a tool for learning throughout life is emphasized. Discussed next are the following: the sharp differences between literacy rates in industrialized and developing countries and the relationship between illiteracy and other aspects of human and social development; literacy rates and literacy education trends and needs in Africa, the Arab States, and Latin America; lessons learned from large-scale literacy programs; the role of local communities, associations, and businesses in making literacy education a component  of local development; and strategies for using literacy education to improve the situation of women and to help them gain responsibility and autonomy. The following are among the points made in the booklet's conclusion: (1) practitioners must be trained to recognize the problems in development; (2) development agencies and educators must understand each other's language; (3) institutions and structures must be created in the context of initiatives; (4) the human, financial, and institutional capital elements of local development must be emphasized; and (5) literacy must be imparted in the local and national languages before being imparted in global languages.

After a brief overview of the workshop from which the booklet emerged, the new convivial approaches to literacy that are being developed through experimentation in many developing countries are described. The learner- and community-based approaches fuse literacy and empowering processes through a single, well-structured participatory methodology. Presented next is a discussion of the importance of basic needs and productive work support that advocates the following: (1) developing activities that respect local knowledge, promote on-the-job training, and relate to people's contexts and cultures; (2) developing an understanding of the  pedagogy of the informal sector; and (3) using an integrated approach linking competencies for economic survival with the social equipment for greater effectiveness at the local level. Concluding the booklet are the following four steps toward putting participatory ideology into action: (1) decentralize the creation of books and programs; (2) promote basic learning needs through nonformal strategies; (3) recognize that in addition to reading and counting skills, adults also need functional skills to be self-reliant and productive in local economic development; and (4) promote communities' own knowledge and learning traditions.

        "description":"Literacy is embedded in social practice and has social meanings. Research and practice in adult literacy are demonstrating that, in order to bring about cultural and social transformation, literacy must be seen as an activity embedded in social and cultural practice. The traditional paradigm, which considers literacy as input for development and tends to see literacy primarily in terms of measurable literacy skills to be attained and the numbers to be made literate, must be replaced by a new paradigm based on the assumption that even small communities can begin their own process of literacy and make it part of the fabric of their own way of life. The notion of societal literacy is central to the new paradigm. The extent to which a community uses literacy as an integral part of  life varies greatly, depending on the local, national, and international contexts. In the future, literacy provision must reflect the specific and diverse contexts in which literacy is acquired and used. These contexts include the following: what learners already know, want, and bring to the learning experience; learners' mother tongue; learners' identities in terms of gender, class, religion, and race; and learners' social, economic, and cultural contexts.

        "description":"Although adult literacy programs exist in almost every country throughout the developing world, comprehensive information on their capacity, performance, and impact is seriously lacking. This deficiency has direct consequences for the effectiveness of developing countries' national literacy education policies. Reasons for the lack of data include the popular character of adult literacy programs with their grassroots, bottom-up, participatory approach and the fact that, in some countries, the private sector has taken over adult literacy. The knowledge base on adult literacy programs must be improved and broadened to enable policymakers and donor agencies to understand literacy programs' context, grasp learners' needs, and discuss programs' effectiveness and relevance by capturing  the continuum of literacy abilities that goes beyond the simplistic literacy/illiteracy dichotomy. Effective monitoring and evaluation are needed to ensure the quality of adult literacy programs. The International Adult Literacy Survey is a good demonstration of how to use the best of education assessment technology to gather data on a broad range of individual literacy skills and examine basic skills from a continuum or scale perspective. In assessing requests for assistance, donor agencies are interested in research, evaluation, and statistics regarding the planning and implementation of adult literacy programs. (MN)",

        "description":"Because of the significant political implications of first and second language policy, many decision-makers have been reluctant to review language policy in the context of literacy work. Issues that must be considered include the following: whether mother tongue literacy should be a precondition for introduction of a second language in school-based and nonformal settings; conditions under which mother tongue literacy should precede second language literacy; and effects of policies regarding language of instruction on literacy after schooling. In Latin America, the value of native languages and cultures is recognized; the value of culture in bilingual literacy is promoted; and local languages and cultures are being integrated into the educational process. In Africa, on the other  hand, African languages are in grave danger, and extra support for them is needed in the schools. Among the issues that must be addressed when imparting language skills in a global language of communication are the following: learners should immediately experience the applicability of their newly acquired language skills; development of simple language units requires cooperation in international research; new didactics and methods must be developed that give equal consideration to everyday use of the language of communication and learning environments outside the school system.

        "description":"Although technology is not the answer to all educational problems, it is proving to be a useful tool in improving the quality and efficiency of literacy provision in the formal, nonformal, and informal education sectors. Adopting technology demands a selection process for determining which technology is appropriate, by and for whom it will be used, and for what kind of communication and content. It is important to view technology in the wider political, social, and economic context rather than merely in terms of hardware and software packages. Principles in planning the integration of technology into literacy programs include the following: depart from existing strategies and structures; focus on affordability of initial investments in setting up systems; include a training  program on using technology; and be flexible about time schedules. Television, radio, computers, and the Internet can all be important tools for facilitating lifelong and lifewide learning. Technology often raises the fear of inequality. Analysis of experiences with educational technology appears to indicate that, although it may initially widen the gap between those with and without access, it holds great potential for making adult and literacy education more affordable and accessible to broader audiences.

        "description":"A review of past trends in adult literacy in developing countries shows that the following factors have been crucial to achieving large-scale literacy results: the state as the prime mover; political will or national commitment; a favorable development context; continuous mobilization activities; a broad conception of literacy; broad collaborative involvement; central coordination; postliteracy and other follow-up efforts; and dual strategy combining universal primary education and adult literacy. Despite the arguments against large-scale adult literacy campaigns by nongovernmental organizations and international agencies, well-resourced, well-planned initiatives have taken place in Latin America, Africa, and India. Learner- and community-based approaches are becoming more  popular; however, the World Bank's policies regarding adult literacy have had a detrimental effect on efforts to link adult and child literacy through intergenerational approaches. Although the need for literacy teaching is greatest in developing countries, literacy remains a concern in industrialized countries. The literacy of tomorrow should not be a static condition inasmuch as the level of literacy required to function in everyday life is constantly shifting upward. The challenge is to provide citizens with lifelong access to literacy and learning-rich environments. Meeting this challenge requires removing the word &quot;remedial&quot; from the literacy vocabulary and coordinating hitherto separate fields of education. (MN)",

        "description":"This booklet reflects issues raised at a workshop on women's education and empowerment held at the Fifth International Conference on Adult Education. It focuses on promoting empowerment for women in educational contexts ranging from formal education systems to literacy and poverty alleviation programs. Section 1 discusses two perspectives on women's empowerment: one that advocates improving women's position and equity without radically altering the existing structure of gender relations and another that sees women's advancement as necessarily involving the transformation of an excessively male-dominated society. Section 2 focuses on how educational opportunity is not necessarily translated into personal, social, and economic gains for Caribbean women. Section 3 uses the women's  program, Mahila Samakhya, implemented in the Banda district of India, as an example of empowering women through participatory adult learning. Section 4 deals with new radical discourses in adult literacy work dealing with the issues of violence and creating safe adult learning environments for women. Section 5 highlights the following challenges for adult learning: (1) giving a voice to women who have suffered violent experiences; (2) informal learning; (3) the learner's role in determining the curriculum; (4) breaking discrimination barriers; and (5) connecting formal and nonformal systems of women's adult education within the perspective of lifelong learning.

        "description":"This booklet reviews the current situation of women's education in different formal and nonformal educational settings, in different regions and contexts. Section 1 looks at the continuing gender gap in educational participation. It discusses the following reasons for the imbalance in South Asia: (1) little attention is paid to implementing reforms; and (2) tensions between the allocation of a special status to gender issues and the integration of these issues into adult education. The following reasons are cited for Africa: (1) literacy programs are not linked to women's and girls' multiple roles outside the educational field; (2) insufficient attention is given to social and cultural barriers; (3) poor curricula; (4) inadequate textbooks; (5) ill-trained teachers; and (6) badly  managed programs. Section 2 stresses the need for strong advocacy for the girls' and women's education movement. Section 3 focuses on adult education in nonformal settings and uses the Women's Institute in Chile as an example of an organization in which adult learning deals with women's issues in an interdependent and interdisciplinary way. Section 4 emphasizes that adult education should recognize the experiences of women at the local level, taking into account the forces of globalization that are creating more competitive relations among people, groups, nations, and regions. Section 5 discusses the importance of subjectivity in adult learning. (YLB)",

Section 1 deals with the most significant changes taking place in the world of work, including globalization; technological innovations; changing employment patterns; and the changing organization of work. Section 2 discusses work-related adult learning and considers investment in adult learning of workers as essential for competitiveness and growth and considers adult learning as an important commodity that is capable of making a profit. Section 3 addresses how a system of adult learning linked to the informal sector would sustain its development Section 4 focuses on the following three issues at stake  in diversification and reform of national training systems: (1) devising flexible and continuous adult learning and training systems to meet the learning requirements of the entire labor market and all active populations; (2) mobilizing greater investment by building partnerships; and (3) ensuring equitable access to adult continuing education.

Section 3 defines health promotion, which builds on a social and cultural understanding of health and illness, as the process of enabling people to increase control over their health through advocacy and intersectoral action; health education as a component of health promotion; and community action  as a key component of health promotion policies. Section 4 discusses the closeness between health education and adult learning as reflected in the similarity of goals and principles that characterize both contemporary adult education and health promotion policies. Section 5 focuses on health as a basic human right. Section 6 defines health literacy.

Section 1 discusses reproductive rights in the post-Cairo context and the key role adult education should play in providing women and men with the information about their options and in empowering them to make reproductive choices. Section 2 addresses how reproductive choices and information available will be conditioned by different cultural contexts and, in particular, by different belief systems. Section 3 stresses that the subject of sexuality should be treated as private and  confidential in the adult learning context. Section 4 focuses on the relationship between men and women and emphasizes that women's empowerment is crucial.

Recommendations made by workshop participants include the following: (1) governments should not reduce their support for social and cultural public services; (2) all countries should be not merely consumers but also producers of software; (3) software and courses should reflect national and local  identities as well as cultural requirements; (4) new technologies and conventional ones should be integrated; and (5) the dissemination and use of information technology should be open to public debate.

The booklet presents an overview of how museums and libraries offer different types of educational opportunities for adults. Most museums have pedagogical programs, including gallery talks, lectures, guided tours, and publications for distribution. In addition, visitors can engage in individual informal learning by touring the museum alone. Museums and libraries also offer structured courses and partner with schools to provide longer-term educational opportunities for adults as well for traditional-age students. The booklet concludes that museums and libraries are special sites of learning that  offer open-ended learning situations that can provide a range of meaningful experiences for adults. The following recommendations are made to enhance and bring to the fore the contributions of museums and libraries to adult education: (1) such institutions need to be strengthened and appropriately funded in order to develop as adult learning resources; and (2) the conservation and use of cultural heritage as a lifelong learning resource needs to be promoted and methods and techniques for strengthening heritage and cultural learning need to be developed.

Despite the differences in the  five authors' approaches, they describe a consciousness that is: (1) capable of developing a more inclusive world view and forming allegiances beyond the local; (2) cognizant of the interdependence among humans and between humankind and the earth; (3) able to cope comfortably with ambiguity; and (4) able to value complexity and diversity. All five authors call for changes in the way humans think, the way humans relate to the rest of the world, and the way humans identify with all of humanity. Study of these authors leads to building a curriculum for a new consciousness. (KC)",

A 10% random sample of 1,510 New York State customers (n=151) of a large multinational opticianry corporation was surveyed. Two categories of data were social background (combined annual family income, age, marital status, race, gender) and a locally constructed five-item Guttman scale selected to differentiate attitude toward optical training. The scale consisted of future-oriented questions about the individuals' future eye care exposure to apprenticeship-trained opticians and present-oriented questions about current educational requirements within the optician profession. Statistical analyses included descriptive percentage data extracted for cross-tabulation,  Pearson correlation, and linear regression models for prediction and causal explanations. Findings indicated customer attitude toward optician training was in favor of higher educational requirements and credentials for all social background indicators; confidence level in the eye care professional increased as the optician's educational achievement increased; 100 percent would be more confident in the optician's skills if he/she were college educated; and 81 percent believed an optician should have earned at least a baccalaureate degree.

        "description":"Since the 1970s, federal legislation and public and private sector initiatives have attempted to increase the numbers of women employed in occupations considered nontraditional for females. In 1998, women accounted for 20-25% of employees in a handful of nontraditional occupations (NTOs) but less than 10% of employees in many other NTOs. Secondary vocational enrollments remain largely gender segregated, and although enrollment of women in postsecondary education has increased overall, the numbers of women remain small in many program areas. Reasons for this limited progress in increasing the numbers of women preparing for NTOs include the following: Perkins equity and single-parent/displaced homemaker grants have been small and few in number; equity remains a low priority and is  not adequately addressed in teacher education; and appropriations for equity provisions in some legislation are minimal or nonexistent. The greatest increase of women in NTOs has been in professions; however, most women (73%) remain in nonprofessional occupations. Some barriers to increasing the number of women in NTOs remain impervious to the legislative and educational remedies attempted over the past 3 decades. To succeed, efforts to boost the numbers of women in NTOs must be institutionalized rather than simply viewed as add-ons, and corrective measures should address the wider sociocultural issues that constitute the greatest barriers.

Other keys to workplace success include continuous learning, emotional intelligence, networking, flexibility, and commitment to business objectives. Although academic degrees, skill certifications, and other documentation of accomplishments provide access to employment, they are significant only at the time of the job offer and its acceptance. Continuous learning is the key to ensuring ongoing employment. More keys to employment success include the following: interpersonal and social skills; listening and persuasion skills; ability to get along with others; ability to make one's talents and accomplishments known; and courteousness and respectfulness toward everyone. To some extent, it is true that it's who you know that counts.  The key to knowing the right people is knowing how to network (in other words, meeting people and drawing upon those contacts to further your career). Two important networking strategies are the following: (1) learn about and select networking events to attend; and (2) linking with a mentor who can serve as a guide or adviser. Although some anticipation is necessary to be ready for various career junctures, speculating on work demands and outcomes rather than asking supervisors directly about their expectations is a stress enhancer.

The literature that speaks directly to the adult educator's role is scanty. A larger body of literature exists, however, that either alludes to adult educators' roles or contains information from which ideas about their roles can be surmised. One clear trend in the literature on roles is a connection between philosophical beliefs about adult education and the type of role described. For example, publications can be found that do the following: support the radical tradition in education; explore adult educator roles for a civil society; and examine adult educator roles in experiential learning. A related issue is  the question of how adult educators perceive their roles versus how roles are described in the literature. Among other related topics addressed in the literature are the following: suggested future roles of adult educators; markets that adult educators could tap in reshaping their roles; and information about careers in the future that adult educators can use to either shape their roles or develop programs and services for learners.

        "description":"According to the theory of multiple intelligences (MI), intelligence is a set of abilities, talents, and skills in eight areas: mathematical-logical, spatial-visual, bodily-kinesthetic, musical-rhythmic, verbal-linguistic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic. All humans possess these intelligences in varying degrees, and most people can develop all of them to a degree of competence. Because the MI theory was formed in part by examining people's performance of jobs and tasks, MI profiling and learning activities should be useful in career choice and career development. The use of MI theory can assist the career development and counseling process in three ways: self-knowledge (awareness of MI strengths and weaknesses adds to the self-knowledge required for successful  career choice); expansion of career possibilities (adults involved in MI activities broadened the parameters of their career choices); and enhancement of self-esteem (at-risk students and adults who may not have experienced career success have benefited from recognizing their intelligence and identifying jobs matching their strengths). Issues in the use of MI include the following: not \"labeling\" people by their preferred intelligences, not matching intelligences to careers too early, and encouraging individuals to develop less-preferred intelligences.

        "description":"Because emotional well-being is increasingly being recognized as a predictor of success in school, family, and work life, many are advocating that emotional intelligence be promoted as early as elementary school. Emotional intelligence involves two competencies important to career success: (1) the ability to recognize personal and others' feelings and emotions; and (2) the ability to use that information to resolve conflicts, solve problems, and improve interactions with others. The academic model that has been embraced by education focuses on cognitive learning or knowledge transfer rather than on the thinking processes that lead to emotional learning and play a big role in career and life success. Educators and organizations alike are recognizing the value of emotional as well  as cognitive development and are increasing training for emotional intelligence. Teachers can facilitate learning by modeling the behavior they expect learners to demonstrate in school and/or on the job. Teaching strategies should address different learning styles and incorporate visual, sensory, auditory, and interactive elements such as role playing, group discussions, and simulations. Self-disclosure, in which instructors share personal stories to communicate how they dealt with an emotion, is especially recommended.

        "description":"New information technologies, changing work force demographics, rising customer expectations, transnational companies, and cost pressures are altering traditional views of what constitutes a workplace and have given rise to a new trend: the mobile worker in the flexible workplace. Two factors promote acceptance of telework or telecommuting: (1) employee flexibility in workspace, time, and productivity; and (2) employer profit margins and cost savings. A mobile work force appeals to employers because it can save money typically spent on office space, computer equipment, travel time, and conflict resolution. Surveillance of teleworkers, however, is a major consideration offsetting these cost benefits. Employers must ensure that the monitoring of teleworkers does not result in  invasion of privacy or in practices that are perceived as negative or resented by employees. Also of key importance is the need for employers to help \"hoteling\" employees cope with feelings of isolation and rootlessness triggered by separation from the onsite work environment. New mobile work arrangements creating the virtual workplace--telecommuting, telework centers, nonterritorial offices, and team space--are changing the way companies and workers do business with each other and with their respective clients.

Since 1990, 47 teams have been formed under the auspices of Common Good, a statewide project to facilitate development of local interagency linkage teams throughout Ohio. Local teams focused on improving services to at-risk youth and adults through development of collaborative interagency linkages. Five teams, representing diversity of locations and methods of operation, were selected: Montgomery, Portage, Scioto, Washington, and Wayne counties. Case studies were organized around developing factors, functioning, and ongoing sustainability of Common Good teams at the local level. Interviews of team members, personal  observations by project staff, and published documents such as newsletter articles, media releases, brochures, and meeting agendas were used as references. Teams shared the following common elements that contributed to successful interagency collaboration: regular communication, customer-centered focus, shared leadership, structure and focus, esprit de corps, relationship to one-stop system, and support from the Common Good State Team. The only common challenge was lack of time. Recommendations were for the State Team's continuing leadership; study of the project's relationship to the one-stop system; a meeting for local teams to share activities; and the State Team's support of continuing study of local collaborative linkage activities in Ohio.

        "description":"Discussions about the importance of technology have permeated every area of the counseling field. How prepared are counselors for changes in technology? How competent are counselors in the use of technology? Who will provide the training? This study attempts to address some of these issues. It is designed to assess how competent counselors are in the technology skills they will require their students to possess. A survey based on The Technology Interest Network of the Association for Counselor Education and Supervision (ACES) set of 12 competencies that counselors should have upon graduation was published in the Spring 1999 issue of &quot;Spectrum.&quot; Because persons other than counselor educators responded, the results may have limited generalizability to the membership of ACES. Survey  results indicate that counselor educators and counseling students lack a uniformly high level of technology competence. Given the likely possibility that primarily &quot;technology-interested&quot; individuals completed the survey, the results probably overestimate the actual levels of technology competence among counselor educators and students. As the impetus for advanced technology continues, it will be important to address both pre- and in-service preparation that will enhance needed technology competence in the counseling field.

        "description":"This study investigates the controversy over whether or not culture has an effect on child and adolescent psychopathology. It presents the two opposing positions held in the field. The &quot;universalists&quot; argue that child and adolescent psychopathology is significantly similar across cultures. The &quot;culturalists&quot; argue that culture is a strikingly important factor when it comes to psychopathology. The study suggests that more cross-cultural studies of child and adolescent psychopathology are needed to make definite conclusions about the debate among the researchers since both sides are right to some degree. It suggests that the debate may not be a valid topic because some psychopathology can have a strong biological base and another psychopathology can have strong cultural influences.  In addition, culture is too vague and global an area to study because it includes religion, community, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Before studies in culture could be conclusive, the topic would have to be described in more specific terms (i.e., religion or region). The paper concludes with some recommendations for successful multicultural therapy. Open-mindedness and cultural empathy are essential. Cultural empathy can be accomplished in three processes: knowing the background of the client, sensitively sharing the pain of the client, and expressing genuine concern and care for the client.

        "description":"This report presents the collective results of studies funded under the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention congressional directive. The studies confirm that young African-American males are disproportionately involved as offenders and victims of violence, that firearms play a large role in juvenile violence, and that gang members are frequently involved in violence. The studies also show that although many juvenile offenders live in impoverished and high-crime areas, the majority of youth who live in such environments are not involved in serious delinquency. Recommendations emphasize four major areas of intervention: gangs, guns, high-risk juveniles, and locations and times of highest risk for juvenile violence. Examples of programs that address each area are  provided. It is argued that the findings from these studies provide additional evidence that violence is taking an alarming toll on minority communities, particularly urban African-American and Hispanic communities. Consequently, there is a need for concentrated prevention efforts in those inner-city neighborhoods that experience the highest level of juvenile violence. Chapters include &quot;Characteristics and Patterns of At-Risk Juveniles and Factors that Contribute to Violence Committed by or against Juveniles,&quot;&quot;Accessibility of Firearms and the Use of Firearms by or against Juveniles,&quot;&quot;Conditions Associated with an Increase in Violence Committed by or against Juveniles,&quot;&quot;Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Juvenile Violence.&quot; (Contains 43 references.)

        "author":["Coleman, Hardin L. K."],
        "description":"This paper presents an example of a patient treated in a school-based clinic. The counselor used traditional diagnostic perspectives to come up with a diagnosis that would be understood by the patient's Health Maintenance Organization. This diagnosis reflects traditional understanding of mental health and psychological treatment, which promotes the interpretation that mental health is a function of intrapsychic and behavioral factors. Using the medical model, the assumption has been that once the behavioral manifestations of a disorder are determined, then assumptions have to be made about the cause and treatments must be recommended on a normative understanding of the disorder. Increasingly, the mental health establishment has sought, through controlled experimentation, to  determine what treatment protocols work best with which mental health disorders. The case described in this paper highlights the challenges to mental health care professionals' reliance on empirically validated treatment (EVT). To be empirically validated, a treatment needs specific guidelines. The factors that lead to EVT are the very factors that challenge the development of culturally relevant or specific EVTs. As the counselor in this case struggled with assessing and developing a treatment plan for her client, she realized that a traditional diagnosis and treatment plan were insufficient to the client's needs. This paper offers the following four suggestions in regard to EVTs: articulate a theory of culturally relevant treatment, value ecological validity, focus on nonspecific  factors in EVT, and our own values.

Six new trends are described that are emerging and are leading the profession into the future: psychotherapy integration, specialization, managing psychotherapy, expansion of the scope of practice, cultural diversity, and psychotherapy without walls. Psychotherapy integration is described as finding the right therapist for the right problem. Through specialization, psychotherapists can offer a unique skill they have developed. How managed care reform continues to change the psychotherapy profession is discussed and the possibility of expanding the  scope of practice through prescription drug privileges is examined. It is stated that in order for psychotherapists to survive in practice, they must address how to involve diversity in students coming into the practice and diversity among clients using their services. Psychotherapy without walls acknowledges the reality that future interactions between clients and therapists may be in &quot;virtual&quot; time. The conclusion indicates that the profession will be dealing with a revolutionary explosion of new forms and models for training, practice, and research. (Contains 53 references.) (JDM)",

It states that in this process, the development of the hardiness approach to enhancing performance and health has been facilitated by continual cross-fertilization between theorizing, research, and practice. It first emerged from individual differences research on stress reactions as the attitudes of commitment, control, and challenge. Since then, the impetus of combing research and practice has led to the supplementation of hardy attitudes with hardy skills concerning coping, social interaction, relaxation, nutrition, and physical exercise. Also, the role of and mechanisms whereby hardy attitudes and skills enhance performance and health are better understood. This more  comprehensive picture also involves the expansion of the hardiness approach from the individual to the organization level. As we approach the next century, hardiness will be even more useful. (Contains 4 figures and 40 references.) (JDM)",

A quasi-experimental research design was employed that captured data in three waves from more than 450 students attending 11th grade social studies classes in two schools in the Charlotte-Mecklenberg Public Schools during the 1994-1995 school year. Specific changes were expected in the actual rates of crime and violence; in the overall fear among students, teachers and staff; and in the overall attitudes of participants. Anticipated impacts related to teacher feelings of safety, evaluation of the school and educational environment, and subsequent effects on student performance and the willingness to accept responsibility for one's community were  examined. Project data revealed that the most significant school problems may not be those expected. Although gangs, drugs, and armed agitators may receive the most attention, most of the conflicts during this project concerned everyday school interactions. Data indicates students desire a safer, more orderly school environment. (Author/MKA)",

Based on more than 20 years of research on specific ICPS skills, intervention methods were developed to test the hypothesis that behavior can be modified by focusing on thinking processes rather than the behaviors themselves. The ICPS skills relate to high-risk behaviors that may develop into serious problems such as violence and substance abuse. This approach to childrearing deals with social cognition and social adjustment. Its central theme is that certain interpersonal cognitive thinking skills play a crucial role in the social adjustment of both parent and child; thus it has particular relevance for the primary prevention of later, more serious problems. This bulletin describes intervention methods,  their importance, and their impact as evaluated through research studies. Implementation and policy issues relevant to training and information dissemination are explored. A list of resources for learning more about ICPS is provided. (Contains 51 references.) (MKA)",

        "description":"Although in-depth, long-term group psychotherapy is a beneficial therapeutic experience for adolescent females suffering from anorexia nervosa, these clients are notoriously resistant to treatment and to long-term, open-ended group settings. This dissidence may stem from a motivational deficiency toward changing their eating patterns and difficulties with interrelational skills. Participating in a psychoeducational group can be a less threatening endeavor than in-depth psychotherapy. Members are not initially expected to share and process their pathological conflicts and cognitions, but to learn accurate information about the dangers of their eating disorder behavior. Because the time-limited, short-term format requires less commitment and seems more likely to result in success,  members are more likely to complete the group sessions. The connections they make about the relationship between their eating behavior and underlying issues combined with the positive experiences related to group belongingness and decreased feelings of isolation may increase the likelihood that members will pursue further in-depth psychotherapy. Therefore, a short-term, psychoeducational group for weight-stabilized individuals with anorexia nervosa is an effective prelude to longer-term approaches. Participating in a psychoeducational group builds initial social and coping skills that prepares and motivates recovering clients for more intense psychotherapy. (Contains 41 references.) (GCP)",

Trauma is defined to include emotional as well as physical experiences and injuries. It is noted that even secondhand exposure to violence can be traumatic and, therefore, all children and adolescents exposed to violence or disaster, even if only through graphic media reports, should be watched for signs of distress. Loss of trust and fear of the event occurring again are seen in many children and adolescents who have been exposed to traumatic events. After violence or a disaster occurs, the family is the first-line resource for helping. Among the things that parents and other adults can do are explain the  episode as well as they are able, encourage the children to express their feelings, let children know that it is normal to feel upset, and allow time for the youngsters to experience and talk about their feelings.

The idea of polarity is based on two halves that originally belonged together to form a whole. These two halves are constantly trying to come together to regain their wholeness. The philosophical view of crisis presented in this paper is that the opposite of crisis is called mental development (development of consciousness). When an individual has been successful in dealing with a crisis, he/she has gone through a process of mental development or has simply learned something that would not have been learned without the crisis. It is impossible to understand the message of a crisis unless a person is involved in one. To be in the middle of a crisis means to be learning something  extraordinary. One must move mentally if one wants to move out of the crisis. From this point of view crisis is one half, and mental development, the other half. This concept is applied to the pedagogy of crisis counseling. Several case examples are discussed, and the work of Viktor Frankl, the initiator of Logotherapy, is also mentioned in relation to crisis counseling. A short discussion of dimensionality, the feeling of being caught in a dead-in with no way out is provided. The paper concludes by reminding readers to become sensitive to what life wants us to do by sending a crisis. (MKA)",

        "description":"This two-volume monograph reports the results of the 24th national survey of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs among American high school seniors, the nineteenth such survey of American college students, and the eighth such survey of eighth- and tenth-grade students. The major purpose of this publication is to develop an accurate picture of current drug use and trends. Given the illicit and illegal nature of most of the phenomena under study and the absence of prevalence data, substantial misconceptions can develop and resources may be misallocated. Throughout this report, the focus in on drug use at the higher frequency levels rather than simply on who has used various drugs. A summary of the findings on trends includes: over more than a decade--from the late 1970s to  the early 1990s--these were very appreciable declines in use of a number of illicit drugs among twelfth-grade students, and even larger declines in their use among American college students and young adults. These substantial improvements--which seem largely explainable in terms of changes in attitudes, beliefs about the risks of drug use, and peer norms against drug use--have some extremely important policy implications. One of these is that these various substance-using behaviors among American young people are malleable--they can be changed. Secondly, the demand-side factors appear to have been pivotal in bringing about these changes. the availability of marijuana, as reported by high school seniors, has held fairly steady throughout the life of the study. Improvements should not be  taken for granted; relapse is always possible. In 1992, eighth graders exhibited a significant increase in annual use of marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogens other than LSD, as well as an increase in inhalant use. In 1993, increases occurred in a number of &quot;gateway drugs&quot;--marijuana, cigarettes, and inhalants. The drug problem requires an ongoing, dynamic response from our society--one that takes into account the continuing generational replacement of our children and the generational forgetting of the dangers of drugs which can occur with that replacement.

This current study, which draws the college sample in the senior year of high school, has considerable advantages for generating a broadly representative sample of the college students to emerge from each graduating cohort. It has &quot;before, during, and after&quot; college measures, which permit the examination of change. It also has similar panel data on the high school graduates who did not attend college. In order for this volume to stand alone, some material from Volume I is repeated. Chapters 2 and 3 in this volume  are the same as Chapters 2 and 3 in Volume I, since one provides an overview of the key findings and the other explains the study's design and procedures.

        "description":"This practicum was designed to help first and second grade students, who had been identified as Division of Youth and Family Service, Pupil Assistance Committee and/or Child Study Team referrals, positively interact with their peers. The four components of the practicum were the systematic teaching of social skills, teacher training, an in-school mentoring program, and increased efforts to improve communication between parent and school personnel. Analysis of the data indicated that the proactive teaching of social skills to students and their respective teachers, combined with a positive mentoring relationship, helped the students learn and practice the necessary skills to enable them to positively interact with their classmates. It reports that regular communication between the  home and the school was essential to the development of an environment of trust, which enabled the writer to have a better understanding of the family dynamics, to develop appropriate interventions, and to help provide resources for these children and their families. Findings indicate that parents and guardians became very supportive of the school and began to reinforce rules and establish consequences at home when their children exhibited poor behavior.

It states that this developmental guidance and counseling program can play a vital role in assisting teachers and other staff in the integration of guidance objectives with their other instructional goals. The guide was developed to provide all Texas students with equal access to developmental guidance and counseling programs. Thus, this guide can serve as a model and an impetus to help implement guidance programs around the state of Texas and elsewhere. It outlines a program development/improvement process that has been successfully implemented in school districts and describes how to tailor the program model to meet  needs of a vast array of public schools. Section I includes background and contextual information about guidance programs and describes the philosophical foundation for guidance programs in Texas. Section II defines the structure of the model and presents recommendations for designing appropriately balanced programs. Section III defines the roles and responsibilities of counselors, including statements about their training, specialized competencies, and appropriate assignments. It also suggests considerations regarding counselor-to-student ratios. Section IV further details scope of the guidance curriculum. Section V outlines a process for implementing the Texas Developmental Guidance and Counseling Program at both district and campus levels. It includes steps to take in planning,  designing, implementing, and evaluating the program. In conclusion, Section VI provides guidelines for evaluating the Texas Developmental Guidance and Counseling Program, including the program as a whole, program improvement, and student growth due to program participation.

        "description":"Traditional diagnosis procedures for Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may lead to over-diagnosis and are fraught with complications because the target behavioral symptoms are found in a variety of other disorders. Traditional treatments consisting of powerful side effect laden psychostimulant drugs and/or complex costly behavioral modification programs are at best symptom focused and palliative in nature. Both diagnostic and treatment advances derived from the neurological basis of the disorder are needed, as are habilitative treatment alternatives. This paper presents the procedural details of Instantaneous Neuronal Activation Procedure (INAP) alert hypnosis as an adjunct to neurotherapy in the treatment of ADD. ADD/ADHD diagnostic  issues, demographics, traditional treatments, neurological basis, EEG assessment, and implications for the use of hypnosis are reviewed. Recent research demonstrating the efficacy and promise of neurotherapy with and without INAP alert hypnosis is discussed. (Contains 54 references.) (MKA)",

        "description":"This paper explores the history of deconstruction and discusses the use of the theories it involves within the author's work in family therapy situations. Jacques Derrida's term, deconstruction, has achieved widespread use among psychotherapists. This derives largely from the influence of Michael White, who has interpreted it in a Foucauldian way consistent with his practice of externalization. Problems are seen as oppressors to be excluded. A return to a Derridean understanding, in which narratives embraced by families to the exclusion of others return as symptoms that eventually hijack the prevailing family story, is proposed. Therapy gives excluded stories a voice by encouraging the acknowledgment of a universal abjection so that the &quot;marginalized other&quot; in all its forms may  be included. Among the case studies presented is the story of a 14-year-old male who was reluctant to attend school. Through a meeting with his family, the author realized that the boy's mother was his only encouraging family member. The author then met with the boy and his mother. By explaining his story of hurt and loss at being forced to move in with his brother to make room for his mother's boyfriend, the boy was able to acknowledge his abjection and move through his problems.

It assessed constructs longitudinally and attempted consolidation of self-efficacy and expectancy-value theories. Self-efficacy perceptions were assessed at varying levels of measurement specificity. Exploratory factor analyses showed self-efficacy items were reliably differentiated into separate factors of a priori specificity. Task-value items were separated into utility and intrinsic value factors. Various self-efficacy factors, except for problem-specific self-efficacy, were positively correlated among themselves and with task-value factors. Path analyses showed that students' midterm scores and enrollment intentions at T1 were better predicted by  task-value factors. However, the typically stronger links of self-efficacy to performance and of task-value to intentions were observed with T2 measures. Utility and interest values displayed slightly different relations with other variables, demonstrating the need to distinguish between multiple value components.

        "description":"Academic self-efficacy beliefs of 204 Korean high school freshmen were solicited in Korean, English, and math by using (a) specific problems, (b) task descriptions, and (c) general statements referring to each domain. Regardless of the assessment specificity, self-efficacy judgments demonstrated certain degrees of generality. Cross-domain correlations were stronger with problem- and task-specific self-efficacy beliefs than with domain-specific perceptions. Magnitude of within-domain correlations between any two self-efficacy measures decreased as the difference in their measurement levels increased. Problem- and task-specific assessments seemed to instigate fairly equivalent competence appraisals, whereas domain-level measures entailed somewhat idiosyncratic estimation. Though  not definitive, some evidence of the need for specificity correspondence and temporal proximity between self-efficacy and performance evaluation was found. Task-specific efficacy beliefs proved more useful compared with the other two self-efficacy measures in predicting temporally distant performances.

        "description":"High schools have traditionally focused on preparing students for entry-level jobs or for postsecondary education. Recently, federal legislation (e.g., 1990 and 1998 Perkins Acts) has encouraged a more integrated approach for all students, one that maintains college entry as a viable option while also providing a stronger foundation in work skills and applications. The percentage of high school graduates who complete both a vocational concentration and a college preparatory curriculum is small, but it increased markedly between 1982 and 1994. This issue brief focuses on students who complete both a vocational and college preparatory curriculum, examining their vocational course taking, academic achievement in high school, and postsecondary participation. High school graduates  with concentrations on vocational areas that use computers most extensively, such as business and technology/communications, generally were most likely to complete a college preparatory curriculum. The academic achievement gains and postsecondary participation rates of high school graduates who completed both a vocational concentration and a college preparatory curriculum were similar to those who completed a college preparatory curriculum only, and generally higher than students who completed a vocational concentration only.

        "description":"Recent research indicates that children exposed to certain risk factors in their families, at school, among their peers, and in their communities are at greater risk of becoming serious violent juvenile (SVJ) offenders. The Study Group on Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders, a group of 22 researchers convened by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to study the population of SVJ offenders, implementing family, school, and community interventions is the best way to prevent children from becoming SVJ offenders. Interventions include strategies that prevent problem behavior or that intervene to reduce future problem behavior. The Study Group also concluded that programs similar in philosophy to public health approaches (i.e., those that both address risk  factors and introduce protective factors) are the most promising prevention and early intervention programs for SVJ offenders. The Study Group examined five types of school interventions: structured playground activities, behavioral consultation, behavioral monitoring and reinforcement, metal detectors, and schoolwide reorganization. Programs monitoring student behavior and reinforcing attendance and academic progress increased positive school behavior and academic achievement, and decreased delinquency. The Study Group also examined eight types of community interventions: citizen mobilization, situational prevention, comprehensive citizen intervention, mentoring, afterschool recreation programs, policing strategies, policy changes, and mass media interventions. Several of these  interventions showed positive results in reducing risk and enhancing protective factors. In studies with long-term follow-up, certain programs were effective in reducing juvenile crime and substance abuse. (Contains 89 references.) (GCP)",

        "description":"This address, based on 10 years of clinical and research experience with immigrant children and their families, discusses the fundamental information that both clinicians and researchers interested in the experiences of immigrant adolescent girls should consider. The various stresses of immigration are detailed, as are the factors that may significantly attenuate the response to the transitions and stress of immigration. Recent research efforts involve collecting data from a variety of sources including structured interviews of immigrant children and adolescents, their teachers and parents; ethnographic fieldwork in the schools and neighborhoods; psychological measures; and school records and achievement tests. While each of these data sets provide important information on their  own, it is maintained that by combining the data and exploring points of convergence and points of divergence, it is possible to address more systematically and more thoroughly the changing experiences of immigrant youth. The model advocated attempts to capture the complexities of changing adaptations by connecting data. The objective is to generate high quality data to develop theoretically robust models, and to delineate how different players involved in the lives of immigrant children come to view their adaptations.

This paper comes out against high-stakes testing, taking the position that the central concern is that testing has become a means of controlling instruction as opposed to a way of gathering information to help students become better readers. The paper, in the form of a question-and-answer dialogue, aims to guide educators who must use tests as a key element in the information base used to make decisions about the progress of individual children and the quality of instructional programs. The paper poses seven questions and provides focused discussions on each question. It also offers recommendations for teachers; researchers; parents, parent groups, and child advocacy  groups; and policymakers. As a frame for these recommendations, the paper stresses two points: (1) accountability is a necessary part of education; and (2) the intent is not to blame policymakers for the current dilemma with high-stakes testing.

The paper first defines a reading method as a set of teaching and learning materials and/or activities often given a label, such as a phonics method, literature-based method, or language experience method. It then advances the position that since there is no single method or single combination of methods that can successfully teach all children to read, teachers must have a strong knowledge of multiple methods for teaching reading and a strong knowledge of the children in their care so they can create the appropriate balance of methods needed for the children they teach. The paper then poses and answers six relevant questions about  supporting research; controversy; methods available for teaching beginning reading; and implications of this position at the federal, state, district, and school levels.

The paper seeks to define phonemic awareness (although there is no single definition), stating that it is typically described as an insight about oral language and in particular about the segmentation of sounds that are used in speech communication. It also differentiates between phonemic awareness and phonological awareness, terms which are sometimes used interchangeably. The paper discusses many aspects of phonemic awareness, including research findings (and how they might be misused or overgeneralized), and how phonemic awareness can be taught. The paper contends that the following teacher suggestions will lead to the development of phonemic awareness and success in learning to read:  offer students a print-rich environment within which to interact; engage students with surrounding print as readers/writers; engage children in language activities that focus on both the form and the content of spoken and written language; provide explicit explanations in support of student's discovery of the alphabetic principle; and provide opportunities for students to practice reading/writing for real reasons in a variety of contexts to promote fluency and independence.

        "description":"A study examined racial/ethnic and gender bias on curriculum-based measurement (CBM) of reading with African-American and Caucasian male and female regular education students across grades 2-5. Simultaneous multiple regression analyses were conducted by grade to examine group differences on CBM as an estimate of reading comprehension. Regression equations were estimated with CBM, gender, race/ethnicity, and the interactions of gender and race/ethnicity with CBM. Results indicated that CBM is a biased indicator of reading comprehension. Although no evidence of bias was found at the second and third grades, intercept bias was found for racial/ethnic groups at the fourth and fifth grades, and intercept and slope bias were found for gender at the fifth grade. Implications suggest  that the meaning of CBM scores differs across race/ethnicity or gender, or both, at certain grade levels. CBM performance over-estimates the reading comprehension of African American students and under-estimates that of Caucasians; and at grade 5, CBM performance overestimates the reading comprehension of girls and under-estimates that of boys. Mean differences between boys and girls were also much greater at lower levels of CBM performance than at higher levels. These findings raise issues concerning the use of CBM as a screening measure and in determining eligibility for and termination of special education and related services. (Author/RS)",

The paper also states that pupils need to achieve well in the affective dimension of objectives, which involve the feeling and emotional aspects of learning. It suggests 10 ways that the teacher can help pupils develop positive attitudes toward the reading curriculum, including: having pupils listen to stories read by the teacher and discuss the subject matter; having a pupil select a library book to read for enjoyment; and allowing pupils in a committee to dramatize content read from a reading selection. The paper also discusses  Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences and how it can be used in reading instruction. Finally, the paper discusses various philosophies of education which can be tied to reading instruction, including idealism, realism, experimentalism, existentialism, perennialism, and the &quot;Big Book&quot; philosophy. The paper concludes that pupils need to experience a match between their own preferences and learning styles with a specific plan of reading instruction. (NKA)",

This book, which contains interviews of practicing community organizers, lays out a step-by-step plan for teachers to adapt the tried-and-true strategies of organizers working in public health, environmental advocacy, and social justice. The book offers teachers and teacher educators a practical, hands-on guide to effecting positive change in their own learning communities and in the larger social community. Expressed in lively, down-to-earth language, the book's model shows teachers how to build on skills they already possess--organizing, collaborating, informing, empowering, and sparking interest and action. It  features numerous real-life examples, scenarios, and adaptable materials from community activists and teachers, and it shows teachers how to think through their own situations to get started at their own pace and create action plans that, in the long run, save time and energy even as they deliver results. Chapters in the book are: (1) Entering the Conversation; (2) The Quiet Revolution: Teachers Reaching out to Parents; (3) An Introduction to Community Organizing; (4) Teachers Are Organizers: Tacit Knowledge and New Techniques; and (5) Putting It All Together: Becoming a Teacher-Organizer.

Textbooks should always be carefully evaluated when new basals are chosen so that the very best one(s) are selected for a class. Committees need to be at work to make the final choices. Each prospective textbook needs thorough appraisal in terms of quality. Once a textbook is chosen, the teacher may use it as a guide. Within that framework, the teacher may choose a variety of learning opportunities for pupils to supplement content in the textbook. A multimedia approach should be used to provide for individual differences. A textbook should never be used with no other  instructional materials. Teachers should use textbooks in a flexible manner, and they should be discouraged from saying they teach well due to not using a textbook. Quality instruction rests upon the uses made of textbooks by creative teachers and pupils in teaching and learning situations. (RS)",

This paper first reviews what seem to be two opposed theories of teaching genre. After arguing that to differing extents both theories rely upon a transmission model of teaching, the paper then discusses attempts to teach genre as a tool for student-initiated research in a writing internship course. It states that the class sessions provided useful content and invention strategies for later reflection and critique because genre theory became a language tried on in class--in many ways like the discourse students were trying on at their internships. The paper suggests that in the future students might be asked if they feel any tension between the  abstract principles of rhetoric they learn in class and the situated, practical knowledge they learn on site.

        "description":"For both reading and writing, context and perspective are everything; Ann Berthoff suggests that students &quot;write continuously in a double-entry notebook.&quot; One instructor has utilized Berthoff's double-entry notebook in a technical writing class and finds that this classroom practice has also been informed by other theories inquiring into writing and composition: theory of meaning, theory of language, theory of learning, and theory of research. These theories manifest themselves in all the assignments and in classroom activities revolving around double-entry notebooks. For the class, six writing assignments which revolve around the final research project are based on the premise that in composition class, Isocrates' notion of Logos is taught--students learn how to combine words  and thought, apply what they write to everyday life and problems, and learn how to make meaning through critical reading/writing and collaborative activities. The assignments are: an employment packet; a memo requesting permission for the topic chosen for the research project; a summary packet summarizing pertinent articles; a research proposal of the major project that identifies a problem in their profession; a progress report; and a final formal report of the research project. For each assignment, students are given instructions and model writings to read and analyze by the use of two columns in their double-entry notebook. They are asked to compare notes, comments, and subjective reflections. (NKA)",

Results indicated that: (1) digital literacy and the English curriculum can coexist; (2) classroom dynamics were high; (3) logistic difficulties arose; (4) boys were involved most, but in some cases girls were involved equally; and (5) students improved their reading achievement.

        "description":"For an educator who teaches English in a multicultural setting, the best way to accommodate marked features of African-American vernacular English (AAVE) in black students' freshman essays is to preserve these features in teaching students narrative writings and guide African-American students to avoid these features in expository (academic) essays such as argumentative essays and research papers. This paper explores classroom research which focuses on how to guide black students in using their personal voices appropriately when writing narrative essays and avoid these features in their expository essays and research papers. Personal interviews were used and classroom activities were designed that engage black students in understanding that their personal voices are acceptable in  their discourse communities or in narrative essays but not in academic discourse. Some of the classroom activities involved sequenced writing assignments focusing on AAVE features for an English 1101 class with a majority of black students. The assignments consisted of: (1) a narrative essay; (2) a comparison and contrast essay; (3) an evaluation essay; (4) an argumentative essay; and (5) a research oriented solution essay. This sequenced assignment method has proved to be useful and effective with most of the ebonics-influenced writers in the class. Educators should explain to their students that everyone comes from a different discourse community, but that understanding people from different communities is easier when all can communicate in the communal discourse community: edited  American English.

        "description":"This paper reports on the myriad difficulties in getting rid of an unsatisfactory writing examination in place at Western Washington University. First, the paper provides background information on how and why the exam (the Junior Writing Exam) came to be adopted in the 1980s (as a diagnostic test only) and explains what the exam was meant to examine. Then, it recounts how the examination became a required pass in 1991, with a significant failure rate of 40% by 1992. The writing program directors tried to improve instructional support services and instructor training since the students who failed became demoralized and bitter. The drain on Writing Center resources became alarming, and the center's personnel were desperate for a solution. This &quot;rising junior&quot; test was finally  replaced with a different type of exam, one that was not decontextualized and lacking validity but, instead, an authentic writing task. It finds that, instead of concentrating on fixing or eliminating an exam, educators at Western Washington are now launched on establishing an interdisciplinary community of inquiry involving faculty, administrators, and students as part of the Carnegie Campus Conversations Program.

To see what this is like, the paper offers the stories those in the conference group (i.e., the authors) told each other as they explored their experiences as teachers and learners. Each case illustrates how teachers, students, or members of the community variously take the roles of apprentices or experts. Each one also describes activities which engage students and  teachers in passionate, personal, and critical ways of interacting with the world with and through language. The atelier/classroom is the site for the arts of discourse, that is the language arts. English curriculum should be a place for concentration on the language and discourse practices of contexts beyond the classroom. Contains 13 notes. (NKA)",

        "description":"Thirty-eight rural kindergarten students participated in this quasi-experimental study designed to assess the effect of employing daily, sequential phonemic awareness exercises on kindergartners' developmental spelling skills. In September all students were assessed for letter recognition, symbol-sound correspondence, phoneme segmentation and blending skills, and developmental spelling level. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (revised) for receptive language was administered to show equality between treatment and control groups. Both groups received the same instruction on alphabet recognition and sound-symbol correspondence. In late February, after 5 months of phonemic awareness training, the 20 students in the treatment group scored significantly higher on auditory  three-phoneme blending and segmentation measures than the 18 children who did not receive the training. On an assessment of graphemic representation of three-phoneme words, the 14 non-ESL (English as a second language) students in the treatment group scored significantly higher than the 13 non-ESL students in the control group. An analysis of spelling in the journal writings in March showed that five students in the treatment group compared to one student in the control group were writing at the phonetic developmental spelling level (Gentry, 1982). The majority of children in both classes were writing at the semi-phonetic level. Students in the treatment group demonstrated a more consistent skill at rereading their writings than their counterparts in the control group. The results of this  study suggest that phoneme segmentation skill increases student ability to represent more phonemes in words they attempt to write. Contains 23 references and 11 figures.

        "description":"A study investigated the working relationship between writing program directors and writing center directors nationally, to develop a picture of such a relationship and to compare the nature and status of the two positions and the backgrounds of the people who hold them. In all, about 650 surveys were distributed to members of professional associations, and useable responses were received from 176 people. Responses suggest that writing program directors regard writing center directors more as partners and less as helpmates than they did in a 1988 study (Olson and Ashton-Jones), and that the relation of the program director to the center director is much more collaborative than supervisory. Often, collaboration and communication can help overcome a lack of power or status in their  institutions or a lack of knowledge about composition research, management practices, or institutional politics. Still, survey data suggest that program directors enjoy a more privileged place in college/university structures and that the professionalization of center directors is lagging behind the professionalization of other writing program administrators. Respondents almost never described coming to an agreement about philosophies and goals as a result of collaboration. Many respondents mentioned how important it was for a director in either position to be a scholar in composition studies. (Contains 9 tables, 4 notes, and 27 references.

        "description":"This lesson offers students experience in making historical meaning from eyewitness accounts that present a range of different perspectives. Students begin with a case study in working with alternative reports of a single event: the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. First, they compare two newspaper reports on the fire, then two memoirs of the fire written many decades later. After noting how these accounts complement and compete with each another, students produce a research report explaining how they would use these primary source materials to write three kinds of history: a factual account of the fire, a description of the historical experience, and an interpretation of the fire's historical significance. Turning from this well-documented event, students next consider a unique  eyewitness account--the diary kept by a Confederate girl when her Tennessee town was occupied by Union troops during the Civil War. The lesson asks students to evaluate the reliability of this primary source and to draw up a list of questions they would want to ask and issues they would want to explore before making this eyewitness report part of the historical record. To conclude the lesson, students apply their research skills to present-day eyewitness accounts, gathering published examples or conducting interviews, and produce a report on their value and use as historical evidence. The lesson plan also contains the subject areas covered in the lesson, time required to complete the lesson, the skills used in the lesson, the grade level (6-12), and lists of the standards developed by  professional or government associations that are related to the lesson, as well as activities to extend the lesson.

In Part II, students examine how the region has been mapped at different stages in United States history and create informational brochures which reflect the changes the maps mark in the functional definitions of the Great Plains. In Part III, students compare descriptions of the region, from the time of the Spanish conquistadors to the early 20th century, and write their own descriptions based on these models in order to gauge how changing perceptual definitions of a region reshape its  identity and its relationship to human life. Finally, in Part IV, students compare images of two cultures that made their homes on the Great Plains, Native Americans and &quot;sodbusters,&quot; and summarize their distinct ways of life and the distinctive regional identity each brought to the Great Plains by writing imaginary letters from a Native American and a sodbuster homesick for the land they have left behind.

They then investigate Twain's use of dialect by continuing a story that Wheeler starts to tell, imitating his comic style. In Part II, students compare Twain's story with one of the Sut Lovingood stories by George Washington Harris, again examining the story's structure by performing it as a skit. After considering how this structure &quot;frames&quot; the trickster Sut Lovingood, as compared to the frame Twain  creates for his trickster, Jim Smiley, students produce a character sketch of Harris' comic protagonist and a sample of his humorous dialect. Finally, in Part III, students read a humorous story by Nathaniel Hawthorne in order to gain perspective on Twain's brand of humor and its significance within the context of American literary tradition. After debating the merits of &quot;moral&quot; humor like Hawthorne's as compared with the &quot;folk&quot; humor of Harris and Twain, students test the possibilities of blending these traditions by recasting a paragraph of Hawthorne's story in dialect style.

        "description":"This lesson plan introduces students to one of the most widely-read genres of 19th-century American literature and an important influence within the African American literary tradition today. The lesson focuses on the &quot;Narrative of William W. Brown, An American Slave&quot; (1847), which, along with the &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; (1845), set the pattern for this genre and its combination of varied literary traditions and devices. To help students recognize the complex nature of the slave narrative, the lesson explores Brown's work from a variety of perspectives. Students first consider the narrative as a historical record, examining episodes that describe the conditions Brown lived through as a slave. Next, they examine it as a work of literature, investigating the  rhetorical techniques Brown uses to shape his experiences into a story. Third, students consider the work's political dimension, weighing the arguments that Brown presents as an abolitionist spokesman and the degree to which his narrative should be treated as political rhetoric. Finally, students approach the narrative as an autobiography, a work of self-actualization in which Brown charts a spiritual as well as a literal journey to freedom. To conclude the lesson, students produce an essay explaining how Brown's narrative challenged the prejudices of white readers in his own time and how it challenges prejudices today.

After a brief introduction to the opening of the &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; which portrays Dante as a pilgrim guided by the poet Virgil on a journey through the Christian afterlife toward God, students read Canto 5 of the &quot;Inferno,&quot; which comes near the beginning of Dante's descent into Hell. Students refer to a diagram of Dante's underworld to understand the role of Minos at the start of this canto, then analyze Dante's description of the storm-tossed souls he encounters in order to gain further insight into his allegorical method. Next, students identify the famous lovers who set the stage for Paolo and Francesca and consider how they lend a literary dimension to  readers' perception of this pair. Finally, students examine Francesca's &quot;confession,&quot; comparing the philosophical style in which she first describes her love affair with the story-telling style she uses to describe what actually occurred. At the center of her story is the already-famous love story of Lancelot and Guinevere, and students consider how this story-within-a-story structure reflects on Francesca's own efforts to portray herself as a victim of courtly love. To conclude the lesson, students compare the effect that Lancelot's story had on Paolo and Francesca with the effect their story has on Dante in the poem, and the effect this layered episode has on Dante's readers today.

Students first examine a selection of traditional African artworks that portray women within precolonial family and community life.

Students look first at the sonnet in which Romeo and Juliet meet, analyzing the imagery to gain insight into the way Shakespeare's use of love sonnet conventions characterizes the moment and the relationship between the lovers. Then students act the passage to notice how Shakespeare stage manages this moment and consider what perspective his making the lovers almost literally &quot;kiss by the book&quot; lends to readers' perception of their characters. Finally, students enact the scene in which this moment occurs in order to notice how Shakespeare  combines poetic forms, ranging from the almost-prose of Capulet and the Nurse to the melodramatic style of Tybalt, to achieve something akin to the cuts and framing that are possible in film. To conclude, students work in groups to find similar moments in the play (e.g., the balcony scene, the tomb scene, etc.) where Shakespeare spotlights the action through lyric form and at the same time invites the audience to see through the idealization of lyric conventions by having the characters act out these conceits on stage.

The paper concludes that at this educational juncture, the United States can learn from European and Asian countries by observing how former &quot;minority&quot; cultures are incorporated, by observing how sensitivity is needed for the expectations of those  entering a new culture, and by asking what priority should be put on multiple language learning.

        "description":"In the early years of the Internet, there was an expectation that the availability and easy access to online resources of unparalleled abundance would increase educational equity throughout the socio-economic spectrum. In fact, research suggests that patterns of technology access often mirror existing inequalities rather than mitigate them, and if corrective steps are not taken, technology may worsen rather than solve equity disparities. Major obstacles to using the Internet are cost and knowledge of how to use the Internet. Among the educational benefits language arts teachers describe are those involving the development of research skills, integrated learning, interactivity, writing for real purposes and authentic audiences, handling difficult topics in new ways, multicultural  learning, and collaborative problem solving. Despite the rapid growth of wired schools, surveys suggest that use of technology to affect classroom practice tends to be limited to small groups of teachers who are excited by the potential they believe technology has to motivate their students or to access new sources.

        "description":"This report describes a program for improving student organizational skills. The targeted population consisted of a fourth-grade self contained class, a sixth-grade science class, and a high school nine through twelve learning disability class in an elementary, middle, and high school setting. The schools were located in middle to upper class suburban communities in the Midwest. The deficiencies in organizational skills were documented with student, parent, and teacher surveys, and an organizational checklist. Analysis of probable causes indicated that many students of all ages lack organizational skills due to developmental factors, school structure, and parent involvement. The deficiencies of organizational skills adversely affected various situations, including student  success. A review of the solution strategies suggested by other researchers, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in teaching students: time management skills, prioritizing, homework, study skills, organizing student materials in a desk, locker, backpack or trapper, and keeping an assignment notebook. The program included lessons in role playing, cooperative group activities, teacher modeling, problem solving activities, worksheets, self evaluation, checklists, and goal setting which were all incorporated into the curriculum. Post intervention information collected indicated an increase in student organizational skills such as keeping an organized desk, locker, backpack and assignment notebook. Students showed improvement in homework completion and class preparation.  (Contains 26 references and 11 tables of data. Appendixes contain 3 survey instruments and a semantic web.) (Author/RS)",

        "description":"This report describes an early intervention program to elicit emergent literacy skills in Potentially English Proficient kindergarten students. The school is located in a suburb of a large city near a naval base. The problem, lack of literacy readiness skills, was documented with a battery of tests given prior to entrance in kindergarten and the results of teacher and parent surveys. Analysis of probable cause indicated that there was a lack of literacy readiness skills in the Limited English Proficient population needed in order to start the formal academic kindergarten instruction. This was due to developmental factors, dysfunctional families, frequent exposure to fast paced stimuli (television), and limited exposure to pre-educational opportunities. Another factor is due to  some parents not aware that literacy was a form of discourse that is developed from birth and is translated into the academic environment when the child starts school. A review of the solution of strategies suggested by other researchers, combined with an analysis of the test results, resulted in the development of age appropriate activities to foster an environment conducive to the development of literacy skills. The program included lessons involving emergent literacy activities and the use of the multiple intelligences. Post intervention data revealed an increase in emergent literacy behaviors due to a literacy environment that was conducive to the students' needs. This included mnemonics, field trips, exposure to many forms of printed materials, developmental play, and centers related  to pre-literacy and literacy skills.

        "description":"This report describes a program to increase sight/functional vocabulary to improve reading comprehension. The targeted population consisted of one 2nd-3rd grade and one 6th-8th grade cross-categorical self-contained class, located in an elementary school and a middle school. The schools were located in a northeast suburb of a major city in the Midwest. The problem of inadequate recognition of sight/functional vocabulary and its impact on comprehension was documented with parent, teacher, and student surveys, daily assignments, tests, and checklists. Analysis of probable cause data indicated that school environment played a role in the inability of students to acquire this vocabulary. Inadequate time spent on meaningful learning experiences hindered the comprehension required for  long-term recall. Parental support was often lacking, which contributed to the children's deficits. A review of the solution strategies suggested by other researchers, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the implementation of the following intervention strategies: thematic/functional word walls, the Edmark Reading Program, Home Reading Logs, Dolch Sight Word Wall, a Survival Signs Program, calendar activities, vocabulary games, and community-based field trips. More intervention techniques were needed to improve basic reading sight vocabulary. However, post intervention data indicated that the students improved their knowledge and recognition of functional environmental signs. (Contains 53 references, and 13 tables and 3 figures of data.

        "author":["Henry, Mallika"],
        "description":"Using qualitative and interpretive methodologies, this dissertation analyzed Richard Courtney's writings to interpret his basic ideas on learning through drama. It focused on later writings (1989, 1990, 1995, 1997) in which Courtney distilled ideas he had been working on for as many as 30 years. It approached Courtney's texts using dramatistic metaphors which concretized his predominantly abstract writings. These metaphors focused on finding the basic elements of a drama: the setting, the act, the actor, and the Other. Through the lenses afforded by these metaphors, the thesis examined Courtney's wide-ranging, eclectic and often imprecise ideas to distill major themes. Courtney used notions like metaphor, symbol, ritual, Being, mind, perspective, oscillation and quaternity with  apparently shifting definitions and loosely circumscribed meanings. It collected and analyzed Courtney's meanings recursively, both distilling Courtney's meanings and expanding them through concrete hypothetical examples. Courtney wrote about drama in abstract terms, using notions he had garnered from other disciplines to describe the process of learning through drama. The final construction that emerged in this dissertation represents the experience of the actor/learner: it is concentric, radiating from a nub which represents the feelings and imagination of the actor. Radiating circles represent the actor's metaphoric thinking, taken here as a cognitive approach to perspectival understandings of self and others, in an existential form of learning. This construction has implications for  research and education. It refers to the many dramas that take place in living interactions. It is a construction for understanding and facilitating the learning processes which take place in the dynamic interactions between people, and which inform personal awareness and understanding. Contains approximately 675 references and 24 figures. Appendixes contain sample pages from Courtney's bibliography, sample letters from him, and a photograph of Courtney. (Author/RS)",

The credo will be established using the intellectual capital of communications educators and researchers, as well as the heritage of rhetorical thought and the growing consciousness of the breadth and depth of the communication enterprise and its dominant role in our world. Several guidelines are suggested for the formation of the credo: (1) it must be grounded in respect for the moral worth of each human being and in democracy and democratic values; (2) it must account for the ethical dimension of all communication, for  various communication roles and responsibilities, and for the increased power of communication and its consequent uncontrollable nature; (3) it must be offered as suggestion rather than commandment; and (4) it must be broadly applicable.

The targeted population consisted of third and fourth grade students in three different elementary schools. Two schools are located in far northern suburbs outside a large midwestern city. The other school is a southern suburb of a smaller midwestern city. The problem of poor listening skills was documented with teacher, parent, and student surveys, standardized testing scores, and teacher checklists. Analysis of probable cause indicated that lack of instruction, environmental issues, physical conditions of students, and psychological factors may affect the students' listening. Review of the research also indicated that students were not introduced to listening skills  in the school setting. A review of the solution strategies suggested by other researchers, combined with an analysis of the problem setting, resulted in the development of listening skill instruction and the reduction of noise levels in the environment. The program included cooperative learning activities, direct instruction of active listening, and various listening activities.

        "description":"This guide answers three basic questions on how to develop a professional community of learners: (1) What type of polices, structures, and procedures will help staff to connect with and learn from one another? (2) What incentives help schools to undertake community-wide learning? and (3) How can schools transform themselves into professional learning communities? The guide outlines the characteristics of professional learning communities, suggests some clear targets for teachers who participate in these communities, outlines the underlying principles for achieving this type of teacher learning, and discusses the work of school leaders who are creating such learning communities. The text explores how learning communities are fostered when groups of educators within a building  share a common purpose for learning. This shared purpose can then lead to a type of learning that builds upon common experiences and is committed to an ongoing analysis of the actions and underlying causes behind those outcomes. The paper focuses on teacher learning in school settings, ways to clarify goals when developing a professional community, building incentives for teacher learning/skill development, principles that promote learning, factors affecting learning-to-learn skills, and advice for administrators on how to reengineer incentives. Four appendices offer further suggestions for encouraging professional development. (RJM)",

This report outlines reasons why schools, businesses, industry, and other agencies should actively pursue educational partnerships, shares examples of successful and valuable educational partnerships, and concludes with an examination of some issues and concerns. The educational partnerships that have contributed to the success of the Galileo Center at banded Peak School in Bragg Creek, Alberta, are also examined. Educators and business representatives should discuss the variety of  activities in which they will participate, as well as the mutual benefits of their collaboration. Some examples of partnership activities and school-to-work transition programs that potential partners may be interested in pursuing for mutual benefit include the following: (1) shared computer-based projects; (2) reading and math programs; (3) technical training; (4) guest speakers; (5) displaying and publishing student work; (6) extracurricular connections, and (7) educator and employee workshops.

        "description":"This paper reviews postapartheid educational policy between the 1994 and 1999 elections. Its objective is to interrogate the different concerns, approaches, and implications of the various policies that have been formulated to fundamentally transform the legacy of the apartheid system. Five principal concerns are discussed: (1) the historical legacy of apartheid education; (2) equity and justice; (3) democracy and participation; (4) economy and globalization; and (5) efficiency, quality, and effectiveness. The paper examines existing critical analyses of educational policy development and highlights what critics point out as the process of educational compromise and the narrowing of the policy agenda. Researchers have reported a growing skepticism regarding educational policy  development in South Africa. While some hail the new policies, others worry about deep conceptual flaws, implied political betrayals, and empty principles. However, all of these accounts only provide partial explanatory frameworks for understanding educational change. By adopting a metapolicy approach to educational policy development, the paper considers the various influences that have shaped, and continue to shape, educational policy discourses.

The instructor taught group dynamics and modeled the process of facilitating and developing collaboration in teams. Classes were offered in 3-1/2 hour sessions for 5 weeks. Various team-building materials were conducted throughout the course of the class, and simulations and field studies were used to encourage insight into group process and problems of communication. This paper discusses the effectiveness of: (1) course content and materials; (2) learning activities and skill practice; and (3) working in teams to accomplish class and team objectives. The purpose of the study was to collect data for class improvement but also to model  the need to effectively assess work-team progress in the workplace. When what they liked best about the class, students commented positively about experiencing a mixture of lecture and group activity, learning about themselves while being in a team, and being treated as professionals who could work effectively in teams. Suggestions were mixed about the content-laden midterm but positive about being graded on both their individual and group test scores. An appendix contains a copy of the questionnaire.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the collegial relationship between school leaders and teachers, and describes the very specific policies behind the school leader's influence on teachers' professional development. In the first phase, 39 teachers from 11 schools were interviewed regarding the teachers' perceptions of their personal professional development and professional relationships with other team members. In the second phase, a case study was made of two Flemish schools to analyze the relationships between the concepts explored in the first phase and the patterns that could be discerned in these relationships. The hypothesis that teachers' professional development depends not only on the individual teacher's commitment but also on several workplace conditions was confirmed. The  teachers' perceptions of the way school leaders function appears to be an important parameter for the appreciation of the contribution of the school to the process of professional development. The paper recommends that one should get closer to the participants in the leadership relationship and argues for a symbolic &quot;interactionist&quot; approach paying full attention to the meanings, perspectives, and purposes underlining the social relations between school leaders and teachers.

A community school in Ohio is a new kind of public school-an independent public school that is nonsectarian and nondiscriminatory. The report presents three contexts for the study--historical, local and methodological--and highlights some of the lessons being learned as a group of public, urban educators reinvent their work and themselves. Finally, it discusses the educational importance of this work and suggests implications for professional development trainers and school personnel involved in continuous school improvement, with special attention to those in the Accelerated Schools Project. Goals for WOW are similar to training goals for other schools. Participants are  expected to become familiar with the Accelerated School philosophy and process and have a greater understanding of the personal, social and cultural issues surrounding school improvement. The goal is that participants gain a better understanding of the dynamic of both personal and school change and become leaders in moving their school through the Accelerated School process. (DFR)",

It offers lessons learned from a decade of states' efforts to improve student achievement and answers three questions: (1) Where do students in the SREB states stand relative to national averages? (2) Is student achievement in SREB states improving? and (3) What challenges remain for SREB states? Several SREB states have reached or exceeded the national average for some measures of student achievement, but none has reached  that goal for most measures of student achievement. All SREB states have improved on at least 1 measure of student achievement over the last 10 years. Although the last decade has seen improvements in the amount and quality of information about ways to raise student performance, there continues to be unacceptably large gaps among the achievement levels of students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds and from different income levels.

Current programs, procedures, and policies need to confront these challenges with smarter strategies for planning and implementation, such as schools that serve as centers of their communities; gymnasiums and play fields that double as community parks and recreation centers; auditoriums that serve as community theaters; and incorporation of centralized libraries, health clinics, and other community services into schools for greater community access and  engagement. Smarter schools can also use a wide range of community resources--like museums, zoos, and other existing facilities--to create integrated learning centers. Smarter schools is a concept that also has implications for the so-called &quot;smart growth&quot; strategies for urban and regional planning. An overview of seven case studies that embody some of these smarter planning principles are included. (DFR)",

        "description":"The ability to understand and frame problems encountered in practice is a critical skill for school leaders. This paper reports on a study that inquired about the teaching and learning of problem-framing skills in the Prospective Principals Program at Stanford University, a preparation program for school administrators that relies on problem-based learning (PBL) strategies for 40 percent of the curriculum. A literature-based definition of problem-framing ability is developed, and a theoretical rationale for the study is introduced. Incorporating the use of a quasi-experimental study design, the program-framing skills in three successive student cohorts, with graduated levels of exposure to the PBL, are assessed. Analysis reveals that all three cohorts differ significantly in  problem-framing ability, associated with their level of exposure to PBL. Qualitative data, collected through a series of student interviews, support the quantitative findings. Problem-based learning experiences are instrumental for developing prospective principals' ability to frame problems in practice. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the findings for instructional practice and explores ideas for possible future research on the use of problem-based learning in administrator preparation.

This Legislative Office of Education Oversight (LOEO) report examines Ohio's first 15 community schools that began during the 1998-99 school year. All 15 schools were successful about opening, completing a full school year, and continuing into a second year; however, many had delays in their funding. LOEO anticipates that community schools will require substantial and continuing technical assistance, and the Ohio Department of Education will need to meet the unique needs of community schools as it provides technical assistance. Community schools are contractually held accountable for the academic performance of their  students with their sponsors; however, information regarding accountability in their annual reports was lacking. LOEO recommends that community schools become familiar with and adhere to the community school law and contractual agreements regarding accountability. It also recommends that community-school sponsors become familiar with community-school law and hold community schools responsible for accountability measures.

It first outlines major concepts of postmodern feminism, after which it begins to focus specifically on postmodern feminism and education. The paper contends that a goal of all educators should be to provide an educational environment where gender inequity is not tolerated. All provinces and states should require their educational institutions to develop policies that will help to create an environment free from all forms of discrimination. Educators have a legal and ethical responsibility to prevent gender inequity in the educational environment. Ultimately, the paper details educational policy development utilizing work on the role of epistemology and expertise  in policymaking. The first appendix outlines potential policy initiatives that would promote more gender equitable practices within schools, including maternity and family leave, recruitment and hiring, part-time teachers, and affirmative action programs.

In selecting the sample, the practical population was defined as all of the American K-12 schools and colleges whose Web sites were linked to one of two comprehensive sites (one for K-12 schools, one for colleges). Ten major themes emerged from the data. The relative frequencies of each major theme were computed across the sample. The results of the study indicate that the purpose of school shifts from emotional development in the early levels of schooling to cognitive development at the college level. In addition, mission statements vary greatly both within and between school levels with most schools emphasizing four  different themes in their mission statement. Relevant policy implications and suggestions for further research are discussed. (Contains 15 references.) (Author/MLF)",

Various authors contend that competency management has the potential of integrating organizational strategy, human-resource instruments, and human-resource development; that competency development can lead to performance improvement; and that it can help Human Resource Development (HRD) professionals in aligning their practices to the needs of the changing organization. A study was designed with four objectives. The first objective was to analyze the concept of competence, seeing what definitions are brought forward and how the concept is perceived in practice. The second objective was to evaluate the dissemination of the concept. The third objective was to evaluate the potential of competency development for vertical  integration, and for HRD programs and practices. The fourth objective was to analyze the contribution of the concept of competency development for the HRD profession. Data collection for the study involved telephone interviews with 80 for-profit and nonprofit organizations, 35 telephone interviews with directors of Human Resource Management (HRM) in large organizations, and questionnaire responses from 130 HRD managers. Finally, an analysis was undertaken of the critical views of organizations that have introduced competency development systems. Based on the findings, recommendations are given for other organizations that want to introduce competency development systems. (Contains 38 references.) (MLF)",

        "description":"Based on a national data set, a study investigated the factors that influence parents' decision to choose schools for their children. The data for the study were extracted from the public-release data file from the School Safety and Discipline (SS&D) component of the 1993 National Household Education Survey. Parents with children in 3rd through 12th grades from the 50 States and the District of Columbia were interviewed. The total number of completed SS&D interviews was 12,680. From this data, parents' choices were grouped into the following categories: (1) assigned school (public school district assigns the neighborhood school to the residents); (2) chosen school (there are two situations in chosen school: first, parents choose the public school that is not located in their  neighborhood; second, parents like the specific public school district so they live in this area in order for their children to attend this neighborhood school); (3) private school (parents choose to send their children to a private school where the parents have to pay tuition for their children.) Among 12,680 parents, 10,017 chose assigned school, 1,382 parents chose chosen school, and 1,281 parents chose private school. Parents' education level and family income do affect parents' position on school choice. White parents with higher education and income levels are more likely to choose private school, while black parents with higher education level and lower family income are more likely to exercise their choice within the public school system. Parents who look for quality indicators  such as small school size, homogeneous ethnicity, and safer schools have the propensity to choose private schools. Parents who look for quality factors such as proximity, median school size, and safe schools have the tendency to choose assigned schools. (Contains 19 references.) (MLF)",

A study was undertaken to report what the respondents identified as the essential performance-based skills and knowledge needed for middle-level leadership, and to assess and project the impact of these knowledge and skill areas on administrator preparation programs. These issues were examined by surveying and interviewing middle-level principals about personal characteristics, job roles and tasks, and professional beliefs related to middle schools and the middle-school philosophy. Data were collected using surveys and semistructured interviews. Initially, surveys were sent to 125 middle-level principals in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Of these, 72 surveys were returned for data analysis. From the pool of  survey respondents, 17 principals indicated that they were willing to be interviewed. An analysis of the qualitative data revealed that effective middle-level principals: (1) have a very positive outlook about their work, experience a high degree of job satisfaction, and view school problems as surmountable; (2) are more teacher-oriented; (3) are supportive of parent/community involvement in their schools; (4) have a high tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty; and (5) are intentional in their efforts to assemble, develop, and maintain a staff of dedicated educators who want to be in a middle school. Additionally, the analysis revealed that formal education in educational administration appeared to have no bearing on middle-level principals' effectiveness, and that levels of  participation in professional associations appeared to be unrelated to principal effectiveness.

        "description":"This paper addresses the special problems in assessment of pupils who are congenitally or prelingually deafblind and who may have other disabilities, and argues that nonintrusive instruments and procedures are the assessment tools of choice. It contends that not enough attention has been given to developing, validating, and applying assessment procedures that meet the specialized needs of individuals whose major problem is not lack of inherent ability but a lack of opportunity to experience the world through the distance receptors of sound and/or sight, and that the use of inappropriate tests has led to placing children with deaf-blindness in unsuitable settings and cutting them off from learning what they must know for successful adaptation. The paper presents a fictitious case  study to introduce nonintrusive assessment and BASIC (Behavioral Assessment Schedules for Individual Children), a nonintrusive assessment instrument. BASIC does not directly involve the pupil in a specific, structured task presented in a formal manner, but rather uses behavior observations. Ways in which nonintrusive assessments differ from currently applied standardized assessment tools are discussed, and nonintrusive measures that successfully assess persons who are deaf-blind are described.

A study was conducted that asked 60 British teachers, all of whom had some designated responsibilities for students with behavior problems, to identify a set of personal and professional characteristics which were most likely to equip teachers to work successfully with students with emotional and behavior disorders. In addition, the teachers were asked to rank their selection according to importance or significance. Findings indicate teachers found it very difficult to separate the professional characteristics of doing their job from those of a more personal nature. Communication skills, besides being the most frequently mentioned professional  characteristic, were also prioritized as the most important. Skills with individual students were prioritized first by 14 percent of the teachers, while classroom management was identified by 11 percent. The use of humor was identified as the most important personal attribute, both in terms of frequency and its position as the top-priority characteristic. Patience also out-scored the most frequently mentioned professional characteristics and was ranked top by 24 percent of the teachers, while calmness and empathy also scored highly.

The second part of the study examined whether the scores arising from the two timing conditions measured the same construct (i.e., reading comprehension) for both groups of students. Results indicate that students with learning disabilities made significantly larger gains on the ITBS Reading Comprehension Test under extended-time conditions than students  without learning disabilities who received appropriate timing instructions. Results also found testing directions had an effect on student performance. Non learning disabled students given instructions to take their time did not perform any differently than students with learning disabilities under extended-time conditions. When students without disabilities were told to work at a slow and careful pace, where time was not a factor, they made significant gains under extended-time conditions; however, when they were told to work at a normal rate, they did not make significant gains.

The other child was found to be over included. She was one of the most popular students in the class, was never alone on the playground, and could always be found standing or walking about, surrounded by a loosely  defined circle of girls.

Specifically, the study addressed whether teachers of gifted students utilized task-focused instructional practices more often than performance-focused instructional practices, whether teachers of gifted students perceived differential achievement goal pursuit between high achieving and low achieving gifted students, and whether teachers of gifted students perceived within-group differences in goal pursuit for both high achieving and low achieving gifted students. Forty-nine teachers of gifted elementary students completed the \"Approaches to Teaching and Learning\" scale from the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey and a modified  version of the \"Personal Goals Orientation\" student scale. Results indicated that teachers of gifted students reported significantly more use of task-focused instruction compared to performance-focused instruction. Teachers perceived high achieving gifted students to pursue task and performance-approach goals significantly more often than low achieving gifted students. High achieving gifted students were also perceived to pursue task and performance-approach achievement goals significantly more often compared to their pursuit of performance-avoidance goals. No relative difference in achievement goal pursuit was perceived for low achieving gifted students. (Contains 41 references.) (Author/CR)",

Areas of concern identified through state monitoring are discussed, and Colorado's credentialing system for support personnel is described. Accomplishments and challenges of the Colorado early childhood program are also addressed. (CR)",

Overall results indicated that the intervention with kindergarten students resulted in demonstrated increases in social behavior directed toward peers with disabilities and more acceptance at posttest of children with disabilities on sociometric measures. Change across time was reflected on the Acceptance Scale for Kindergartners. Analysis of qualitative data found benefits in the following areas: greater  understanding of individuals with disabilities; greater acceptance of individuals with disabilities and/or individuals who are different; support of reading at home; and improved development of social, language, and play skills. Year-by-year project achievements are reported for procedural objectives, expected outcomes, evaluation results, supplemental information/changes, and budget information.

        "author":["Dorn, Sherman"],
        "description":"This review of the history of special education in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1940 to 1990 focuses on two issues: first, how advocacy for children with disabilities and research changed the practice of special education after World War II in Nashville; and second, how the internal dynamics of the schools in Nashville shaped special education during this period. The review involved more than two dozen oral history interviews and examination of archival material such as hundreds of newspaper articles. The review concludes that both research and advocacy have been particularly important in program development within the Nashville public school systems, especially when pilot programs could be established with minimal disruption to organizational routines. The influence of research  and advocacy on specific pedagogy, both teaching methods and quality of teachers, was more difficult to ascertain since experimental programs were often dependent on existing teachers who lacked necessary training. Individual sections address: successful long-term influences, influences without clear success, and the greater success of pilot programs outside existing public schools. A concluding section addresses the importance of developing the teaching skills of general education teachers if special education is to be effective. A list of papers and presentations by the author is appended. (DB)",

Parent training sessions were in the parents' homes and included videotaping the parent reading/signing to their child and provision of feedback to parents based on a checklist of desirable literacy strategies. Among results of the intervention were the  following: parents learned to modify reading strategies to fit the specific literacy needs of their deaf/hh child; parents began utilizing sign language more for daily communication; parents were exposed to African-American deaf culture and deaf culture in general; and the children were provided with a strong literacy model (their parent).

In the first study, an experimental section of an introductory course in teaching utilized a literary text-based course module, whereas the control group section read chapters from standard texts. In the second study, special education majors who were enrolled in an introductory course in the education of children with emotional and behavioral disorders read either literary trade books or chapters from standard texts. In both studies, reading literary texts was more effective than reading professional texts in  promoting positive attitude change. The paper discusses change mechanisms existing within literature and the therapeutic components created through the use of literature, drawing implications for the use of literature in teacher education.

        "description":"This study explored how and why special education policy issues were treated as they were in the formulation of Pennsylvania's charter school law, Act 22 of 1997. The qualitative study utilized formal and informal interviews of state policymakers, review of documents, review of archival records, and participant observation. Findings indicated a philosophical mismatch between two educational concepts: charter schools (a deregulated movement) and special education (seen as an over-regulated area). Among 15 specific findings were the following: (1) policymakers failed to anticipate the paradoxical outcome of making charter schools autonomous; (2) special education issues were neglected because special education experts were not called upon to contribute to the design of Act 22 of  1997; (3) policymakers feared that the charter school bill might be derailed if much time or exposure were given in the debate to the controversial matter of special education; and (4) the shift in competing values away from an emphasis on equity to a focus on liberty (choice) and efficiency contributed to the neglect of special education issues. The paper urges Pennsylvania policymakers to review and clarify issues concerning the Act's special education funding formula, admission of children with disabilities, transportation, and teacher certification.

The project has involved training of four project teams, each composed of a person with a developmental disability, a family member, and a person experienced in providing services. The responses of the 60 focus group participants are summarized in a model of self-determination involving different aspects of the individual, sources of support, and life processes and a selection of their comments concerning their understanding of self-determination, what support includes, and examples of self-determination. Also reported are system challenges identified by the group such as  accounting for the system's money in a way that is clear to people and their families and potential pitfalls such as exclusion of people based on unwarranted assumptions. Finally, the most important contributions of the self-determination project are identified including strengthening of self-advocacy organizations, realization by agency managers of new ways to foster self-determination, and a reconsideration of many aspects of case management.

Support strategies and three member  profiles are discussed. Experiences with cooperative entrepreneurship, the importance of a well-developed mission statement, advantages of entrepreneurship for people with severe disabilities, ways to by-pass traditional funding and regulatory mechanisms, and the benefits of mutual support are also addressed. The report closes with a discussion on the challenges that Working Order is facing, including enticing competitive entrepreneurs. (CR)",

        "description":"The Parent Leadership Program team that created and facilitated a Local Liaison Learning Group between September 1998 and November 1999 gathered in mid-January 2000 to discuss what they had learned. The Learning Group was thought of by the Parent Leadership Program team as an applied research setting for investigating the conditions that support or undermine change in families of children with disabilities and their communities. The compilation of a learning history, designed to capture Learning Group participants' views of their local projects at four points in the project years, describes a process intended to support change and intervention which mostly did not occur, because of the inability of project teams to overcome the barriers to taking any sustained and broad-based  action to influence their communities. The learning process did, however, contain important lessons for people concerned about improving family support and creating effective parent-professional partnerships. Lessons were learned also about the difficulty of acting creatively outside the boundaries of established roles and practices. (CR)",

(KFI) in March 1998. Since the mid-1980s, KFI, located in Millinocket, Maine, has transformed its supports for people with developmental disabilities from those that promote segregation to those that promote community inclusion and membership. KFI has transformed their preschool into an integrated preschool and closed the special purpose school, transferring children into regular public schools. In addition, they closed both the workshop and the day program, opting instead to support people in community jobs and other meaningful, integrated daytime activities. At the time of the site visit, the agency provided  supported living services to 22 people and day services to 14 individuals. The first section of the report describes some of the key factors that facilitated conversion. The next section presents examples of community supports provided by the agency. A concluding section discusses key components to the conversion process, including a value base that plays a strong role in guiding decisions and actions, persistence, creativity, a focus on relationships, and collaboration.

Progress is evaluated in the following areas: (1) disability research; (2) civil rights; (3) education; (4) health care; (5) long-term services and supports; (6) youth; (7) immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities with disabilities; (8) social security work incentives and programs; (9) employment; (10)  welfare-to-work; (11) housing; (12) transportation; (13) technology and telecommunications; and (14) international issues. The report concludes that current public policy results in an unemployment rate for people with disabilities exceeding 70 percent; that current policy favors institutional placements and segregated housing over independent living with appropriate support services; and that students with disabilities are not receiving special education in regular education environments. It urges solid leadership and commitment by enforcement agencies, as well as adequate investment to enforce civil rights laws, and the enactment of a strong Patient's Bill of Rights. (CR)",

The role of the Individualized Education Program as the main vehicle for expressing the need for test accommodations is emphasized. The paper then summarizes the research on test changes using a taxonomy from the National Center on Educational Outcomes. Testing accommodations are reviewed relating to timing and scheduling of testing, test settings, computer  presentation of tests, examiner familiarity, multiple changes in presentation, dictation to a proctor or scribe, using an alternative response, marking responses in test booklets, working collaboratively with other students, using word processors, using calculators, reinforcement, and instruction on test-taking strategies.

Innovative or alternative routes to certification in six states (Texas, Hawaii, Iowa, North Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia) are profiled to give specific examples of state approaches to personnel preparation and certification in this area. Telephone interviews were conducted with state directors of special education, other state education agency staff, educational service center staff, superintendents and administrators from schools for students with blindness, and administrators and faculty from institutions of higher education (IHEs). The interviews took place in August and September 1999 and lasted between 30 to 90 minutes each. A total of 13  people were interviewed. For each state, the origin, components, recruitment efforts, funding, and outcomes of the alternative certification program are described. Results of the survey indicate that all the states profiled use some sort of collaboration, including partnerships with IHEs, educational service centers, schools for the blind, and other state and local agencies. While some states rely on informal promotions of their certification programs, others target specific individuals or locations within the state in order to recruit students of a particular cultural or ethnic background.

It begins by explaining the four basic principles of self-determination: freedom, authority, support, and responsibility. The growing self-advocacy and parent advocacy movements within Idaho are described, along with the movements towards supported employment, deinstitutionalization, supported living, early intervention, and greater family support. Barriers to people achieving  self-determination are identified, and recommendations are made to improve the lives of people with developmental disabilities. Recommendations include: (1) look at ways to strengthen the collaboration among people who care about individuals with developmental disabilities; (2) take what has been learned about how people with developmental disabilities can create the lives they want within their communities and find ways to pilot additional opportunities for learning; (3) make individuals with developmental disabilities and their families partners in creating the policies which guide the system of support they rely on; and (4) revise Medicaid-funded developmental disabilities services.

Skilled thinkers use their knowledge and skills to make plans, to solve problems, and to communicate with others. They are able to make recommendations to others and provide reasons for them. The second part of the taxonomy, reasoning strategies, is then described. Reasoning strategies of gifted thinkers include the analysis and evaluation of ideas and arguments, the categorization and relating of items of knowledge, the movement from  issue to questions to proposition, the consideration of evidence, and the employment of moral reasoning. The final section of the taxonomy, reasoning dispositions, posits that good reasoners value open-mindedness, objectivity, intellectual integrity, and impartiality and habitually practice metacognition.

The objective of the project was to enable undergraduate teacher education students planning to teach students with learning disabilities to share online questions and comments with practicing teachers experienced in working with these students. The project was successful in creating an online community in which students gather firsthand knowledge from teacher mentors, and the teachers contribute to the training of their student partners. Both students and teachers responded enthusiastically to the project on follow-up surveys and student reports. Qualitative  analysis of conversation printouts and case study reports indicated that valuable learning occurs at both ends of the conversations. Most conversations took on a very personal flavor, and topics discussed included both the \"assigned\" topic and others of personal interest to the students. Students received a wealth of information on learning disabilities from their teacher partners, including both conceptual information about LD and information related to teaching strategies appropriate for students with LD. Extensions of the project are discussed. (Contains 20 references.) (Author/CR)",

The study was conducted in six elementary and two middle schools serving relatively large numbers of students who exhibited disruptive classroom behaviors. Two groups of students (grades 1-8) served as participants in the present study: target and criterion students. The 99 target students exhibited high rates of disruptive behaviors and/or severe forms of such behaviors whereas the 278 criterion students did not exhibit externalizing behaviors. The study was primarily descriptive in nature and focused on naturally occurring events in general  education classrooms. Results of the study indicate that the probability of target students complying with teachers' attempts to correct their disruptive behavior was relatively low; teachers were more likely to respond to the disruptive behaviors of target students with a reprimand than in the case of criterion students; target students primarily responded negatively to teachers' attempts to correct their behaviors; and students were more likely to exhibit lower rates of disruptive behaviors when teachers were using direct instruction or effective instruction methods.

        "description":"This thesis examines the cost and benefits of communication networks in K-12 schools using cost analysis of five technology models with increasing levels of connectivity. Data indicate that the cost of the network hardware is only a small fraction of the overall networking costs. PC purchases, initial training, and retrofitting are the largest one-time costs for starting the network, and network support is the largest ongoing annual cost that schools must face. Over the first 5 years, support and training together comprise 46 percent of the total costs of networking schools. Costs are significantly reduced when aggregated at the district and state levels due to increased purchasing power. Using the Internet's CNN Newsroom to evaluate the benefits of K-12 networking reveals that  students using CNN Newsroom placed more emphasis on the use of computers for school projects than did other students with similarly high access to technology. Lack of training and support was the biggest barrier for teachers and students, highlighting the need for school funding of the human infrastructure in addition to the network infrastructure.

Analysis indicate that the baseline service required for connecting to the NII will cost $9.4 to $22.0 billion in one-time costs with annual maintenance costs of $1.8 billion to $4.6 billion or $212 to $501 in one-time installation costs and an ongoing annual cost of $40 to $105 per pupil respectively. Hardware is the most significant cost item for schools. PC expenditures represent most of the hardware costs, and costs for support of the network represent about one-third of all networking. Support and training together constitute 46 percent of the total costs of networking schools,  and costs for telecommunications lines and services represent only 11 percent of the total costs. If all schools coordinate purchasing at the state level, cost savings will exceed $2 billion. If a nationwide program were instituted, potential savings would be $800 million to $1.8 billion. Free Internet connectivity would provide a reduction in total costs for school Internet connections between $150 million and $630 million. Financing for school networking remains to be adequately addressed. (Contains 13 references.) (GR)",

The discipline imposed by a financial bottom line imposes special pressures but also offers new opportunities. This private enterprise model is a multi-constructional process where language testing research and literature; English-as-a-Second-Language teacher-cum-test developers; a transient pool of teachers; non-language specialists, directors, managers, and accountants; and the ever-present need for performance-reliable second language assessment all play a role. Close interaction between researchers and practitioners is essential. Part 2 explains how opportunities to use data from such a test-in-development led to  more substantial and valid research designs that could be executed in-development to improve assessor training and reporting descriptors. There is a need to assess the impact of varied test formats and task features on interaction and to explore how these events vary in different cultural settings. The design of this test was an attempt to maximize the conversational style of interaction through features of computer-assisted test design, including a succession of holistic evaluations incrementing to a final score, reducing the processing and memory burden on the native speaking interlocutor, and positioning the evaluations at junctures that could allow the native speaking interlocutor to avoid sudden pre-closure and closure moves once the assessor has gotten what is needed from the  student. Minimizing topic hopping is essential to make the assessment more like a conversation than an interview. (KFT)",

        "description":"This paper investigates the writing revision strategies employed by Taiwanese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) college sophomores. Nine English majors participated in this study. Participants revised their second drafts based upon teacher feedback--both written and oral. Data were gathered from verbal self-reports, semi-structured oral interviews, and open-ended questionnaires. Analysis revealed three general ideas about written revisions emerging from the data: revising as submission, revising as meaning-negotiation, and revising as reposition. The data indicate that when students were able to take a critical stance to justify, negotiate, or even challenge teacher comments they were more likely to become critical thinkers, writers, and inquirers. This study strongly supports  the idea that student revision with teacher feedback is a social-cognitive process, and that when students are given opportunities to revise their writing with responses that resonate with their own experiences, beliefs, and values, they will see revision as a tool for managing their original drafts comfortably and confidently. It is concluded that one of the most important tasks for the writing teacher is to transfer the power of revising to the student. Extensive scholarly references to published research are made throughout the paper. (Contains 23 references.) (KFT)",

Related research questions included: What are current policies and guidelines for teaching first (L1) and second (L2) languages in each entity in the study? How are L1 and L2 taught in the primary grades? What is the relationship between L1 and L2 instructional practices and L1 and L2 student literacy? and What are the L1 and L2 proficiencies of the teachers in each entity? The results of the  study identified appropriate instructional practices and classroom language use patterns that relate to higher levels of student literacy achievement in the diverse linguistic and cultural settings of the Pacific.

        "description":"This paper describes the various barriers to comprehension that learners may encounter when viewing feature films in a second language. Two clusters of interfacing factors that may contribute to comprehension hot spots emerged from a quantitative analysis of problems noted in student logbooks. One cluster had a strong acoustic basis, whereas the other had a more cognitive or memory and attention basis. Acoustically-based misperceptions include the following: phonological misperception of consonant/vowel segments through addition/loss/substitution; misperception of proper nouns and foreign words and expressions; misperception based on loss, deletion, or substitution of entire syllables, especially if weakly stressed; faulty segmentation of word boundaries; phonological dialect or  foreign accent difference; what the listener expects or does not expect the interlocutor to say; the listener's lack of information (or correct information) with respect to the topic under discussion; and the speaker's use of idiom or colloquialism. Among the suggestions for mitigating these barriers to understanding are pre-teaching foreign words, technical language, idioms, and colloquialisms; sensitizing learners to varieties of spoken English; encouraging the learners to reflect on what their assumptions are about the target film's genre and structure; and segmenting the film into scenes and then clustering and labeling the scenes according to learner generated analysis.

The Internet has transformed communication around the world and can play a major role in the foreign language classroom. This digest illustrates how Internet software can enhance the classroom experience. In addition to the original Internet applications, like FTP (file transfer protocol) for moving files between machines and Telnet for logging into distant computers, the wide range of features and media (text, image, sound, video, multimedia) supported by the current crop of Internet programs makes them powerful additions to the foreign language teacher's repertoire. A number of Internet  applications are highlighted that can be used to enrich the foreign language classroom. (VWL)",

        "description":"This article describes and analyzes a task-based exercise in a college-level English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) class. This exercise required the learners to participate in the exchange of information and the accomplishment of one particular goal--in this case the construction of a Web page in English. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect data about the execution and completion of the task, including end-of-project survey results, brief student written responses about the approach, the resulting Web page, and group interview findings. Analysis of all four sets of data were positive. Constructing the Web page helped the students work together while communicating in English. Social interaction was also effectively integrated into the EFL curriculum,  offering a context for communicative use of the target language. The students had to make English language skills serve their own purposes as they endeavored to cooperatively construct the Web page. Based on the results, further investigation is recommended into the effects of specific steps involved in Web page construction on the social interaction and language learning in the second language classroom. Appendices include suggested EFL Web sites for students to explore, the Internet project questionnaire, and open questions about Web page construction. (KFT)",

        "author":["Cheng, Liying"],
        "description":"Washback or backwash, also known as measurement-driven instruction, is a common term in applied linguistics referring to the influence of testing on teaching and learning, which is a prevailing phenomena in education. It is a truism that &quot;what is assessed becomes what is valued, which becomes what is taught.&quot; This paper aims to share the discussion of this education phenomenon from different perspectives both in the area of general education and in language education. It discusses the historical origins of washback; the definition and scope of washback; and the function and mechanism of washback, and efforts, both recent and not, to mitigate its negative effects. It is concluded that the ultimate reason for the persistence and widespread nature of this problem is the existence of  high-stakes testing. Few educators would dispute the claim that these sorts of high-stakes tests markedly influence the nature of instructional programs. Whether they are concerned about their own self-esteem or their students' well-being, teachers clearly want students to perform well on such tests. Accordingly, teachers tend to focus a significant portion of their instructional activities on the knowledge and skills assessed by such tests. (KFT)",

        "author":["Clankie, Shawn M."],
        "description":"This paper examines efforts to save rapidly declining indigenous languages around the world. The entire process of language preservation and revitalization is a massive undertaking that requires immense long-term planning and support. These problems extend well beyond the linguistic concerns of the language itself. Language policy is inherently political in nature, pitting different linguistic (but also ethnic, religious, or cultural) groups against one another, any or all of whom may have reason to try to undermine any policy. This paper centers on these two distinct yet inter-related concerns in language revitalization efforts: directionality and policy preservation. The problem of directionality of language policy, the direction from which policy is generated and implemented,  namely, top-down (government-imposed) or bottom-up (grassroots public-imposed) is unavoidable. It is argued that neither approach can be entirely successful without the other and that the present societal structure where the language is to be used must be considered. The second problem, the question of how to preserve policy over time and through changes in government and leadership once a language policy has been agreed upon and is being implemented, is equally essential. Five suggestions are offered for preserving existing policy, while at the same time allowing the policy to grow and develop. Current research on this subject is reviewed. (Contains 11 references.)

        "author":["Clankie, Shawn M."],
        "description":"Genericization theory developed as a response to claims from outside of linguistics that generic use in brand names (for example, using Kleenex as a generic noun for all facial tissues, or Xerox for all photocopiers) is the result of marketing factors or misuse by consumers. This paper examines the linguistic factors that create an environment where genericization of a brand name could take place. These triggers of generic brand name change can provide insight into more traditional problems of semantic change, namely the problems of actuation, or how such changes begin, and whether there are types of semantic change that may be seen as regular or systematic. There are four primary hypotheses that form genericization: (1) Novelty--when a brand name for an innovative product and  the association of that item with its brand name become synonymous; (2) length and predominance--when the predominate brand name in a semantic class is shorter than the corresponding class-noun, and the brand becomes the generic for the entire semantic class; (3) genericization as a regular process--when the brand name change is a regular process that recurs in the same pattern; and (4) simple association--when there is a psychological association between a brand name and a single product (i.e. Rollerblades or Walkman).

        "description":"This paper argues that understanding the source and development of student motivation for learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) is very important for educational purposes. The purpose of this study of 234 Korean 9th graders was to identify the following: (1) Korean students' orientations and motivations for learning English; (2) what kinds of orientations could lead to motivations; (3) how new cognitive variables, such as confidence and attributions, are related to students' motivations; and (4) how gender relates to and affects student motivation. Methodologies employed included factor analysis to extract underlying motivations, Pearson product-moment correlations to assess relationships among these factors, and discriminate function analysis to examine the effects of  gender. The following findings are discussed: integrative reasons for second language learning are most significant; goal salience, attributions, and self-confidence are the main motivators; all orientations should be internally controllable by students before leading to motivations; and females consistently report higher integrative orientations and more positive attitudes toward second language learning. It is concluded that formal, extrinsic, classroom-related motivations were more important factors in second language learning than traditional integrative and instrumental motivations in Korean EFL contexts. Extensive quantitative empirical data and 64 references are included. (Author/KFT)",

To broaden the base of support for these students and to help address their academic needs appropriately, some schools have been partnering with community-based organizations (CBOs). This report outlines findings from a study of school/CBO partnerships that promote the academic achievement of language minority students. It describes the type of CBOs that partner with schools, the ways the partners work together, and the work they do. Crucial elements of program success are discussed, as well as the challenges that partnerships may face. The following recommendations  for developing effective partnerships came from partnerships described in this report. Partnership recommendations include assuring that potential partners are fully committed to the partnership and maintaining communication among partners. Program recommendations are threefold: ensure strong leadership at the program level; start small and build up carefully; and be on the look out for new opportunities. Finally, two important dimensions of successful partnerships deserve more scrutiny: the contributions of staff members who share the clients background, and the effects of partnership and program plasticity and the need to find the right balance between consistency and flexibility.

The program was a cooperative effort between a small town school district and Oregon State University at Corvallis. Teachers and researchers who entered into this project looked into the use of bilingual playwriting and puppetry within a primary and intermediate classroom with mainstream students, English language learners, migrant students, and students identified as having special needs. As they collected, analyzed, and compared their data, it was realized that bilingual playwriting and puppetry were greatly overshadowed by other common themes, including the following: the challenges of abbreviated summer school schedules and the pressure from  school district administrative personnel to be doing &quot;fun&quot; activities while keeping the focus on math and literacy; negative attitudes among elementary students toward Latino culture and the Spanish language; struggles with classroom management; and the rewards and benefits of team teaching. It was concluded that collaboration between a school district and a university is a good idea. This should be expanded and refined in the future to create quality programs incorporating democratic classroom practices, meaningful and purposeful curricula, team teaching, and continued collaboration between teacher researchers and university researchers.

Specifically, it examines, in light of the positions and prescriptions of Proposition 227 (an initiative holding that all California students be taught English as rapidly as possible, effectively mandating substantial revision in the operation and design of bilingual education programs in the state, and approved by the voters by a 61-39 margin in the election in June 1998), how educators of up and coming bilingual education professionals should prepare their students to deal personally and professionally with this emerging situation. The purpose of this study is to gain understanding of  how potential bilingual education teachers and researchers should grapple with the complex relationship of research, policy, and practice within the field of bilingual education. Specifically, what does it mean to focus on scholarship that strongly supports native language instruction when, at the same time, public opinion and policy are swiftly shifting in the opposite direction? Most importantly, what kinds of pedagogical experiences can be provided for these students to assist them in making sense of these incongruities? It is concluded that engaging these newly-minted professionals in their own research in bilingual settings, based upon their own questions, provides the best response. (KFT)",

This study reviewed undergraduate EFL student writings from three Japanese universities to identify common sentence structure aberrations. Four types of sentence structure aberrations were examined: fused sentences; run-on sentences; sentence fragments; and the use of coordinating conjunctions to start simple sentences. The goal of the study was to identify specific words associated with these sentence aberrations. The review revealed that the most common mistakes for the study group involved the use of the subordinating conjunctions &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot; to start simple sentences rather than to join independent clauses. The use or  omission of these words in other cases resulted in run-on or fused sentences. The second most common error was sentence fragments associated with the specific &quot;because&quot; clauses and &quot;for example&quot; lists. It is concluded that Japanese university level EFL writers in general need more instruction and writing assignments that involve the use of the coordinating conjunctions &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but,&quot; the subordinating conjunction &quot;because,&quot; and the introductory phrase &quot;for example.&quot; (Contains 15 references.)

Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were collected on various aspects of vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension of English language learners and English-only peers. In year one, the vocabulary knowledge of all students was tested, and a large gap between the English language learners and English-only students was discovered. A set of lessons was subsequently developed that was hoped would reduce the gap between the groups. In year two, the lessons (20-40 minutes long, offered 4 days a week for 12 to 15 weeks) were given to fourth graders at sites in three states. It was found that after 12 weeks of supplemental instruction the breadth of vocabulary knowledge was measurably improved, but reading comprehension was not noticeably improved. In year three, the intervention was again administered to the same students, now in fifth grade, and to a new group of fifth graders. Students receiving this extra instruction outperformed comparable students on measures of breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension. Students who received both years of instruction had a measurable boost in vocabulary knowledge, but not a significant difference in reading comprehension from those receiving only one year. Overall, English language learners in 2 years closed the gap with native speakers by about 50 percent--from about one to 0.5 standard deviations. It was concluded, therefore, that the extra instruction was quite effective. Extensive references and tables of quantitative data are included. (Contains 19 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"The United States has at least three historically established patterns of language use: English monolingualism, multilingualism, and bilingualism. The United States could best be described at present as a multilingual nation in which English is the dominant language. English is promoted to varying degrees, but linguistic diversity is tolerated. The purposes of this highly descriptive report are twofold. First, American linguistic diversity and language policy are surveyed to provide some of the important contexts and conditions of language education for language minority students. Second, in the process of examining the policy and processes of bilingual and English-as-a-Second-Language programs, the educational characteristics of language minority speakers, those students  designated as limited English proficient (LEP) are detailed in depth. A set of research questions is developed, and these questions are framed within the context of the Six Nation Education Research Project. These questions focus on how schools structure opportunities and incentives for language minority learners to acquire language and literacy and consider such things as ways to focus on the learner, how to account for economics and the sociopolitical context of language, the effects of national educational policies, and what policy modifications would enhance these opportunities and incentives. Numerous data-rich tables and figures give a thorough picture of American linguistic diversity and language policies, providing a solid framework for framing the research questions. Two  appendices and an extensive bibliography are included. (Contains 99 references.) (KFT)",

        "description":"The central concern of this paper is to discover the most effective way to maximize Japanese English-as-a-second-Language (ESL) learners' proficiency levels and communicative competence without compromising fluency and accuracy. The paper searches for the best approach for ESL instruction in Japanese high schools. The educational environment in Japanese high schools is examined, and the problems faced by Japanese teachers of English are considered. Next, the sequence of foreign language instruction is explained, emphasizing the focus on form theory because it is the dominant approach to ESL instruction in Japan, followed by a discussion of strategies that can be used by teachers for dealing with the errors made by students in the classroom. Finally, suggestions are made for how  Japanese teachers of English can adapt the focus on form theory in the Japanese high school ESL classroom. It is concluded that good judgment by the ESL teacher is crucial to find the proper balance between form- and meaning-focused instruction. Notes, references, and appendices are included.

        "description":"High dropout rates among language-minority secondary school students are one indication that many schools are failing to adequately support the needs of these students. The belief that the student dropout rate is due to a lack of proficiency in English often leads educators to overlook the economic, cultural, academic, and personal issues that immigrant adolescents must confront on a daily basis. To be effective, programs must begin with a compassionate understanding of these students and recognize and build on the identity, language, and knowledge they already possess. Instruction developed for native-English-speaking students may not be appropriate for students who are still learning English. To engage immigrant adolescents in school, educators must provide them with avenues to  explore and strengthen their ethnic identities and languages while developing their ability to study and work in this country. This digest discusses 10 principles for developing effective teaching and learning contexts for immigrant adolescents and profiles one program that has been successful in promoting the academic success of its students by implementing these principles.

The goals of the project are to help teachers assisting students in developing communication skills, encourage social interaction as a means of building language skills, increase cultural awareness among students, identify the role letters play in maintaining ties between family members, and teach students how to create and display an in-class exhibition of personal letters. Each of the activities explores the power and significance of family letters. Students will examine the writings of immigrant families from the past and compare them to their own personal experience and correspondence.  The class may share the experience with each other and the community by creating an exhibit that interprets the meaning of family letters. The project encourages adult ESL students to reflect on their shared experiences as immigrants and motivates them to continue building their English language skills. The project is designed to take up to eight sessions, which include the following topics: the value of letters, how letters bind families, translating and sharing letters, and the mechanics of beginning the exhibit-building process, discovering themes, labeling and mounting letters, and publicizing the exhibit and evaluating the experience.

Data must be collected to report learner gains in reading, writing, speaking, and listening, along with additional skills related to workforce assessment. Two assessment instruments were considered: the Oral Basic English Skills Test (BEST) and the CASAS. The Oral BEST is designed for adult ESL learners at the survival and pre-employment skills level. It uses real life materials and tasks to measure performance of basic language competencies. The CASAS is an older test, and is already well-established and accepted as a valid  and reliable assessment tool. For reasons provided in detail, it is concluded that the Oral BEST test would be the better choice by the Tennessee state government to use in fulfillment of federal requirements.

The guide's aim is to help people learn English so that they can participate actively in American democracy and to assert their rights and extract a larger share of power and resources from government and society as a whole. The book asserts that one of the primary purposes, historically, of adult education has been to prepare people for participation in a democracy. This might include English and civics lessons for newcomers who wanted citizenship, or literacy for emancipated slaves who faced literacy requirements erected to keep them from voting. In these situations, the vote has represented a powerful symbol  of liberation and inclusion. An argument is made for more direct forms of political action and participation than voting. The ultimate aim is to present a range of tools that can help readers examine their own beliefs about community, citizenship, and democracy, to identify and analyze issues that concern them, and build skills and strategies to take informed action--in brief, to become an agent rather than a recipient of change. The book is divided into five sections: \"Finding Connections to Communities and Issues\"; \"Holding Decision-Makers Accountable\"; \"Building a Community By Helping Others\"; \"Expressing Ourselves and Educating Others\"; and \"Organizing for Change.\" Extensive resources and references, print and Internet, and nine appendices are provided.

Through native speaker item validation and pilot testing, three subtests were developed and administered to 98 ESL learners of low-intermediate to advanced proficiency. Descriptive statistics and reliability estimates for the test administration are calculated, and the characteristics of the test items, subtests, and response modes were examined using traditional item analysis, Item Response Theory, and generalizability theory methods. Two of the three subtests were found to perform well as norm-referenced measures of construct, and areas for further testing and research were pinpointed.  Observed collocational knowledge was found to correlate strongly with a measure of general ESL proficiency, while length of residence had negligible predictive power of collocations on test performance. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that collocations items tended to load on different factors from general proficiency items, giving preliminary evidence of construct validity.

This study continues this work by exploring the benchmarks of affective behavior identified in the first study. &quot;Individual Acculturation and Language Learning&quot; (Vesna Dovis) is a case study of students on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, focusing on their various experiences of adjustment to life in America. A technical discussion of &quot;Spanglish&quot; is included. &quot;Cyber This and Cyber That: Negotiating Computer Learning&quot; (Suzanne Cockley) examines the ways 17 adult educators have learned to use their computers in instruction.

        "author":["Florez, MaryAnn Cunningham"],
        "description":"This very brief paper discusses whether and how to use the learners' native language in the English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classroom in the event that the instructor and all the students share the same language (Spanish in this case). The pedagogic disadvantages for ESL learners of being allowed to fall back on the native language are discussed. Several decisions regarding the uses of the learners' native language in class are highlighted. First, it was decided that use of Spanish by the instructor should be limited to classroom community building (exchanges that helped establish trust, congeniality, comfort in taking risks); affective support (discussions of difficulties, fears, confusion, victories); and discussion of fine or abstract points related to language and culture.  These are areas that are very important to the language learning process and that beginning level learners often have great interest in or need but have limited linguistic ability to address. On the issue of translating words or phrases, Spanish use was limited to providing context, clues, or prompts rather than direct translations. Next, regular observation and evaluation of Spanish use in the classroom was undertaken, leading to regular revision as the learners' English knowledge increased. Finally, the instructor talked directly to the learners about the use of Spanish in the class. It is concluded that this policy resulted in mostly positive experiences for the learners and the instructor. (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse for ESL Literacy Education) (KFT)",

        "description":"This monograph examines tenure and pay structures in Canadian universities, focusing on hiring, tenure, promotion, salaries, and termination; and examining the employment relationship from both economic and managerial perspectives. After briefly reviewing the concept of tenure, the discussion moves to career hierarchies and pay structures, including career ladders (hiring, tenure, and promotion), and wage structures (underpayment and overpayment of professors), which are examined from an employment contract perspective. The next sections focus on unique features of tenure (e.g., why so many candidates are hired for a single competitive tenure position or why those denied tenure must be asked to leave) and propose several alternative routes to tenure. Other topics considered are  whether standards differ for universities with a more egalitarian philosophy, and the rationale for tenure as a way of protecting faculty. A brief section looks outside the Canadian system to examine the German system of hiring professors. Other sections of the monograph discuss incentive structures and their design, particularly the tension between research and teaching, and the profound influence that tenure has on collective bargaining between faculty associations or unions and university administration. The final chapters offer suggestions for reform and discuss some of the implications. (Contains 56 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"The need to provide out-of-class options to students and to deal with student drinking led librarians at the State University of New York College at Fredonia to propose expanding library hours and implementing a cultural program series on Friday evenings. The project's goals were to foster support for academic programs and to offer students an alternative to spending Friday evenings binge drinking. Seven cultural programs, on topics ranging from gender issues in contemporary society to a discussion about summer research on asteroids at NASA in Houston, were offered. The extended hours were maintained on a pilot basis for 8 weeks. Program attendance and library usage were established as criterion measures, and data were collected using a people counter at the library's entrance  and tally sheets at the reference and circulation desks. Evaluation forms were prepared for the cultural programs and distributed at the end of each program. Results revealed that all performance criteria except number of reference questions asked were met or exceeded. The programs were well-attended, and evaluations were consistently high. Comments on evaluation forms asked that the cultural programming be continued and that extended hours be offered on Saturdays and during the week as well as on Friday evenings. Evaluation and attendance data are appended. (SM)",

        "description":"This paper describes the personalized system of instruction (PSI), a teaching method based on a high student involvement in the learning process, immediate feedback, mastery learning, and careful planning and instructional design of the course content. With PSI, students proceed through the course at their own pace and are required to demonstrate mastery of each component before proceeding to the next; teaching materials are largely text-based; proctors provide tutorial support; and lectures and demonstrations are intended to motivate students rather than deliver course content. PSI is deemed especially useful in courses where content is primarily skill development or cognitive information and for courses with large enrollments and limited resources. This paper describes use of  the PSI method in a computing course at Texas Tech University. Reported difficulties include: procrastination; difficulty in recruiting proctors; cheating on tests; organizing the course so that the modules are well-articulated and based on a logical hierarchy; complaints that learning small isolated bits of information inhibited synthesis of information; appropriateness of the PSI model for the course; a greater-than-normal instructor time commitment; changed teaching role; keeping module materials current; and varied student learning styles.

Sections of the paper review three cases in which foundations were ruled public entities; three cases in which foundations were found to be independent; and two hybrid rulings that provide additional insights. The paper also offers seven \"touchstones\" to help insulate an affiliated foundation from legal challenges to its privacy and independence. They include: (1) having an independent board of trustees; (2) not accepting rent-free space; (3) carefully spelling out arrangements for using university personnel; (4) retaining outside  legal counsel; (5) avoiding suspicion of wrongdoing and if challenged voluntarily releasing all pertinent information; (6) routinely releasing all information about public funds; and (7) having written agreements that set forth the terms of the foundation's working relationship with the university and affirming its independence.

Questionnaires were completed by 157 randomly selected male and female Pennsylvania State University and 176 University of Cyprus students. Students were asked 22 questions that measured intrinsic factors related to why they had chosen to major in elementary education; four questions asked for demographic information. Statistical analysis of the data revealed major differences between the two groups of students. American students were more influenced by intrinsic factors such as love of teaching and love of students, while University of Cyprus  students were more influenced by extrinsic factors such as guaranteed teaching positions, salary, and fringe benefits. There was also a clear difference in grade point average, with the Cypriot students scoring higher than the American students; this difference was consistent with the higher admissions standards in Cyprus. Copies of the questionnaire (in English and in Greek) are appended. (Contains 23 references.) (CH)",

The first section covers types of prevention programs that increase the probability of success. These programs include: campus-wide collaboration that involves athletics, health services, student activities, residence life, and campus security; strong administrative commitment; an established long-range plan; objectives tied to the institution's mission; networking outside the college community; building on institutional capacity by training faculty, staff, and students able to continue such activities without additional funding; program accountability; and  strategic use of public relations. The second section of the publication suggests ways to identify alternative sources of funding and offers suggestions for grant-writing. Advice on preparing a funding request, on seeking support from the alcohol industry, and on approaching foundations is included.

        "description":"This documents consists of two monographs, first published in 1973 and 1975, which examine the purpose and functions of institutional policy in dealing with the problems and issues affecting higher education. Their focus is conceptual, and the discussion looks to the philosophical, historical, and sociocultural underpinnings of institutional policy. The first monograph examines public policymaking process as it relates to administration, legislation, ideology, and theory, and also with policy functions and issues, examining planning, decision-making, and programs as functions of policy. The second monograph examines technological change, such as systems analysis, operations research, and management science, and its affect on policy. Two models for reconciling the basic conflict  between technology and public policy are offered. The first is a six-step synoptic model for general problem solving; the second heuristic model for political decision making is a group process in which the center of the model is the target for participants in the decision-making process and the action is an interchange rather than a sequential process. The paper concludes that while either model can be effective under some circumstances, the magnitude and complexity of problems to be solved require the complementary features of both models.

        "description":"This monograph examines use of standardized tests in higher education, particularly the Scholastic Assessment Tests (SAT), as an issue of social justice and the public interest and in the context of national concerns over access, equity, and demands for accountability. The paper notes public interest in access and equity beginning with 1930s concepts of &quot;democratic arithmetic,&quot; to the World War II era Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, and then the National Defense Education Act of 1958. In the postwar years, public interest focused on excellence in education and the concept of testing student aptitudes and abilities. In the late 1960s, concerns with social justice became paramount, and public expectations moved from concepts of equal educational opportunities, to  expectations of equal educational outcomes, to fairness in educational access and societal benefits. Since the 1980s, interest has focused on assessment of educational outcomes, and critics have argued against the SAT as an assessment measure. The paper holds, however, that in addition to its usefulness as a general measure of intellectual/academic competence, the SAT has many uses in academic decision making. But more importantly, the debate about the validity and usefulness of the SAT has contributed substantially to the clarification of public policies concerning access and equity.

Faculty at the school of education in a mid-Southern university were asked to complete the Van Tilburg/Heimlich Teaching Beliefs Scale and a demographic profile. The response rate was 57 percent, with 47 percent of the replies from male teachers and 53 percent from female teachers. Data analysis grouped respondents as: providers (low inclusion, high sensitivity, structured activities); facilitators (high inclusion, low sensitivity, subject-centered); experts (low inclusion, low sensitivity, subject-centered); enablers (high inclusion, high sensitivity, varied teaching practices); or neutral. The study found that 78 percent of all respondents preferred either the provider or enabler style; however, 53 percent  of females preferred teaching-learning decisions constructed by learners, and 65 percent of males used teaching styles that do not allow participants to freely share ideas. Male teachers were found to be more dominant and exacting in their teaching style, while female teachers tended to be more informal and open toward students. The study concluded that the central differences in teaching styles resided in issues of inclusion and control. (Contains 27 references.) (CH)",

A multi-site case study method was used; interviews were conducted with 11-16 individuals at each of four research I or II universities that had discontinued at least two academic programs within the last seven years. In addition to the interview data, other materials such as meeting minutes, institutional reports, speeches, and newspaper accounts were examined. Data analysis identified within-case and cross-case decision rules used. The study found that decision rules identified programs with weak or novice leaders, with low numbers of students and faculty, and which were not central to the&quot;college's&quot; mission. The study also suggests that most of the decision criteria are not used to select programs for closure; instead, programs closed were those that had few supporters and were unable to generate adequate political clout. Program closure also had little to do with external demand for graduates, anticipated enrollments, or internal demand for courses. Findings suggest instead that closure is based on action rationality rather than decision rationality. Appended are lists of programs closed and tables of criteria and decision rules by institution.

The first recorded reference to a moot court was in the year 997, and moots were common at the Inns of Court and Chancery in 14th century England. In 18th century England there were 4 greater Inns of Court and 10 lesser Inns, called the Inns of Chancery; in each of the greater Inns there were about 200 students, and 100 in the lesser Inns. Students learned not only law but history, scripture, music, and dancing, and several historians put the Inns of Court as universities for the study of law on the same footing as Oxford and Cambridge Universities. When formal legal education began in the United States in the late 18th and early 19th  centuries, the practices followed were similar to those of the Inns of Court, with lectures by professors followed by moot court exercises. This modified English system continued until the case method was introduced at Harvard Law School in 1870. Because students enjoy them, moot court competitions are still a viable part of the law school curriculum. (Contains 16 endnotes and 10 references.) (CH)",

The report calls for a new kind of public institution, one that is both a first-rate student university and a first-rate research university, that provides access to a diverse student population, reaches out to engage the larger community, and provides opportunities for lifelong learning. The Commission sees a national commitment to public education as: equal educational opportunity; excellence in undergraduate, graduate, and professional curricula; learning environments that meet civic needs; graduate education informed by scholarship and responsive to public needs; institutional resources brought to bear on community problems; data systems that  allow periodic assessment of progress toward goals; and on-going monitoring of the report recommendations. The report also sets out the public's responsibilities, urging enactment of new legislation that would help public universities create partnerships with public schools and revitalize K-12 education, as well as harness new telecommunications technologies to create a national learning society. It urges federal tax policy that encourages more private-sector partnerships with universities for joint research and educational activities and reminds states of their historic role of providing the major share of funding for public education.

        "description":"This study of the Western Governors University (WGU) suggests that its instructional model, based on distance education, could increase the value of teaching relative to research. The WGU model envisions a &quot;disaggregated faculty,&quot; that is, one in which faculty roles typically discharged by a single individual are delegated and outsourced to various specialists; curriculum development is assigned to program councils composed of outside experts; student assessment is assigned to other councils; advising is done by the WGU staff; and teaching of subject matter is done by instructors employed by approved educational providers. Using a model limited to distance education, this concept values teaching, rather than research or service, and functions with minimal governance. The study  suggests three reasons why the WGU model might result in teaching challenging the domination of research: (1) it offers institutions low in the traditional academic hierarchy an opportunity to develop a strong national reputation based on teaching alone; (2) it offers individual faculty members external validation of their teaching activities, thus enhancing their employment opportunities; and (3) it creates opportunities for an entrepreneurial teaching faculty. While the study notes that enrollment in WGU programs has not met expectations thus far, it concludes that the WGU model offers a new way of thinking about the future of higher education. (RAB)",

Most international students are considered developmental upon admission into postsecondary institutions. The success of these students has been attributed to the strength of their previous academic history, socioacademic integration, and institutional affiliation. Most suffer from empty nest syndrome, creating a need for career, familial, and occupational mediators. Successful multicultural educational programs and support services that emphasize developmental education have four holistic characteristics in common: (1) the programs address the whole student and present a whole academic process  to the students; (2) in programs that provide remediation and enrichment in basic skills, diagnostic and placement tools are integral components of the academic culture; (3) the programs emphasize comprehensiveness in support services and the organizational structure of the developmental education; and (4) most programs emphasize cultural programming that incorporates students' social and academic integration and institutional affiliation within the institutional environment and instructional climate. Five tables provide international student enrollment data and educational programs and support services designed for specific problems and needs. (Contains approximately 80 references.) (RH)",

Just as research is not done until it has been shared, this is true also of scholarship in teaching: it is not private, but public; it is made available to and is critically reviewed by peers; it can be built upon by others. To promote the scholarship of teaching, the Carnegie Foundation has created a new program called the Carnegie Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (CASTL), the three components of which are intended to enhance the scholarship of teaching in colleges and universities as well as in elementary and secondary schools. The first component, in conjunction with the Pew Scholars Program, is the creation of a Center for  Advanced Study, where those devoting energies to the scholarship of teaching have a place to work with others interested in the same problems. The second component, a collaboration with the American Association for Higher Education, is the development of 80 campus-based teaching academies. The third component is working with disciplinary and professional associations to ask how the scholarship of teaching can move from the periphery to the center in their discipline or profession.

Remediation and support programs, including summer bridge programs, have grown in response to the needs of international students, non-English speakers and disabled students, and others who need help in gaining an equal footing with other students. The other main thrust of these programs is to retain these new populations within higher education. The summer programs offer a wide range of activities: academic support, study skills, career counseling, parent involvement, developing relationships on campus, computer literacy, and partnerships with business, communities, and K-12 educators. Individualization of the curricula and programs to the needs of each campus is essential. Every program should begin by  developing a mission statement and goals that serve as the foundation of any evaluation, recognizing that it is not usually possible to offer all activities and to serve all populations. Bridge programs are also gaining support internationally, as other countries expand their higher education systems; many are looking to U.S. models, and our institutions need to support and nurture these programs.

The commission found: there has been a shift in responsibility for the financing of higher education to students and their families, with this burden increasingly being financed through student loans; institutional aspirations and  public expectations have a significant impact on cost; Missouri residents have access to a diverse system of public and private higher education institutions that offer a wide range of choices in terms of tuition and fee levels; state-level policymakers and the public have a limited understanding of institutional pricing policies and the reasons for the increasing costs of higher education; and because of various subsidies, no student pays the full cost of college. Charts and tables examine tuition costs and fees, and federal and state financial aid. The final section of the report presents the Commission's recommendations. (Contains 36 references.) (RH)",

It reports that the challenges and transformations experienced in recent years by community-based medical schools and clinical campuses offer a lens to the whole higher education enterprise, and asks the fundamental question of how the mission of education and community service can distinguish community health care in an increasingly complex and competitive market. It was expected that community-based medical schools and clinical campuses would help reverse the trend that disproportionately rewarded specialists compared to general practitioners. Increasingly, the search everywhere was for efficiencies and cost savings, giving rise to intrusions that  previously would have been unthinkable: third-party payers who decide when treatment is warranted and who will provide it; public plans to ration health care; a reduction in the number of hospital beds; and the rise of for-profit hospitals that promise to use market forces to reduce health care costs. As a result, community-based medical schools and clinical campuses recognize that they have to operate less like institutions whose missions command unrestricted financial support and more like enterprises that generate revenue from their capacity to deliver services at market price.

        "description":"This essay reports on a roundtable of higher education leaders, association heads, government officials, and public policy experts that examined the changes in policymakers' attitudes toward federally sponsored research. Since World War II national science policy has made universities the principal locus of basic research in the United States. But an increasing sense of disjunction between the values of the academy and the dispositions of the federal government reflects changes in a society increasingly skeptical of the claims to special treatment often made by colleges and universities. The intensified pace of the political process has led the federal government to allow markets to replace policy commitments intended to sustain traditional institutions' academic values and  processes. It matters less to Washington whether a student spends a Pell Grant attending a for-profit trade school or a traditional institution. This essay argues that for colleges and universities to succeed, they must become mission centered, market smart, and politically savvy: mission centered to find and adhere to central academic values and missions; market smart to promote coherence and cohesion; and politically savvy to understand the changed nature of the political process in which only a limited number of goals can be achieved.

While colleges and universities are built on the premise that good data, well tested by an often adversarial process of discovery and verification, can yield fundamental truths about how things work and how they ought to, most institutions have yet to learn how to use data strategically. The practice uses data for narrow and parochial causes, often to protect the existing order; seldom is data used as the instrument of strategy, that is, to gauge the capacity of an institution to fulfill current commitments or pursue new opportunities, to understand external markets and  the competition for new or existing programs and services, to analyze the opportunities for new ventures through collaboration among departments and centers, or to explore the prospect of even broader collaboration with other colleges and universities. The essay suggests use of a matrix of domains and capacities to support strategic decision making and development of a national data base centered on collective performance to demonstrate responsibility for service to the public.

After a series of meetings of administrators and faculty leaders, the Board agreed to take the question of tenure off the table, provided that post-tenure review policies be developed that would give the institutions the power to take prompt corrective measures when faculty performance was less than satisfactory. The Board of Regents wanted a process that included an external reviewer and that had common principles for the whole system. After consensus was reached on the new policy, leaders at Arizona State  University were faced with the challenge of selling the post-tenure review process to the faculty. Trust between administration and faculty was a key element in forging the policy that was approved by the faculty. The plan that was developed preserved the concept of academic freedom, recognized the importance of tenure to the institutions and faculty, built on the existing system of annual performance review, and was not punitive, but a process that enabled faculty to overcome identified deficiencies.

Through the initiatives of the South Dakota Board of Regents, which is the governing authority, they have moved from a system that funds institutions by enrollment to one that provides base funding with incentives for performance. The universities undertook a program to eliminate under-enrolled classes and reinvest the savings in faculty development and technology. A new series of councils links the research and teaching activities of the six faculties. The institutions' progress in working together more effectively addressed concerns of the state's elected officials and business leaders, who felt that the institutions were inefficient and  incapable of change. Under mandate from the Board of Regents, they also began to recast their separate general education requirements around a coherent set of learning goals that students would be expected to achieve at any of the six universities. The number of general education courses was reduced from 520 to 130 across the system, and students are required to complete general education requirements in foundation-level courses in their first 2 years.

        "description":"This monograph discusses some of the difficulties that colleges and universities encounter when they seek to study themselves. It finds that despite commendable efforts to establish doctoral programs in higher education, institutes and centers for the study of higher education, and offices of institutional research, there are many discrepancies between what is known and what is believed about institutions of higher learning. The most publicized criticism of educational research has been its inability to demonstrate the effectiveness of federally funded programs. The essay goes on to examine the establishment of centers for research in higher education as part of the movement to support research on issues and problems related to postsecondary education, and the later shift of  federal funding which directed research toward evaluation, planning, and management. The essay also examines the role of institutional research for data-gathering and reporting, as well as for organizational and operational purposes, concluding that educational research has not had any sustained influence in the reform of education at any level. The essay concludes that higher education is, nonetheless, worthy of study with the best of scholarly methods, and that as a field of doctoral study, higher education should be the \"study of institutions.\" (CH)",

        "description":"This monograph argues that university status should be conferred on colleges only when they have reached a specified level of achievement within their various academic programs, and that when changes are made in an institution's administrative structure and academic organization, something other than institutional aspirations should serve as the criteria. The essay defines some of the distinctive features of university status, including patterns of instruction, research, and service; recruitment and education of students capable of becoming scientists, scholars, and professionals; and the existence of facilities (libraries, laboratories, computer centers, museums) essential to a higher-level academic environment. Also noted are the significant differences between universities and  other institutions on the applications and uses of knowledge, and the indicators of status and image. The essay concludes that a university is worthy of its name when: most of its constituencies appreciate its mission and role as an institution of higher learning; curricula include humanities and fine arts, physical and biological sciences, behavioral and social sciences, and professional or applied fields of specialization; governing boards represent the public interest; heritage, tradition, and current programs give a unique sense of purpose and meaning; and the university displays maturity and the capacity for continuing growth and development.

        "description":"This monograph looks back at the 20th century, seeking to learn about the present by learning from the past. One challenge to institutions of higher learning today is the denial of the intellectual and cultural heritage of the university as a time and place to study and learn, as a community of scholars and scientists, and as a place where knowledge is created, disseminated, and used. The essay challenges those who denounce &quot;rote learning,&quot; noting that personal, collective, and institutional memory are essential for comprehension and understanding. The past is where we find it and what we make it. When we recall and use the past to learn about the present, we must do so on the premise that what we learn is related to how we use collective and personal memory and how we study and  apply what we recall. The essay concludes that the social, cultural, and educational consequences of 20th century discoveries, inventions, and innovations provide an incentive to learn about the past, and to comprehend and use the knowledge gained.

Sixteen data tables and 7 figures are included. The study found that students' native language played a major role in determining the need for remediation; that remedial students narrowed the academic performance gap as compared to nonremedial students during the normal 4-year period of college study; and that  students with a greater need for remediation required a longer period of retention. The second paper discussed practical concerns of grade inflation. Findings revealed that adjunct faculty gave higher grades than full-time faculty; that faculty rank had only a marginal effect on grading; that grades in the humanities and social sciences were higher than in science and technology; and that the higher the course level, the higher the average grade.

        "description":"This study points out the similarities between the backgrounds of corporate chief executive officers (CEOs) and academic deans. It notes that most CEOs are fairly well educated white males who rose through the ranks of middle management to reach their current positions; the typical dean has a doctoral degree, has often been a department chair or associate dean, and is white, male, and middle-aged. This study explores the influences--parental expectations and participation in school and college leadership activities--that relate to adults as leaders, examining these findings in relation to a study of academic deanship conducted by the Center for Academic Leadership at Washington State University. Almost 70 percent of respondents in the latter study characterized their parents as  stressing high standards of excellence during their formative years. Most deans also participated in one or more youth leadership activities, with the majority choosing community-oriented activities. This paper finds that the formative experiences of academic deans and corporate CEOs are similar; parental expectations for both groups are high; both groups have comparable academic backgrounds, and both groups hone their leadership skills in high school and college. Therefore, the paper suggests, reciprocal networking and mentoring between corporations and universities could benefit all those involved. (Contains 27 references.) (CH)",

The seven new professors in the study were asked to engage in ethnographic interviews that described and categorized their experiences, and contrasted them with other events. Interview questions focused on: descriptions of experiences; mentors in the university; differences between teaching in elementary/high schools and in higher education; challenges of being new professors; and benefits of being in a cohort of new professors. The study found that the responses of the new professors differed considerably. While some found the mentor relationship satisfactory, others did not. Reactions to the usefulness of orientation meetings and a course on  university instruction found the former welcoming but the latter not useful. Other factors or experiences which were helpful in acclimatizing to university life included helpful senior faculty, office mates, the division chairperson, key office staff, and being part of the cohort itself. The paper concludes that those experiences that were based on personal connections and two-way communication, rather than formalized institutional events, were most useful in promoting acclimatization to the university setting.

Student interviews focused on how students interpreted the service experience in relation to the course, that is, the connections between academic course material and the community work/service experience; the role reflection played in the course and in their personal and academic development; and the things they did in and out of class to help connect the service  experience and the formal course content. The study found that it is essential to provide structured, intentional reflection in service-learning courses, and that reflection enhances learning by connecting the service experience to the academic course.

Data for the study was derived from the 1994 Freshman Survey and 1998 College Student Survey conducted annually by the Higher Education Research Institute for the Cooperative Institutional Research Program. The sample for the study included over 4,000 students attending 76 four-year institutions; the primary dependent variable was a self-rating on changes in religious beliefs and convictions. Sections of the study cover the introduction, objectives, methodology, results, limitations, and discussion and conclusion. Some study results were contrary to what had been anticipated, e.g. while students tended to experience  changes in religious beliefs, the direction of change was toward a strengthening of convictions. The study also supported past findings that students who experienced a weakening of religiosity tended to be liberal males with negative emotional health experiences; females having positive emotional health were more likely to experience a strengthening of beliefs. One unexpected finding was that religious affiliation does not necessarily make a direct difference in students' religious convictions. The study suggests increased student-faculty interactions and support for religious student organizations and activities as ways to strengthen students' religious beliefs. (Contains 25 references.)

This longitudinal research project at the University of Cambridge (England) sought to determine the reasons for the disparity in numbers of first-class degrees awarded to women at Cambridge compared to other United Kingdom universities. The research questions focused on the perspectives/meanings reported by men and/or women within the institution; the different gender choices associated with different values or perspectives on society, with self-concept, and with institutional social processes; and the difference in gender choices and changes over time. The paper examines issues of&quot;democratic exchange&quot; in CMC interviews, and discusses the lack of physical cues, anonymity, and how social status or personality are projected within the constraints of an e-mail exchange. The paper also examines questions of on-line authenticity, noting that electronic networking opens possibilities for deception, and that there was no mechanism to ensure that messages continued to come from the same person over time. The study concludes, however, that rapport via e-mail interviews is possible, and that researchers and participants can find ways to compensate for the loss of embodiment. (Contains 37 references.)

        "description":"This paper describes an e-mail-based correspondence project between 56 pairs of university-school partners: pre-service teachers enrolled in a multicultural education course, and middle school students enrolled in language arts classes in a culturally diverse, economically depressed community. The purpose of the critical action research project was to offer the pre-service teachers an opportunity to interact with students of diverse cultural backgrounds and to offer the middle school students an interesting way to engage in literacy development. Partners corresponded with each other for 10 weeks. Data examined includes letters written during the 10-week period, end-of-semester pre-service teacher project reports, weekly instructor field notes, faculty/pre-service student dialogue  journals, and a questionnaire completed by middle school students at the conclusion of the project. Positive outcomes were seen in both student populations, including a broadening of multicultural awareness and improvements in skills development. The paper also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of technologically mediated communication. One disadvantage noted was the difficulty students had in interacting with someone they had not met; it was suggested that correspondents should be allowed to meet at the beginning of the correspondence.

Three groups of students participated in the study: 22 at-risk freshmen who were taught learning strategies in a linked strategy-instruction course; 22 students who had previously taken a remedial reading course; and 184 regularly admitted freshmen and upper level students. The linked learning strategies course was an intensive introduction to studying in college, and students were taught to monitor reading comprehension using annotated marginal study questions. All three groups of students completed the Student Activity Questionnaire (SAQ) at the end of the psychology course. Data were analyzed to correlate and  compare students' grades in the psychology course with SAQ scales that measured levels of cognitive processing, representation, memory augmentation, effort management, initiative, and efficacy. The at-risk students who received strategy instruction earned grades similar to the regularly admitted students. For all students, grades in the psychology course had a high positive correlation with levels of self-efficacy for academic learning in college; for the linked and regularly admitted students, grades in the course had a high positive correlation with levels of cognitive processing and effort management.

The study examines how the use of the different types of scholarships has changed in recent years; characteristics of students who receive the grants; and whether race and gender are related to the awarding of grants. The sample for this study included full-time dependent students from four-year public and private research, doctoral, comprehensive, and liberal arts institutions; proprietary school students and students who received athletic scholarships were excluded. Bivariate analysis of the data demonstrated that white students were awarded a disproportionately large share of  non-need grants in both study years, with their share increasing between 1989 and 1995. Multivariate analysis found that gender had little to do with the awarding of institutional grants; that race was more of a determining factor in the awarding of grants, with the effects differing by type of institution and region; that African Americans were more likely to receive non-need grants; and that in 1995 Hispanics and Asian Americans in private colleges were more likely to receive non-need awards than were other students.

A sample of deans (n=695) in the colleges of education, business, liberal arts, and nursing at 360 public and private institutions was surveyed and asked to identify and rank order the three biggest challenges they expected to face in the next three to five years, and to rate how effectively they thought they would address each challenge. Seven general categories of anticipated challenges were identified: fiscal, administration, curriculum and program development, faculty, technology, personal balance, and diversity. The three rated most important were: (1) fiscal; (2)  administration; and (3) curriculum and program development. Significant differences were found across the challenges, but no significant differences were found among deans grouped by minority status, institute type, and institutional rating. Regarding administrative challenges, older deans (age 50) and those with less than two years experience tended to see themselves as more effective than those who had longer tenure.

After reviewing other research on the subject, the report examines informal and formal mentoring; concepts of sponsorship and mentorship and the influence of tenure; networking; coaching; mentoring relationships (of women and as related to race  and ethnicity); and deans and mentoring. The study reports that while deans benefit from mentoring, regardless of race or gender, less than 50 percent receive mentoring support. It was found that the greatest obstacle to mentoring is that it is a predominantly voluntary, unrecognized, and unrewarded system that requires a great deal of initiative to begin and to maintain the relationship for both the mentee and the mentor.

Findings indicate that women and minorities remain underrepresented in deanships; noting that female representation in this study is skewed because half of the respondents were deans of nursing colleges. It was also found that deans do not follow a set career trajectory, and that most groups of deans did not see their position as a natural stepping stone to the provost position (more than 25 percent planned to return to faculty positions).

The questionnaire's five sections included: academic and social aspirations, gender equality in employment and work ethics, self-evaluation, life-course selection, and demographic information. Respondents included 111 undergraduates at the University of Guam and 131 undergraduates at two universities in Japan. Multiple regression analyses measured the association of status aspirations with the life course selection. The study found the ranking of status aspirations  similar in both groups, but found the magnitude significantly different, with Guamanian women overall aspiring much higher than Japanese women. Similarly, in measures for occupational ethics, rankings were similar but magnitudes were significantly different. The correlation of variables on the relationship of life course selection with status aspirations was moderate. For Guamanian women, the contributing factors were getting married and having a child; for Japanese women, having a profitable job and becoming a mentor for the next generation were the contributing factors.

The project seeks to develop and understand the use of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) technologies for supporting distributed learning communities via the World Wide Web. In the expedition examined, participants were challenged to come up with solutions on how to design, develop, and market wireless communication for cars, providing drivers with personalized information, messaging, entertainment, and location-specific travel and security services. Participants  conducted their activities through a Web site providing a coordinated set of CSCL tools facilitating communication, information access, collaboration, and knowledge representation. Participants were 45 youth (children of Motorola employees) from 13 to 17 years old. Research questions addressed the learning experiences of participants, the teaching experiences of online mentors, and the function of the CSCL tools. Data were collected through online non-participant observation, electronic surveys, questionnaires, interviews, chat room observation, transcripts of forum entries, and project artifacts collection. Results show that substantial associations exist among youths' attributions, interest and participation, and team functioning. Contains 21 references. (MES)",

By focusing on a specific change related to the integration of ICT, the research explored two primary questions: (1) What factors facilitate or inhibit organizational learning? and (2) What are the sources of leadership that influence organizational learning and what is the nature of that leadership? Of the 15 schools studied, 6 were identified as innovative, 4 as moderately innovative, and 5 as static. Findings are described in detail for each of these three categories. The study provides empirical evidence to show that changing school practices, such as  using ICT in teaching and learning, is very much dependent upon the level of organizational learning in a particular school. Findings also present evidence that formal planning processes provide continuity of organizational learning only if there exists a critical mass of leadership to facilitate the process.

A valuable exercise in the Web-based course for helping students identify what type of research methods are being used would be for students to investigate journals in their academic discipline, find a research article related to a topic of interest, and critique the article. An important lesson that students can learn in a Web-based course is that they make a personal choice when selecting a research method, that conducting research is a privilege, and that there are consequences involved when conducting research.

(Animated Dissection of Anatomy for Medicine) multimedia software and PowerPoint presentation software during the first and second quarter of the 1997-98 school year. Each of the students in Group A was given full-time possession of a laptop computer, including permission to take it home. Group B served as a control group and did not have access to the laptop computers, although MedWorks software and the Internet were available on five workstation computers in the science classroom. Access was reversed for the second half of  the year and Group B students used the laptops while Group A served as the control group. Instruction for both groups centered on lectures, lab activities, and open-ended projects. The study demonstrated that students learned more when they had access to laptop computers, were exposed to multimedia software, and created projects with presentation software.

The extent to which businesses are getting involved in new policy forms and the nature that resulting government/industry links are taking are explored. The paper also examines how key players are emerging and the interests of some firms dominating over others. Above all, the paper is concerned with how the public/private  foundation for the NGfL is working out in practice. The paper is based on a series of in-depth interviews with key actors in the formation and initial implementation of the NGfL initiative, including: officials from the coordinating government department, DfEE (Department for Education and Employment); officials from the quasi-government agency responsible for developing and delivering aspects of the initiative, the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency; policy advisors to the Prime Minister and DfEE; as well as key executives in information technology and telecommunications firms and their educational representative body, the British Educational Suppliers Association.

The course, &quot;Integrating the Internet across the Curriculum,&quot; was offered by Indiana University Bloomington as a 6-week summer course in 1999. As a World Wide Web-based course, it was available to a worldwide audience of K-12 educators in graduate or certification programs. The focus of the paper is on the general learning experience, particularly during the PBL portion of the course. The course was observed online, and additional information was obtained from students through e-mail questions and telephone interviews, and from the instructors through telephone  interviews. Results are presented related to: the constructivist learning environment; individual learning and experience; group learning experiences; assessment and grading; developing an atmosphere of trust and collaboration; problem-solving student issues online; and design and implementation of PBL. Technology interface considerations related to these learning and teaching issues are outlined. A decision-making model for online PBL courses is presented that addresses student, teacher, curriculum, technology, and structural contextual issues. Contains 20 references. (MES)",

        "description":"Spatial context can be expected to play an important role in computer-based instruction and distance education using PC terminals because these types of computer-mediated instruction often occur in a restricted environment such as one's home or office. These settings, while convenient, are often isolated and lack diverse spatial cues. Fundamental research studies suggest this should result in negative effects for memory. This study investigated whether diversifying the setting in which computers are used as instructional tools would address this problem by creating more cues for retrieval of information. Participants (n=71) read three computer-based instructional units, each describing a different city. These city units were presented on a computer in a single site or in three  diverse sites. The three learning sites were made more visually distinct on several dimensions, including decorative arrangements. All participants were tested for attribution recall at a new neutral site. Results confirmed the prediction that diversification of computerized learning sites improves recall, i.e., participants in the diversified learning sites performed better on the attribution memory test than students in a single learning site. Individual differences in sensitivity to background cues, as measured by the Group Embedded Figures Test, were not found to interact with test performance. (Author/MES)",

The initiative began in 1995 when the school district of 44,000 students funded 5 computers and a color printer for each elementary classroom in 34 schools. The goals of the initiative focused on: increasing student performance; addressing different learning styles; providing students with daily access to computers; increasing student proficiency with computers; and preparing students for the future. To accomplish these goals, teachers were required to acquire the capacity to integrate computers into their daily classroom lessons, and the school division needed to install and maintain the hardware and courseware required to support teacher efforts. Data were collected through  classroom observations, teacher surveys, and focus group interviews. Data were then organized and analyzed to examine the impact of computers on teacher capacity to integrate computers into their instructional strategies, attitudes, and beliefs, and teacher instructional and work behaviors. The implementation of the initiative was evaluated in each of the three years since 1995 in order to provide information to the school district for use in planning, work tasks, and staff development. Teacher attitudes, ability, and instructional behaviors were sampled, as well as their perceptions of student motivation and performance due to the initiative. Student achievement was not reviewed until the third year of the study. A copy of the teacher questionnaire is appended. (Author/MES)",

The vast majority of Community College System awards are one of the following four types: Associate in Arts (AA), Associate in Science (AS), postsecondary vocational certificate (PSVC), and postsecondary adult vocational certificate (PSAV). AA degrees have increased 23.8% from 1993-94 to 1997-98. AS degrees increased by 1.7% during this same time period. Certificates also increased during this time period. PSVC increased by 20.6%, and PSAV increased by 3.9%. The initial quarterly earnings for community college graduates ranged from $6,013 for AA graduates to $7,739 for AS graduates. Seventy-five percent of AA graduates transferred to  the State University System. A comparison of initial outcomes for the 1995-96 versus the 1996-97 graduates shows that Florida is employing more and supporting less. There were increases across the board in the percent of graduates found employed in Florida for 1996-97 compared to 1995-96. The percent of students receiving public assistance has declined for all groups. Florida Education &amp; Training Placement Information Program also has  been tracking the 1990-91 graduates over the past six years. All groups experienced an increase in their average quarterly earnings. The largest increases were for the highest degrees. Eleven tables are appended, which use data from the Florida Education &amp; Training Placement Information Program. (VWC)",

Some of the trends are outlined below. The  largest growing fields of interest for students at PGCC are areas related to technology and technical training. Another fast growing trend is the growth of distance and on-line learning. The number of remedial students served by the college continues to grow. PGCC enrolls an ever-increasing number of minority students. A review of the trends in revenue over a six-year period shows a decline in the proportion of the budget contributed by the county. The Maryland Higher Education Commission asked that PGCC account for a decline in the percent of restricted budget allocation to instruction, from the academic year 1994-95 to the year 1995-96. The percent of African-Americans on the full-time faculty has remained relatively stable. It is clear that the success rate of African American students  has increased over time. (VWC)",

The study begins with a description of student costs and then describes five types of financial resources available to students to help them meet those costs. The five resources are parent contribution, student contribution, grant programs, loan programs, and work programs. Special attention is given to the way that each resource is distributed among students. Total resources (that is, all five types of resources, combined) are then compared to total cost, and the shortfall between total resources  and total cost is noted. Finally, a special analysis provides a progress report on one of the Indiana State Commission for Higher Education's state-level performance objectives. Under this performance objective, the Commission has sought to narrow the gap by which combined parent contribution and grants/scholarships fall short of total cost, for the poorest of students. The analysis reports that progress is not being made. (VWC)",

Most county high school seniors view PGCC positively. More county high school graduates attend PGCC than any other college. Adult residents of the county familiar with the college regard it favorably, particularly as a place to start college and as a place for the less advantaged to attend college. However, nearly three in five county adults are not familiar with PGCC. Though popular with county high school students, the community  college is not the first place the business community thinks of when selecting workforce-training providers. And though county residents in general support the college--as evidenced by bond referenda, for example--most are unfamiliar with the college's programs and personnel. Those who know the college rate it highly, but many remain unaware of what it has to offer. (VWC)",

The purpose of this study was to determine if a semester-long community-college course designed to increase critical thinking skills could help students attain more sophisticated levels of epistemological beliefs. A secondary purpose of this study was to examine the relation between teachers' epistemological beliefs and the resulting epistemological beliefs of their students. The results did not support the research questions. Neither the course nor the teachers' level of epistemological beliefs was found to relate to students' epistemology. These implications help identify classroom practices that increase student success in college. One possible way  for instructors to identify effective classroom practices is to link their teaching goals to classroom assessment. Also effective for instructors interested in increasing students' epistemological beliefs is the importance of instructor feedback to students. In addition, instructors can construct tests and assignments that foster integration of knowledge. Specific discussions and written self-reflections about epistemology among teachers and students can, at the very least, make students aware of their beliefs. Teachers also need to be aware of the forces impeding higher-order thinking skills, evaluation and integration of knowledge, pressures such as grades and coverage of course materials.

        "description":"The need for a mathematics placement test was acknowledged because a number of students registered in introductory algebra (Math 110) were struggling with problems involving only arithmetic operations. A placement test was selected with the intention to effectively detect students with arithmetic deficiencies and place them in a remedial mathematics class that would be called Mathematics 100. At the beginning of fall semester 1983, most of the Mathematics 110 teachers administered the Mathematics (100/110) Placement Test to 150 students. The scores were recorded and kept. The idea was to monitor the students and compare their course performance with their placement test scores. The purpose of this paper is to describe how the data was organized, analyzed, and interpreted. It was  found that 83% of the students who scored at or above a 44 on the placement test received a grade of C or better in Mathematics 110, compared with 46% of those who scored below 44. In light of the data and analysis presented in this report, the use of the placement test is warranted. Clearly, with its use, students can be placed much more effectively in Mathematics 100 and Mathematics 110. Its continued use will alleviate much frustration on the part of the students and teachers.

The report looks at two types of completion rates: the rate derived by considering only completions at the entering institution is labeled the Native Award Rate; while the rate based upon all completions is labeled the Total Award Rate. An additional aim of this report was to provide information by initial programmatic intent. The cohort used in this study includes first-time-in-college and dual enrollment students who were award-seeking in fall 1993. The Native Award Rate for full-time students with an initial intent of an Associate in Arts  degree was 23.3%. This rate increased to 25.3% for the Total Award Rate. The part-time results were 8.2% for Native Rate and 9.5% for Total Rate. Students seeking an Associate in Science degree had a Native Award Rate of 16.8% for full-time and 7.9% for part-time. The Total Award Rates were 17.7% and 8.9%, respectively. All of the selected characteristics appear to impact completion rates. Students with an initial intent of a certificate were completing at almost twice the rate of those students whose initial intent was a degree. The difference between Native and Total rates was fairly small at the system level, but, as the attached charts indicate, the difference for some colleges was significant. (VWC)",

The college measures institutional effectiveness through Goal Attainment Scaling, a flexible measurement process designed to develop criteria for assessing each program, student service, and academic unit. The components of institutional effectiveness include the following: general education, majors and concentrations, academic advising, 2-year to 4-year transfer, student development, and library resources. In 1998-99, assessments were conducted within general education, majors and concentrations, and student development. In General Education, the majority of outcomes met or exceeded expectations based on course scores, instructor scores, course  success rates, common final exams, and an umbrella indicator of expanded awareness of a global/multicultural society. In terms of Majors and Concentrations, all eight programs assessed met or exceeded benchmarks for the majority of indicators based on enrollment, student satisfaction, and student success as well as job placement, employer satisfaction and other outcomes. For Student Development: Testing Services met or exceeded 15 of 15 indicators; Learning Assistance Services had satisfactory measurements in terms of customer awareness/satisfaction, effectiveness of services, and employee excellence. Report contains one table showing associate degree competencies for various programs. (RDG)",

        "description":"This study examined the adjustment process of 727 students who transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in fall 1994 or fall 1995. The Transfer Students' Questionnaire (TSQ) was organized into three main sections: social demographics, perceptions of the community college experience, and perception of the UCLA experience. The methodology compares the responses of the students who had participated in honors programs at their community colleges (TAP students) with those students who had not participated in one of these programs (non-TAP students). The study found that TAP students tend to be white, younger, come from families with higher parental education attainment and income levels, and have higher degree aspirations than their non-TAP counterparts. At the  community college, TAP students had higher GPAs and were more likely to spend their free time engaging in extracurricular activities, while non-TAP students were more likely to spend their free time reading for pleasure or doing independent research. Also at the community college, TAP students were more likely to consult with academic counselors on a regular basis. At the university, TAP students continued to have higher GPAs than non-TAP students. Both groups expressed similar levels of satisfaction with UCLA and showed similar levels of involvement at the university. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of psychological, academic, or social adjustment. (Contains 60 references.) (CAK)",

The 464 graduates responding to the survey have fared quite well since graduating. The mean salary of those employed full-time is $29,755. Two-thirds reported being employed, which is slightly less than last year's graduating class. Of those employed, however, slightly more reported being employed full-time than the previous year. A review of the demographic characteristics such as gender, ethnic background, and age of the entire Class of 1998 reveals several changes from previous graduating classes. For example, there are fewer female and more Hispanic students, and the percentage transferring to a four-year college remained nearly constant. The report presents results of those  attending college full-time, degree aspirations, and factors facilitating transfer. The study reports on satisfaction with jobs and location of employment. Respondents continue to give high marks to the college on several broad questions (overall college experience, courses in major, and availability of courses). Respondents were also asked to rate their satisfaction with 20 of the college's services. Library services, computer services, tutorial services, and reading and math skills facilities received the highest percentage of very satisfied responses from students. A large percentage of respondents indicated that their goals (employment, transfer, academic, and personal) had been met by their college degree.

The study also examined the extent to which academic aspiration is influenced by factors such as background characteristics, high school experiences, and other affective  measures. For each of the two groups, being female, father's education, mother's education, and parental income revealed positive associations with high aspirations for students at public and private two-year colleges. Additionally, younger students were more likely than older students to have higher academic aspirations. High school experiences such as years of mathematics, foreign language, and biological science, high self-ratings of academic ability, drive to achieve, and intellectual self-confidence were significant variables.

By narrowing the focus to the geographical area of the Pacific/ Western region, the study seeks to identify the development of international cultural connections consistent with the region and to explain how the globalization process affected college behaviors. Seven colleges were visited twice by a team of researchers over a two-year period. Interviews were conducted with key personnel. The researchers found that in the 1990s, community college leaders embraced a liberal technological philosophy of education, which assumes that education is instrumental and that the technology is part of a global economy where advanced education is best oriented to skills  development and marketplace relevance. As a result, the mission of the community college became oriented to economic concerns and to the requirements of the private sector. The new vocationalism in the community college mission addressed the needs of the middle class and the engines of the economy. The institutions' mission also encompassed the acquisition of resources and the prudent ministering of their own financial resources. Colleges also gave considerable attention to multiculturalism and diversity, as reflected in hiring practices, curricula, and extra-curricular activities. (Contains 30 endnotes.) (JA)",

While HSPT scores for county high school districts reflect a range of competency in reading, math, and writing, the majority of Hudson County Community College (HCCC) students (71%) come from districts (Jersey City, Union City, and Guttenberg/West New York) that in general do not perform well on the three sections of the HSPT. When one considers the weak academic foundation of so many of the college's students, it should come as no surprise that a large number of students must take courses to develop basic math/English skills and that retention is a challenge  for the college. The college must keep these results in mind as it projects needed resources to help upcoming, underprepared students make the transition to college readiness. Indeed, over the course of its history, HCCC has committed resources and sponsored a number of programs and initiatives designed to assist students in developing college ready skills. (JA)",

        "description":"Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) is a sound academic practice that contributes to adult learning by linking formal and informal learning. However, it has not been widely accepted by Canadian educational institutions. In 1996, a consortium of seven colleges and an independent PLAR consultant began a study to create a comprehensive database of PLAR learners and their characteristics, identify PLAR activities in participating institutions, analyze the effects of PLAR on students and the institutions, and compare the costs of credits achieved through PLAR with those produced through traditional course delivery. Study results found that: the average course grades of PLAR learners are as high or higher than those of traditional students in the same programs; PLAR  strengthened adult learners' confidence and represented important efficiencies for part-time adult learners by shortening their programs; the low number of PLAR learners and programs signal that delivery of PLAR has not been economical for some institutions;  early benefits from PLAR training within institutions diminished over time; and there is a need for greater public awareness of PLAR. The report concludes with a series of recommendations addressing institutions, public policy makers, adult learners, and workplaces. (Contains 30 references, 31 tables and charts, and 14 appendices.)

The primary report used in preparing this analysis was Hudson County Estimated and Projected Employment by Occupation, 1996-2006 (hereafter Projected Employment), which provides growth and decline data for the following occupational categories: executive, administrative, and managerial; professional specialty; marketing and sales; administrative support; service; and production, craft, and repair. Because the data in Projected Employment  cover a wide range of labor categories, an analysis of occupations related to HCCC programs was conducted and results are tabularized according to at least one of the following criteria: students could obtain employment within the occupation upon graduating from HCCC; or they could obtain employment after further study. The report concludes that food/beverage preparation, primary and secondary education, office administration and support, and information technology provide key avenues of employment for HCCC students in programs related to those areas. Virtually all employment categories require that students possess strong basic skills in the traditional areas of communications and mathematics, as well as in information technology. (VWC)",

The paper considers those discourses that are related to the experience of a part-time ESL writing instructor. It examines discourse on multiple levels. First, the study looked at the institutional discourses circulating at the community college. Next, the study analyzed the discourse in interviews conducted with the instructor and program administrators to show how the level of affiliation with the institution that each informant displayed had material implications for the course. Finally, it identified and compared the cultural models these informants held about ESL students. In the  case of the Basic Writing 3 course, the Open Door Discourse spoke most strongly to the well-educated, middle-class students who had been previously prepared to take advantage of the college's resources. The Sorting Discourse worked with the refugees and immigrants who were without the means to find what they needed in the institution. The level of affiliation to the institution manifested by the instructor and administrators' discourses underscores the importance for instructional staff to be integrated into the social worlds in which they work. Part-time instructors are generally prevented from enjoying such integration, however, thereby affecting the quality of instruction they provide to students. (Contains 16 references.) (VWC)",

Over 60% of completers stated that their goal was to obtain a vocational degree as compared to 40% of leavers, who also stated a higher proportion of less specific goals such as self-enrichment. Completers may be more likely to be focused on obtaining a degree in one specific program. For instance, all the multi-program students were leavers. Leavers stated lack of time, finances, job changes, and  personal matters were the top reasons for not continuing. Most respondents reported high satisfaction with all programs and were interested in taking more classes at Cabrillo. Computer and interpersonal skills were stated as most needed after leaving Cabrillo. Employment did not significantly differ by completion status. Completers in general earned higher incomes than did leavers. Completers are proportionately more likely to be working in their field than leavers, especially for the Dental Hygiene and Nursing Programs. (VWC)",

        "description":"The paper addresses the following controversial issues between colleges and their external stakeholders: defining and measuring student success, developmental education, and accountability. Given a variety of educational goals by individual learners, community colleges need to create a system of multiple measures to define student success. An important new way of measuring student performance is student goal attainment. Furthermore, a redefinition of \"completion\" would permit colleges to track incremental learning or skill acquisition by acknowledging the completion of \"chunks\" or modules within programs. The purpose of developmental education is to provide all students with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of their diverse needs and goals. An expanded yet clearly  defined role for developmental education can help make the promise of open access to higher education a reality and strengthen the U.S. workforce of tomorrow. A simple set of reliable and valid indicators centered around student goal attainment needs to be adopted nationally if community colleges are to respond more meaningfully to increasing public expectations to account for their performance. The AACC (American Association of Community Colleges) Core Indicators (1999) provide a valuable resource and could be adopted as a starting point for building local college accountability plans.

The data listed under the 1999 column and the 1995 column are placed side by side whenever possible. The surveys seek both a quantitative and qualitative reflection of Cabrillo students' attitudes, awareness, satisfactions, and desires. The Office of Institutional Research obtained detailed feedback about program and service satisfactions. Students not only rated their overall level of satisfaction, but also their satisfaction with Quality of Service, Knowledge of Staff, Helpfulness and Attitude of Staff, Wait-Time for Service,  and Location of Student Services. The college used a similar approach to assess students' educational goals and their accomplishments. A total of 930 students participated in this survey. The survey respondents in 1995 and 1999 are very similar in their demographics. This helps with determining the validity of the trends and other findings and conclusions. Also presented are students' written comments to the following open-response questions: classes at Cabrillo, additional student service programs students would like to see, their ideas for attracting and retaining more students, and other courses they would like to take that are not presently offered.

        "description":"In fall and winter 1998, a survey was sent to the 162 full-time faculty at Westchester Community College (New York). The survey, which was designed and processed by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at the University of California in Los Angeles, was also conducted on full-time faculty at public two-year colleges throughout the country during the same period. Eighty faculty members returned the survey in usable form giving a response rate of 49.4%. Results of the survey for the WCC faculty and nationwide are reported under nine headings: (1) background characteristics, (2) professional plans and accomplishments, (3) allocation of time, (4) reasons important in pursuing an academic career, (5) teaching practices and goals for student, (6) opinions about WCC, (7)  opinions about academe in general, (8) job satisfaction, and (9) stress factors on the job. The most noteworthy aspect of this HERI faculty survey is the marked differences in responses between the sexes on many of the questions. These differences may be partially attributable to age, since a disproportionate number of female faculty are under fifty. Substantial differences exist in outlook, teaching methods, and attitudes about WCC and academe in general between the male and female faculty teaching at WCC. (VWC)",

Also examined are projected student enrollment for 1998-2006: projected changes in population and age demographics in Wyoming and projected enrollments in Wyoming Colleges. The study found that 93% of Wyoming College System credit headcount enrollments were Wyoming residents in 1997. From 1990-97 college system credit enrollments declined 4.7%. The proportion of 17-24 year-olds increased substantially systemwide between 1990-1997. This  group is projected to continue growing until the year 2000 and then begin declining (-8% from 2000-2006). The third largest contributor to enrollment in 1997 was the 25-29 year-old group. This group is projected to increase 56% between 1997 and 2006. The document reports findings for each of the seven colleges and primary feeder counties analyses and on regression analysis of college enrollments and unemployment statistics. The inconsistency with which population growth was reflected in the proportion of college system enrollments suggests that factors other than the size of the potential pool of students have substantial impact on enrollments.

        "description":"Drawing on data from the 1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, this analysis sought to differentiate instructional faculty and staff at public two-year colleges by age (under 35 vs. 55-64) and by years of experience in the current job (under 10 years vs. 20 or more years). The report examines differences by primary teaching field, comparing respondents in seven areas: business, law, and communications; health sciences; humanities; natural sciences and engineering; social sciences and education; vocational training; and all other areas. There were two major differences between younger and older instructional faculty and staff: (1) the two groups represent individuals who are at different stages of their careers and (2) their employment histories differed. Some of the  differences between those who have held their current jobs for less than 10 years and those who have held their jobs for 20 or more years mirror the differences between younger and older colleagues. Comparisons by primary teaching field suggest the presence of disciplinary subcultures within the community college professorate. The discipline appears to have a clear relationship with instruction, especially in terms of literacy (as reflected in the assignment of term papers or the use of written examinations) and student involvement in classroom instruction (as reflected in the use of teacher lectures).

Each Area of Inquiry is linked to one or more of the College's Strategic Goals. The key word for each College Goal is identified with one or more Areas of Inquiry  in order to show the relationship of the performance indicators to planning and budgeting.

The report begins with a brief methodological overview followed by a description of the socio-demographics of the sample. A total of 1511 faculty completed the survey, of whom one-quarter worked at two-year colleges, 28 percent worked at private four-year institutions, and 48 percent were in public four-year institutions. The third section examines faculty overall career choices  and attitudes. The discussion continues with a section covering factors that faculty members consider important in their work and career as well as their levels of satisfaction with these factors. In the fifth section, the report examines factors that impinge upon the academic work of faculty. Next, the report presents faculty members' assessments of institutional policies and priorities. The seventh section provides faculty members' opinions on tenure, tuition, and fees.

The workbooks are designed to empower parents by providing appropriate choices individually tailored to their needs by the caseworker. The workbooks may also help caseworkers and mediators design cooperative adoptions with parents. Workbook 1, &quot;A Child's Needs,&quot; addresses the child's needs including where they have been, people that make a difference, what is important to the child, what gives the child  strength, the child's needs, and benefits of cooperative. Workbook 2, &quot;Looking at Options,&quot; looks at options including parenting, adoption, child's needs, involving the family, children with special needs, considering choices, and thinking about loss. Workbook 3, &quot;A Cooperative Adoption,&quot; addresses cooperative adoption including openness, choosing parents, meeting parents, planning the agreement, contact before placement, and the adoption agreement. Workbook 4, &quot;Letting Go,&quot; addresses letting go, including plans and goals, visits, transitions, good-bye ceremonies, grief, loss, healing, and new relationships. The Practice Manual presents a process that works in establishing openness in a wide variety of adoptions. The manual includes suggestions for professionals, ideas for transitions,  and additional questions that might help clients. (Contains 39 references.) (SD)",

        "description":"This report from a 1995 Child Care Action Campaign national audioconference examines approaches to empowering parents through developing support, leadership, advocacy, and activism to better enable low-income parents to become effective change agents. The report describes the experiences of three parent programs, which found that parents typically help their children first, recognize the interests they share with other parents, and then take an increasingly active role in programs, institutions, and public policies that directly influence their lives. The first program described, the Parent Services Project (California), offers low-income parents the opportunity to take responsibility for organizing social and educational activities and managing resources to carry them out. This  program confirms to the child care center staff that parents are assets to their children's development. The second program, Parent Leadership Institute (Connecticut), trains parents to work as community activists and child advocates in school systems and local government. Parents who participated in this 9-month training program have raised funds and organized courses for parents in their children's schools, and have effectively dealt with city government officials to rectify dangerous situations in the school. The third program, Parents United for Child Care (Massachusetts), has organized 1,500 parents to identify, lobby for, and pursue specific improvements in child care funding and programs to meet their family needs. This group has expanded school-age child care, developed and  expanded care and education for preschool children, and increased child care funding for welfare recipients and working poor participants in education and training.

        "description":"State strategies used to build constituencies and expand the resource base of the child care systems they are developing will be an important contribution to the success of welfare reform. This report, from a 1996 Child Care Action Campaign national audioconference, describes the innovative strategies used to strengthen leadership, expand community participation, and increase investments in child care in Colorado and Washington. The report notes that Colorado's efforts involve a high-level business commission and a grass roots movement, each operating independently of the other but in mutually reinforcing ways, and have mobilized new child care advocates whose legislative victories range from an income-tax check-off for investments in child care quality to an expansion of  preschool capacity to restoring the dependent care tax credit to families. The report includes the recommendations of the Colorado Business Commission on Child Care Financing, which had direct impact on the decisions of a committee on welfare reform in the Colorado legislature. Also noted are the efforts of the Colorado Children's Campaign, which developed advocacy training around the children's agenda and personalized the need for better child care through a doll project to build support for child care solutions. The report then describes efforts in Washington, where coordinated priority-setting and budget-negotiating among child care advocates and agency officials are the essence of an effective legislative strategy that has kept child care at the forefront of welfare reform proposals,  increased state-funded subsidies for low-income working families, and increased state funding for child care training and licensing activities. This report includes a description of the Washington State Child Care Coordinating Committee. (KB)",

Employment information was downloaded from the Child Care Management System databases of the Child Care Coordinating Agencies in Duval County, Pinellas County, and the Big Bend area in December 1995. Findings indicated that the working  poor in the sample received federal, local, and state subsidies to help them pay for child care while they work. Most subjects were employed in retail trade, principally fast-food restaurants and grocery stores. After retail trade, employment patterns varied for each study area, with major employment including health services, business services, and public administration.

The seven-month intervention consisted of a cooperative learning curriculum and the adoption of a multiple intelligences approach, emphasizing the development of appropriate social skills and conflict management. Data on student progress were obtained on a pre-post basis by means of student surveys, teacher  observation checklists, and teacher-made tests. The post-intervention data indicated that engaging students in cooperative learning, implementing multiple intelligences, and providing a variety of student activities improved academic achievement and resulted in a decrease of inappropriate behavior.

Forty-five preschool children rank-ordered playmate preferences for male and female story characters who expressed happiness, anger, sadness, fear, and neutrality and indicated how much they liked such characters. The effect of children's family expressive environments on their responses was also assessed. Findings indicated that liking ratings were based solely on the nature of the emotion being expressed, with happy characters being liked the most and angry characters the least. Children did base some of their playmate preference rankings of the characters on gender stereotypes of emotion expression, and family  expressiveness played a role in these preferences, with children from low-expressive homes making gender-stereotypic preferences more than children from high-expressive homes.

The study analyzed the views of six third-grade teachers in six elementary schools in a Southeastern state prior to a proposed implementation of a constructivist curriculum, along with the views of the two teachers who implemented the constructivist science curriculum in their classrooms. Informal interviews prior to implementation indicated that teachers viewed a constructivist approach to teaching as a challenge and a concept that is difficult to grasp in a short period of time. They  considered it an additional burden that they were unable to handle and were concerned about its effect on classroom discipline. The two teachers who did implement the constructivist approach were supportive of the curriculum but were not confident about providing appropriate materials, promoting experimentation, and initiating children's construction of knowledge.

        "description":"Noting that socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural variations among fathers and differences in family structure may affect fathers' roles and their level of involvement with their children, this brief summarizes key research findings on the ways in which various factors influence fathers' involvement in children's lives. Regarding socioeconomic influences, indicators such as education level, income, and social class have been found to be linked to father involvement; for instance, fathers with higher levels of education are more accessible to and engaged with their school-age children. Bleak economic conditions may lead fathers to seek alternative ways to be involved with their children. Regarding racial and ethnic variations, research has revealed variations in the amount and type  of father involvement based on the racial/ethnic background of the father; however, there are perhaps as many or more similarities as there are differences. Regarding family structure, research has not kept pace with changes in family structure and children's living arrangements. Research does indicate that stepfathers vary in how involved they are in their parenting roles; single custodial fathers vary in their parenting role; and fathers who live apart from their children are usually much less involved with their children than fathers who reside with them.

        "description":"As rates of divorce and nonmarital childbearing have increased in recent decades, the percentage of children and fathers who live apart from one another has also increased. Yet our knowledge of how father involvement affects children's well-being in these situations is quite limited, since most research on fathers and children has focused on intact families. This brief summarizes key findings on the relationship between father involvement and child outcomes from that larger body of research, as well as the relatively small group of studies that consider fathers who live apart from their children. Main findings are as follows: (1) children benefit from positive relationships with their fathers; (2) fathers can positively influence their children's development by assuming a  significant amount of the child care tasks; (3) a father's parenting style has implications for child well-being; (4) fathers' involvement can affect children's social development, cognitive development, and academic achievement; (5) limited research has been conducted on the relationship between child outcomes and involvement of fathers who do not live with their children; (6) provision of child support is related to children's cognitive development, academic achievement, and behavior; and (7) research findings on the association between frequency of father-child contact and child outcomes are mixed.

        "description":"Noting that the well-being of children and that of mothers cannot be separated, this report provides information on the well-being of mothers worldwide. The report compares the status of mothers in 20 industrialized nations and in 86 developing countries, and creates a Mothers' Index measuring the overall status of mothers. The Mothers' Index is a composite of elements contributing to a woman's well-being, including health status, modern contraceptive use, literacy, and participation as national government officeholders; and elements contributing to a child's well-being, including infant mortality rate, access to safe water, primary school enrollment, and nutritional status. Data were based on published statistics from governments, international agencies, and research  institutions. The report affirms the strong link between the well-being of mothers and children and identifies two factors that make a vital difference in their well-being: female education and access to--and use of--family planning services. The report also finds that national wealth alone does not guarantee the welfare of mothers and children. Recommendations from the analysis include the following: (1) ensure access to quality education for both women and girls; (2) ensure that all women have access to high quality, voluntary family planning services, in the context of broader maternal and child health services; (3) improve current research and conduct new studies that focus specifically on mothers; and (4) close the gap in mothers' and children's well-being among marginalized  populations in industrialized countries. Appended is each country's score for each component of the Mother's Index, a description of the methodology, and research notes. (KB)",

This study evaluated the effectiveness of two program models in educating parents about available sources of health insurance and in increasing enrollment of uninsured children into Medicaid or Child Health Plus (CHP), New York's insurance program for children of low-income families. One model targeted low-income families applying for or receiving Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutritional services. The second model targeted owners/employees of small businesses selling WIC-approved foods and sought to educate them about the availability of Medicaid and CHP and to conduct enrollment at vendor sites. Pre- and  post-implementation surveys were conducted to assess knowledge about health insurance, Medicaid, and CHP and to determine baseline enrollment rates. Findings indicated that WIC sites were ideal enrollment assistance sites. Awareness grew from 46 to 65 percent at enrollment-assistance sites, whereas comparison sites saw an increase from 52 to only 60 percent. Enrollment in CHP increased from 12 to 16 percent at intervention sites, compared to an increase from 8 to only 10 percent at comparison sites. Medicaid enrollment increased slightly at intervention sites and declined at the comparison sites. Small businesses participating in the WIC program were effective outreach vehicles but not efficient venues for enrollment. Facilitators could enroll approximately 1,000 children yearly at a cost  of $35 per application. It was concluded that new efforts are needed to reach families within their own communities and to facilitate their enrollment in Medicaid and CHP. (KB)",

Adolescents in 7th and 10th grade completed self-report questionnaires assessing 6 features of parent-adolescent relationships: time spent together, number of activities, degree of influence, frequency of experiencing positive emotions, negative emotions, and subjective closeness. Academic performance was assessed with school grades and self-report measures of academic functioning and academic motivation. Findings indicated that seventh-graders had higher academic performance than tenth-graders and had relationships with parents that involved more time, activities, influences, and positive emotions. Parent-adolescent relationship features predicted academic performance in  the tenth-grade sample but not in the seventh-grade sample. The strongest predictors of tenth-graders' academic performance were the degree of influence and the frequency of experiencing negative emotions in relationships with mothers. The findings suggest that multidimensional measures of parent-adolescent relationship features may be useful for improving understanding of parents' role in adolescents' academic performance.

        "description":"This review of the literature regarding the impact of maternal speech on the formation of a child's sense of self compares the speech of well mothers to that of depressed mothers. The review finds that maternal speech has a strong influence on the formation of symbolic self-representations during the toddler period. However, depressed mothers' speech is significantly different from that of normal mothers in terms of both content and process, and these differences have been shown to affect the way that children come to view themselves. Although no study specifically addressed the effect of depressed mothers' speech on the development of presymbolic self-representations, it is highly likely to have some effect via the mother's difficulty in maintaining interactions. Depressed  mothers speak less to their infants, exaggerate their intonations less, and take longer to respond to infants, suggesting that interactions may be awkward at best or nonreinforcing at worst. Depressed mothers' speech to infants also appears to be critical and negative. These structural and content differences in depressed maternal speech carry over to the toddler period. The studies suggest that depressed mothers may be assisting their children in developing symbolic-self-representations that are highly negative in nature. However, the picture is more dynamic and complicated than is presented due to the impact of other individuals in the child's environment. How a father, siblings, peers, teachers, and grandparents respond will affect the process of forming an integrated sense of self. In  addition, qualities within the child, such as temperament, will also affect the process. (Contains 70 references.) (HTH)",

Faculty also reported insufficient language experiences and opportunities to interact socially with others prior to entering kindergarten. A review of solution strategies suggested by  professional sources and educational literature resulted in the selection of 3 interventions over a 4-month period: explicit teaching of social skills, the use of a violence prevention program, and the application of cooperative learning strategies.

        "description":"Controversies continue regarding the effects of corporal punishment on children. Research has demonstrated an association between levels of corporal punishment and negative outcome behaviors such as aggression and other mental health problems. However, most of these studies have been cross-sectional and correlational in design, thereby precluding causal inferences. A more comprehensive understanding of the effects of corporal punishment requires taking into account the context of discipline and parent-child relationships, the influence of child and parent characteristics, as well as the cultural context in which corporal punishment takes place. This review of the literature addresses these issues as well as examining the current state of research, methodology, and issues of  causality, and implications for parent education and future research. The review finds that the risk for negative and harmful consequences increases when corporal punishment is used in the context of a harsh, abusive, or dysfunctional parenting approach, and also when it continues to be the practice in older children and adults. Recent studies have begun to examine more closely the influence of culture on children's perceptions and interpretation of spanking and its subsequent effect on child behavior. Future research should examine the effects of physical punishment on a wide variety of other desirable and undesirable child outcomes. (Contains 48 references.) (Author/HTH)",

The lack of such skills in the prekindergarten through first-grade students was documented by means of teacher observations, summary reports, daily behavior reports, student portfolios, discussions with other teachers, and test scores. Data revealed that the students had problems with poor listening, off-task behavior, high levels of dependency on older peers within the class, disruptive behavior due to high frustration levels, low participation in classroom activities, and inability to make transitions successfully from group to independent activities. An examination of curriculum content and instructional strategies revealed few  opportunities for students to make choices, no integration of the desired social skills in the curriculum, ineffective team-building strategies, and inappropriate implementation of individual monitoring plans. Two interventions were selected: a revised and enhanced approach to implementing the Second Step Program (Committee for Children), and a mandatory staff development workshop that focused on instructional strategies and curriculum enhancements to more effectively develop students' personal and social skills. Post-intervention data indicated an improvement in the students' transfer of social skills in daily real-life situations, an improvement in their approach to resolving conflicts, and an increase in their ability to work cooperatively.

Analysis of probable causes data revealed that students lack interpersonal skills related to: communicating feelings effectively, empathizing with others, working cooperatively with others, and handling conflict with poise. A review of solution strategies combined with an analysis of the  problem setting resulted in a 16-week intervention focusing on five components of emotional intelligence: cooperation, communication, expression of feelings, appreciation of diversity, and conflict resolution. Each topic was covered twice a week over 2 weeks, then revisited for 1 week each. The final week was devoted to conducting final assessments.

During the 16-week intervention, the teachers implemented teaching strategies consistent  with cooperative learning, multiple intelligences, and positive discipline to create a child-centered, motivating, positive, safe, and trusting environment. During the intervention, students participated in pre- and post-intervention interviews, weekly student inventories, and anecdotal record keeping. Data indicated that the program reduced inappropriate behaviors and increased student motivation. Teacher/researchers' time correcting misbehavior was reduced, leaving more time available for academic instruction and resulting in student academic and personal growth. Twenty-two appendices include student interview forms, lesson plans, and instructional materials. (Contains 33 references.) (HTH)",

        "description":"This study examined the association between various shared activities and the quality of parent-child relationships. Participating in the study were 211 undergraduate students attending a small liberal arts college. They completed a questionnaire in which they rated the quality of their relationship with their parents, the amount of contact they had with their parents, and the activities shared with mothers and with fathers when the participants were young children. A summary score for quality of relationship with mother and a separate score for quality of relationship with father were calculated. Median splits were performed on both summary scores, distinguishing between those with high quality relationships and those with low quality relationships with each of their parents.  T-tests were performed to compare these two groups in terms of involvement in 22 shared activities between parents and children, such as driving to lessons, watching sports, putting child to bed, watching television, doing homework, exercising, cooking, vacationing, eating breakfast, eating dinner, participating in holiday events, and gardening. The findings indicated that there were significant differences between the two groups on almost all the scores for shared activities with the mother (except camping) and the father (except going to museums and zoos). The results offer strong support for the idea that shared activities with young children are associated with more positive relationships with parents during late adolescence and early adulthood. The type of shared activity did not  seem to matter. (KB)",

The kit includes speaker notes and accompanying overhead transparencies, a list of publications on family involvement, a video clip from the 1999 broadcast \"Fathers Matter!\" and a discussion guide for viewing the full broadcast. The overhead transparencies cover research on father involvement, public opinion on father involvement, and strategies for fathers to get involved and for schools to encourage such involvement. The videotape presents  excerpts from the \"Fathers Matter!\" broadcast, and includes student thoughts on parent involvement, responses to phone inquiries from the public given by a panel of fathers and others encouraging male participation, a description of the Illinois Fatherhood Initiative, and other strategies for involvement. The materials are useful to preservice/inservice training and professional development coordinators and are meant to generate discussion on father's involvement in children's learning and family involvement in education.

Statistics are presented on the current status of children with regard to child support, school readiness, immunizations, health insurance, poverty level, and other important characteristics. The report notes that although significant progress has been made with regard to health insurance coverage, child poverty rate, teen birth rate, participation in the School Breakfast Program, infant mortality rate, juvenile homicides, and child abuse and  neglect rates, considerable challenges remain. Child advocacy is defined, and the work of the National Association of Child Advocates from its inception is described. A Child Advocacy Timeline from 1847 to the present day includes important milestones in the history of child advocacy efforts in the United States. The report also contains a list of members of the National Association of Child Advocates organized by state, describes the accomplishments of NACA members, and details the support NACA provides to its members. The report delineates the challenges for NACA in the next 15 years and presents a list of supporting organizations. The report concludes with the 1999-2000 annual report from the president of NACA.

        "description":"Noting that there is little focus in research literature, in popular discussions, or in policymaking regarding how to promote positive youth development, this research brief presents a preliminary set of constructs that might comprise positive youth development in order to spark productive conversations that will lead to a better conceptualization and a greater understanding of the full range of development and behavior possible for children. The list of constructs was based on opinions expressed in national surveys, from a perceived cultural consensus about characteristics and activities that are intrinsically valuable, and from research that finds associations between certain child and youth characteristics and later positive outcomes. Each of the following constructs is  reviewed briefly: (1) close parent-child relationships; (2) sibling relationships; (3) peer relationships; (4) character; (5) civility; (6) religiosity/spirituality; (7) tolerance; (8) extracurricular activities; (9) sports and exercise; (10) participation in cultural and literary activities; (11) environmental lifestyle; (12) volunteer community involvement; and (13) social capacity. The brief concludes by noting that there is currently extensive coverage of negative adolescent behaviors and poor child outcomes, and that the scarcity of information on positive development is due, in part, to a lack of consensus among experts in the field regarding positive outcomes desired for children. This lack of consensus undermines the capacity to raise healthy, high-achieving children. (Contains 34  references.) (KB)",

This book details a step-by-step process to help preschool and elementary educators get started in the use of portfolios for student assessment or gain new insights or strategies in their use. Chapter 1 introduces performance assessments and portfolios, and discusses current thinking about their use. Chapter 2 presents the framework for initiating portfolio assessment, including primary decisions that must be made when moving into portfolio assessment. Chapters 3 through 6 are case studies of individual and groups of teachers, and the process they used to begin using portfolio assessment in their individual teaching settings.  Chapter 3 reflects the use of portfolios in a model child development center serving infants through 4-year-olds. Chapter 4 reports the experience of a group of teachers who restructured their school to improve the achievement of children from poor families. Chapter 5 reviews the experiences of teachers in the intermediate grades in implementing portfolio assessment, focusing on mathematics and science assessment. Chapter 6 details a project approach to curriculum development and the curriculum-portfolio connection in an after-school program. Chapter 7 discusses common elements from the four case studies: the decision to use portfolio assessment, philosophical bases for its use, selecting the purpose for portfolios, criteria for selecting assessment strategies, and collecting,  interpreting, and reporting data. Five appendices include assessment forms. (KB)",

The statistical portrait is based on 22 indicators of well-being: (1) births to single teens; (2) children living in poverty; (3) children receiving free school meals; (4) children in families receiving economic assistance; (5) childhood deaths; (6) infant mortality; (7) births that received early prenatal care; (8) immunizations; (9) low birth weight babies; (10) Head Start participation; (11) child care availability; (12) post-secondary education; (13) high school graduates receiving post-secondary education; (14) births to mothers with less than a high school diploma; (15) students graduating high school; (16) foster care; (17) teen violent deaths; (18) reported child abuse and  neglect; (19) substantiated child abuse and neglect; (20) juvenile court filings; (21) youth alcohol use; and (22) youth drug use. Following an overview, the first part of the data book discusses children at risk in Kansas and specific risk factors that measurably limit children's development and narrow their opportunity for succeed in life. The bulk of the data book presents statistics, by county, for each indicator. A state of Kansas profile and county-by-county statistics conclude the data book. Among the findings, infant mortality, Head Start participation, teen violent deaths, out-of-home placements and illicit drug use show improvement; childhood deaths, births that received early prenatal care, and measures of early childhood care and education remain relatively stable; and reports  of child abuse and neglect, alcohol use and juvenile court filings, and binge drinking all show deterioration.

Data were collected during a school year. Each participant was observed 3 times a week for 2 hours per session, totaling approximately 200 hours for the year. Literacy events were defined as any reading or writing activity utilizing literacy artifacts, such as magazines, children's books, mail, paper, and pencils, initiated by anyone in the presence of the participant children. The researcher took notes, audiotaped the talk about significant literacy events, and talked with the mothers about their literacy experiences with their children. Findings indicated that the young  participants initiated the interaction with print most of the time and tried to engage their mothers or siblings in the literacy events. In addition, they explored literacy while they engaged in everyday activities such as watching television, listening to music, singing, and playing. Print was not only mediated by their mothers, siblings, and friends, but also by today's available media, mainly television and music, and also by play. (Author/HTH)",

Participating in the study were 103 students at different points during a 4-year undergraduate program. Their responses to a 4-item open-ended questionnaire indicated that students' definitions illustrated minimal understanding and  conceptualizations of multicultural education limited to issues related to race and ethnicity. A majority of respondents constructed their definitions from college courses, suggesting that universities may have tremendous influences on student attitudes toward diversity. Participants witnessed multicultural education on a limited basis in the school sites and were confronted with incongruencies between the diversity perspective advocated in university course work and in their field experiences.

        "description":"This paper provides an overview of practices in small rural elementary schools in Ireland and recent trends related to school size. There are 3,200 &quot;ordinary&quot; elementary schools in the Republic of Ireland serving children aged 4-12 in eight levels: two preschool levels and grades 1-6. System-wide policies with implications for small schools include staffing policies that can result in 57 students in a one-teacher school, the denominational nature of the system and the hegemony of school management by the Catholic church, high teacher-pupil ratios, and the absence of administrative principals in schools with fewer than eight teachers (about 77 percent of all elementary schools). Over half of all Irish elementary schools have fewer than five teachers, but there is no weighted  funding to compensate for small size. As the school population has declined since the 1960s, policymakers have actively promoted the closing of small schools. A 1991 international evaluation recognized the benefits of small schools but nevertheless encouraged consolidations aimed at four-teacher schools, a recommendation that would result in the closure of 1,357 schools. Subsequent debate highlighted the general lack of policy in relation to small schools and the ways in which current policies disadvantage small schools further and damage their viability. Research and policy needs of small rural schools are discussed. (Contains 20 references.) (SV)",

A short survey was completed by administrators in 128 districts. Preliminary findings from the survey were discussed at four community roundtables attended by 95 representatives of rural school districts and their partners. A nomination form was distributed widely to identify promising practices, and site visits were conducted in four nominated districts. The findings are presented around the following themes: (1) greater emphasis was on STW issues among administrators than among parents, teachers, or the business community; (2) great disparities existed among rural schools in the involvement of teachers and parents in STW activities; (3) the need for  increased involvement of businesses and employers was apparent; (4) most rural schools were only in the planning or early stages of implementation; (5) there was limited information on model programs; (6) problems involving long distances to business sites and lack of student transportation existed; and (7) there were needs for targeted STW funding at the district level and for state support and legislation recognizing the distinct challenges of rural districts. Promising practices are described in each of these areas, and recommendations are listed based on the same themes. Two approaches are outlined for providing technical assistance to rural STW programs. (SV)",

Native educators throughout the state contributed to the development of these guidelines through a series of workshops and meetings associated with the Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative. Throughout this document, Elders are accorded a central role as the primary source of cultural knowledge. Guidelines are listed to  increase the cultural responsiveness of Native Elders, authors and illustrators, curriculum developers and administrators, teachers, editors and publishers, document reviewers, researchers, Native language experts, Native community organizations, and the general public.

        "description":"This paper draws on the Western Australian School Effectiveness Study (WASES) to examine school-level factors associated with improved teacher morale as one measure of effective high schools. The 1997 WASES teacher sample included 212 teachers from 28 rural and urban high schools in Western Australia. Data analysis using the Multilevel Linear Model focused on teacher responses to the School Level Environment Questionnaire (SLEQ), which includes eight subscales measuring relationship, personal, and system aspects of the school environment; measures of general self-concept and academic self-concept (teacher efficacy); and the teacher morale scale of the School Organizational Health Questionnaire. Teacher morale varied both within and between schools. Teacher morale appeared to be a  useful indicator of healthy and effective schools, with a reasonable correlation with SLEQ scales. Differences in teacher morale, both across and within schools, were explained by six SLEQ scales: teacher affiliation, professional interest, mission consensus, empowerment, innovation, and work pressure. Teacher self-concept, both general and academic, had little effect on teacher morale, suggesting that morale was influenced by outside factors. (Contains 58 references and 6 data tables.) (SV)",

Using the profile as a framework, this paper reports on an ethnographic study of an effective teacher in action with Aboriginal students. The study consisted of semi-participative observation of a teacher of grades 6-7 in a Perth (Australia) metropolitan school in which 45 percent of the students were Aboriginal. Data were gathered via observation, conversation, and recorded interviews with the teacher, principal, and students. Elements identified as critical to effective teaching of Aboriginal students were: an understanding of Aboriginal culture and family background; the teacher's capacity to develop relationships based on openness,  flexibility, empathy, and a collegial rather than authoritarian stance; a student-centered, relationship-based pedagogy featuring peer tutoring, small-group work, cooperative learning, and self-responsibility for learning and assessment; and the negotiation of curriculum and other educational processes with students. Behavioral boundaries were set in consultation with students. It is important to Aboriginal students that the behavior, not the student, be rewarded or sanctioned in private. Self-esteem, confidence, and social skills were enhanced in the classroom, although it seemed at times that academic teaching and learning were less intense than expected from a traditional Anglo perspective.

        "description":"The loss of small farms in the South was dramatic from 1987 to 1997, with family farming becoming an increasingly rare phenomenon. Small farms are important to the local economic base. They purchase inputs locally, keep the tax base low, and reduce the need for public services. Diversity among farm managers is increasing in the South, with greater numbers of Hispanic and women farm operators. At the same time, only small increases are occurring in the number of African American farmers. Sustainable agriculture advocates have an interest in maintaining niches for small farms and in bringing young people into farming. They point out that well educated small-farm operators are more environmentally responsible. Policy issues include: a need to level the playing field for small farms  by developing broad-based national agriculture policy, land use concerns, environmental protection and regulation enforcement, and alternative sources of capital and local financial markets. The major issues facing the small farm are economic--cash flow, income, asset development and protection, and return on investment. These issues must be addressed by federal, state, and local policy. Land grant universities need to commit research and educational resources to address the South's small farms issues. (Contains 14 references.) (TD)",

In 1999, over 175 interviews were conducted with past and present welfare recipients to bring their experiences and concerns to the attention of the public and policymakers. Nearly all interviewees were women and were taking part in work activities. In general, welfare recipients did not want to stay on welfare for life, did not want to be stereotyped, agreed with the idea of welfare reform but had concerns with current reform implementation, were concerned about gaps in the infrastructure supporting the transition from welfare to work, needed better information about rules and options, and believed that support was needed for the working poor. The interviews revealed common themes: issues of respect,  difficulties of coping with chronic poverty on a daily basis, child poverty and the impact of welfare reform on children, the lack of real jobs that pay a living wage, problems with transportation and child care, access to health care, access to further education for parents, advice to others dealing with the welfare system, opinions about why welfare reform was enacted, fears about what will happen after the 5-year limit, and concerns related to crime and domestic violence. Sections on each theme include a summary and interview quotes. A final section discusses some positive state policies concerned with transitional services, child health insurance, and higher education for low-income families; makes recommendations related to interview themes; and points out the need for an economic  bill of rights.

        "description":"A study examined how pedagogic work in Queensland (Australia) schools could be reformed to meet the educational needs of low-achieving students from working-class and unemployed Samoan/Pacific Islander communities. Interviews were conducted with 39 primarily Anglo-Australian teachers and 35 Samoan/Pacific Islander parents and community members serving as paraprofessionals at five schools in a low socioeconomic area with many working-class Samoan immigrants. The interviews revealed that Samoan children are likely to enter school having been socialized into the respectful communicative practices of the &quot;fa'aSamoa&quot; (Samoan Way). Samoan culture has distinct social classes, and three language forms and accompanying dispositions are used in different social contexts. A Samoan  individual's importance is in relation to the importance of other people, but Australian schools are operated from a European perspective, which is based on the individual. This sets up a disjuncture between the communicative dispositions of Samoan children and the behaviors expected of students in school. As a result, Samoan students are likely to experience difficulty accessing the knowledge transmitted through schooling. Community members attributed the educational difficulties of Samoan students to the communicative practices of schooling, specifically the form of the teacher-student relationship, rather than to curricular content. Changes that would minimize these difficulties include creation of a supportive preschool structure, relaxation of the pacing and sequencing of  instructional and regulative discourses, and incorporation of community forms of symbolic control into the school environment.

Site visits were conducted at 29 of these schools (22 with improving scores and 7 with declining scores). Schools selected for site visits included elementary, middle, and high schools; were located primarily in rural areas and small towns; and reflected the state's geographic and socioeconomic makeup as well as the three writing-accountable grade levels (4,  8, and 12). Over 100 teachers, 200 randomly selected students, and 50 administrators were interviewed. Qualitative analyses of the site visit reports yielded 36 indicators that discriminated between improving and declining schools. Statistical analysis revealed that consistently improving schools had significantly higher scores on 35 of 36 indicators. The indicators include measures of administrative support, quality of professional development, family and community involvement, and various instructional strategies. Each of the indicators is described, including narrative guidelines for high, medium, and low scores and examples drawn from site visit reports.

Ultimately, schools must elevate the average performance level of students' portfolios to the benchmark of &quot;proficient.&quot; During site visits to 29 schools, 36 indicators were identified that differentiated writing scores and programs in continuously improving and continuously declining schools. The indicators were used to develop a self-study needs assessment instrument called the &quot;School Study of Writing Instruction.&quot; Created as a handbook, the instrument enables a school to compare different role groups' perspectives on its writing portfolio program and to use the findings to set priorities and plan program improvements. This report describes the field test of the  instrument in 11 schools across Kentucky. Most schools were in rural areas or small towns and served a primarily White population; the schools were otherwise diverse in terms of size, grade level, and Title I eligibility. Of the 10 schools completing the study, 9 found it to be a worthwhile experience that produced some successful outcomes. Steering committee members and principals offered helpful suggestions for improving the handbook. A comparison of schools that were or were not assigned facilitators suggests that facilitator services were highly beneficial. Overall, the instrument was found to be valid and replicable. The potential time investment may temper some faculties' motivation to undertake it, but facilitator assistance could ameliorate this factor.

        "description":"Preventing Agricultural Chemical Exposure among North Carolina Farmworkers (PACE) is a project designed to describe farmworker pesticide exposure and to develop an educational intervention to reduce farmworker pesticide exposure. The PACE project used a community participation framework to ensure that the community played a significant role in identifying its own health problems and working toward their resolution. This manual offers a concrete plan for addressing the problem of farmworker pesticide exposure and is intended for use by anyone who wants to develop a community-based approach to offering pesticide safety instruction for migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Chapter 1 explains the importance of working with the community in developing educational programs and the general  model for the pesticide safety program developed by the PACE Project. Chapter 2 focuses on the procedures for planning a successful safety program using a collaborative, participatory approach. Chapter 3 describes the specifics of the safety program in detail, including suggested instructional techniques and program outlines. The program consists of three parts, a direct safety program for farmworkers, an expanded safety program for farmworker representatives as promoters, and a follow-up program for promoters. All programs meet Environmental Protection Agency requirements for training field workers. The appendix contains English and Spanish versions of 10 fact sheets on pesticide exposure, a list of educational materials, promoter follow-up sheets, and forms for recording local resource  information. A comic that presents pesticide safety issues in Spanish is also included. (Contains 30 references.) (TD)",

        "description":"This paper reports on attitudes toward welfare and poverty among male and female students at a university in rural eastern Kentucky. The area has high poverty rates and low educational and employment levels, particularly among women. A 60-statement survey covering a wide range of social issues was completed by 390 undergraduates. About two-thirds of respondents were women, 81 percent were under 25, about half were education majors, and about half came from the university's service region of eastern Kentucky counties. Among seven categories covered by the survey, the greatest gender differences in attitude were found for questions about race; welfare, work, and poverty; and politics. The results demonstrate that students drawn from a region of socioeconomic deprivation had a high  resistance to welfare as a means of supporting poor families. Overall, there was considerable support for the government's efforts to move welfare recipients from welfare to work, but also skepticism about the availability of jobs and the remuneration received. Over half of students believed that the government has a role in alleviating suffering in this region. Women were generally more sympathetic to the plight of the poor than men. Although some females felt strongly that even mothers with small children should work, most respondents were concerned that welfare policies should not have adverse effects on children.

Two projects in Victoria (British Columbia) elementary schools explored ways to promote positive student attitudes toward mathematical tasks and problem solving. During the first several months of school, six first-graders were identified as being reluctant or unwilling to take risks during mathematics instruction. Open-ended tasks with multiple solutions or methods of solution were expected to stimulate curiosity, group discussion, and risk taking. Once or twice a week, several open-ended activities were presented to the six students as a group or in smaller groups. Over time, the teacher noted  positive changes in the classroom behavior of four of the students, who became more willing to ask questions and volunteer answers. In a second project, a self-assessment checklist that included statements about mathematics attitudes was completed by students in grades 6-7 at the beginning and end of the school year. During the year, open-ended tasks were included during mathematics instruction whenever possible. At the end of the year, improvements were noted in students' attitudes toward mathematics and problem solving, and students' comments indicated that they enjoyed solving problems in different ways and having the opportunity to explain their thinking.

        "description":"Approximately 5,000 works by Native artists across North America were examined to identify images that appeared to contain elements of humor. Several distinctive categories of humor in Native art were revealed: (1) whimsy (a sense of sheer fun or spontaneous amusement); (2) satire, ranging from gentle teasing to biting ridicule; (3) themes involving tricksters or fools; and (4) parody, which may be used to expose racial bias or insensitivity. In indigenous Arctic societies, climatic conditions are harsh, and humor makes life more bearable and eventful. Examples are given of whimsical humor in works by Arctic artists. Examples of satirical humor draw on chance connections across languages and cultures, poke fun at anthropologists, and use dark humor to illuminate painful incidents  in Native history. Examples of narrative trickery and foolery include portrayals of Raven in Northwest Coast art and of the endlessly adaptable Coyote in the U.S. Southwest. Parody is used in examples of performance art to deal with cultural and racial stereotypes. Further research may focus on the cultural and social aspects of Native art styles. Humor is an effective means for marginalized groups to educate others, raising awareness of their perspectives on important issues via memorable and persuasive artwork. Art is vital to multicultural education, and humorous art can help students to enjoy and understand cultures different from their own. (Contains 22 references.) (SV)",

A search for examples of fine art masterpieces used in advertising art examined which masterpieces are commonly used in marketing goods and services, how advertising ideas are merged with master artwork, and how effective strategies related to masterpieces can be implemented in teaching. The identified borrowed masterpieces were of interest to a general audience, were accessible in terms of having recognizable content, and were generally portraits or representations of the human figure. The advertised products and services were very diverse. Potential  criticisms of the alteration of masterpieces in advertising and the attention to this practice in the classroom include the notions that masterpieces are diminished by their use in advertising and that students would be taught to disrespect their artistic heritage. On the other hand, viewing familiar art presented in new creative ways may spark new appreciation of their aesthetic power. These masterpieces are part of everyone's heritage and open to reinterpretation, and attention to the advertising practices in the classroom may capture student interest and motivate learning and critical analysis. Eight related educational strategies and class activities are suggested. (SV)",

This paper reviews research on the impact of team-building activities that include demanding physical challenges on the self-concept of physical education students. Team Building through Physical Challenges (TBPC) is a program comprised of a series of 22 Outward Bound-type problem-solving tasks that can be readily incorporated into a physical education setting. For any individual to succeed, the entire group must master each task. Program developers contend that TBPC provides significant physical and social challenges, as well as problem-solving tasks, and therefore should lead to improved self-concepts related to self-worth, athletic competence, social  acceptance, and scholastic competence. Studies of Outward Bound showed improvement in participants' self-concept in domains related to program goals. Studies of team-building activities in elementary and secondary physical education settings found no significant treatment effects. Two recent studies of the TBPC program with middle school students in physical education settings found that participation increased student perceptions of athletic competence and global self-worth, but that effects were significantly greater for males than females. An ongoing research project will assess the effects of TBPC on student self-concept in an all-female physical education class. (Contains 14 references.) (SV)",

The program aims to improve children's thinking processes by accelerating progress towards higher-order thinking skills. CASE focuses on enhancing students' capabilities in understanding scientific concepts, science being an area of the curriculum that has always presented particular difficulties for the majority of pupils. Rather than being intended as an alternative science curriculum, CASE is designed to be an intervention program within the existing curriculum. It originally targeted students between 11- and 14-years-old.

Those experiments are, as well, the basis of research done for a master's degree course and for a doctorate, in the field of Technological Innovation and Industrial Organization of the Production Engineering Program of the Engineering Programs Coordination (COPPE) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), under the orientation of Professor Ricardo Naveiro. The experiments were structured  beginning with, among other factors, the verification of the students demotivation for the study of such disciplines, linked to great difficulty in the learning process of the same. One reason for this situation is the students' difficulties in concretely understanding the practical application of those disciplines. The obtained results have demonstrated a radical change in the students' view of basic disciplines of graphic representation and have beneficially influenced the motivation for the study of those disciplines. Besides that, the student begins to have a realistic perception of the chosen habilitation right in the initial terms of the course, which would only happen before with the &quot;engineering applied disciplines&quot; or the so-called &quot;professionalizing cycle&quot; which are ministered  in the second half of the course.

        "description":"A prototype system based on an inverted pendulum is used to study the Quality of Service and discuss requirements of remote-experimentation systems utilized for carrying out control engineering experiments over the Internet. This class of applications involves the transmission over the network of a variety of data types with their own peculiar Quality of Service requirement. These data types include video and audio images from the process environment, signal traces related to the acquired measurements, control instructions sent to the process actuators, and other information concerning the states of the process. The set up includes a physical system (an inverted pendulum) as well as a local server fitted with a video camera, data acquisition boards, and network connectivity that  permits interactions with remotely located clients. This paper discusses relevant issues of the design and presents a paradigm for operation based on a client-server configuration and a standard/master-client mode of service. The information streams involved in the process are classified in four groups of different transmission priorities, namely, a parameter stream, a data stream, an administrative stream, and an audio/video stream. This paper analyzes the performance and requirements of the system based on the results of transatlantic tests. The results of the analysis show that real-time remote-control experimentation over the Internet is in fact a new kind of network application featuring its own requirements that are different from those of related technologies used for video  conferencing/broadcasting. In order to overcome the current lack of predictability of the Internet, the final section of the paper suggests improvements such as adapting the priority of the different streams to the Internet bandwidth and to the user's needs.

        "author":["Marsh, Rodney"],
        "description":"Students enrolled to degree programs in 1997 will become the first graduates of the 21st century. Engineering courses in the School of Engineering at Leeds Metropolitan University have changed immensely in the last two years, so as to support new markets. Disciplines such as industrial engineering, electronics and computing have enjoyed their birth, growth, and maturity during the past thirty years. The more recent past has seen a move to include multi-media technology as a generic skill. The final years of the 20th century see engineering students who are less interested in theoretical principles, mathematical concepts and research-focused courses. Furthermore, employers, government and planners of the shape of the engineering profession are seeking different attributes from  engineering graduates which will greatly influence the programs of the next century. The graduate of the future is expected to exhibit a totally different range of skills from their forebears. The workplace for engineers often considers communication skills to be more important than high level mathematics, group working skills more important than academic individuality, and a commitment to lifelong learning and continuing professional development, in most cases, offers more to employers than a theoretical contribution to research focused projects and developments. Students have become more thoughtful and focused about their career aspirations. They demand more opportunity to influence their educational development than has ever been the case. The introduction of tuition fee contributions  in the UK, from 1998, will create greater demands and expectations from the student population. Traditional engineering programs contain significant elements of the curriculum which the graduate engineer will never use. Mathematical excellence seems an obsession of engineering programs, yet experience of the author shows that most engineers are employed in roles which demand a much less demanding level of mathematical ability. The comments mentioned above interact in a curriculum sense to produce contradictions in programs; the solution represents the ingredients for many of the programs of the future. The engineer of the next century must exhibit a range of skills and experiences which differ immensely from those of only twenty years ago. Program delivery modes, experiential  contribution, and learning outcomes must, more than ever, be central considerations of courses. Applications of technology are crucial aspects which have greatly influenced program design at Leeds Metropolitan University. Redesign of the portfolio of programs in the School of Engineering has been very conscious of student aspiration and employer demands. Developing group and team working abilities, project management, and other generic skills for employability are a central focus of our programs. This is coupled with the development of a flexible learning environment where attention to pedagogic integrity is being inculcated in staff development programs. Faculty are being driven down the road of facilitating learning in an environment where direct contact time with students has reduced  and is expected to reduce further. Students are being trained/developed more rapidly to be independent learners and academic emphasis is interwoven with peer assessment, integrative development, measurement of learning outcomes, goal setting, flexible learning, and employment skills. This paper charts the experiences of the School over the past 24 months in restructuring to meet these demands. (Author)",

This paper describes an investigation meant to assess the influence of a person's understanding of the nature of science on his or her decision-making regarding science- and technology-based issues, and to delineate the factors and reasoning people use when making these types of decisions. The decision-making processes of a group of college professors and a group of research scientists who held disparate understandings of the nature of science were examined. Results indicate that there were few differences in the factors influencing the two groups' decisions on complex, controversial science- and technology-based issues, and factors associated  with the nature of science played an insignificant role for a minority of the respondents and no clear role for the majority.

The informants in this study were four high school chemistry teachers with comparable academic and professional backgrounds. These teachers received training on the use of software applications and the underlying scientific concepts, expressed commitment to using the software with their classes, and taught students at the same academic level. All of the participants used the software to teach concepts related to atomic and molecular structure. Their instructional approaches ranged from superficial fact-based activities to in-depth student investigations and presentations. Evidence  suggests that the teachers' beliefs and personal goals shaped their decisions on how to use the software. Beliefs related to the teachers' views about how students learn and their own roles as teachers had the greatest influence on pedagogical decisions. This paper describes the instructional strategies and the implied and stated rationales of participating teachers, and develops a theory of a relationship between teachers' beliefs and practices when implementing interactive computer models.

It provides an opportunity for students to experience teaching early in their teacher education program. The course consists of a field-based and a campus-based component. The field-based component consists of 10 observations of a local teacher's classroom over the course of a semester with the student assisting and participating as a teacher. The campus-based component addresses the theoretical aspects of learning to teach. Historically, the practical field-based component was dissociated from the theoretical campus-based component. The practical lessons encountered in the privacy of local classrooms were difficult to incorporate into the public space of the  campus-based discussion. The practical quality of the field experience juxtaposed against the theoretical quality of the campus discussion resulted in poor student evaluations, indicating that the theoretical discussion lacked relevance.

Additionally, in order to serve new teachers, the mentors must be released from their classroom duties through the use of substitute or full-time replacements. To protect the investment of district funds and mentor time, mentor preparation programs must be able to develop effective mentors. The ultimate benefit of mentor effectiveness is increased effectiveness of beginning teachers, which has long-term payoffs for districts and their students. While much attention focuses on the retention of teachers as a measure of induction success, mentor teachers and their abilities have received little recognition. There appears to be no  research that studies the impact of mentor preparation programs on specific mentoring abilities. Those developing mentor preparation programs in addition to those districts utilizing them have a need for additional measures of program effectiveness.

As a psychological construct, it refers to the interaction between the knowledge and skills of teacher and student. A computer, textbook, or laboratory materials may serve as proxy for a \"teacher.\" Considering that scaffolding is typically a dynamic process, reflecting adjustments based on student responses, arguably the most important source of scaffolding in a classroom, is the flesh and blood teacher. The teacher decides, consciously or unconsciously, how and when to use a computer, textbook, or laboratory materials. The actions of the teacher are also the primary mediator of the scaffolding effects of  other classroom materials. This paper is part of a research program whose purpose it is to design instruction for scaffolding classroom inquiry in middle school classrooms. (Contains 10 references.) (Author/YDS)",

During class discussions and in written assignments, pre-service teachers often talk about meeting the needs of all students. This dedication to teaching to all students appears to falter when confronted with activities that push the pre-service teachers to take ownership of situations and propose alternative actions, or when they are faced with teaching in diverse classrooms.

The underlying philosophy of this approach is its uniqueness within the constructivist paradigm and its potential as an exemplary early childhood program that can be adapted to teach young children science. The educators and parents at Reggio, through a strong commitment and cooperation, have developed an excellent program over the years that has been exemplary not only for educators in Italy and Europe, but has also made a tremendous impact on early childhood education in the United States. The Reggio school uses an integrated curriculum that combines cognitive/symbolic processes in learning. (YDS)",

        "description":"Four years ago, the authors started to develop a self-paced mathematics learning software called NPMaths by using an authoring package called Tencore. However, NPMaths had some weak points. A development team was hence formed to develop similar software called Mathematics On Line. This time the team used another development language called Scientific Notebook. In early 1998, the authors developed some question items using Maple as it includes the strong points of both Tencore and Scientific Notebook. Unfortunately, all the software mentioned above requires the downloading of the package into the local machine. All these packages (Tencore, Scientific Notebook, and Maple) do not have a convenient plug-in version suitable for Web browser application. The team recently developed  similar software using Java. The first batch of question items using Java were used by more than 1,000 students. The Java development was not too successful because the downloading time was too slow, especially when many students are using the package at the same time. Currently the team is studying the possibility of using ActiveX to develop a learning package in which the downloading time is expected to be one-tenth of the Java downloading time. (Author)",

For each question, major findings are summarized, exemplars of studies that have addressed the question are provided, and the contribution of these studies to our understanding of teachers' mathematical knowledge is critiqued. The paper concludes that there is no clearly  definable body of knowledge that informs teaching; rather, teachers need multiple types of knowledge, each of which is somewhat ill-defined and amorphous.

        "author":["Jacobson, Katrine Gram"],
        "description":"High school mathematics (beginning with algebra) is widely regarded as the \"gatekeeper\" to college. It is also the subject students in U.S. public schools fail most often. As the standards movement gains momentum, students who are members of subordinated populations continue to perform worse on standardized measures of mathematical skill than do their mainstream peers. Fundamentally linked to these problems is the nature of mathematics education and the popular notion of \"mathematics\" as a discipline. Mathematics education research has never viewed equity as a central concern, the \"objective\" nature of mathematics in general has never called for examination of the complex political, economic, and ideological forces that shape the terrain of mathematics education in public  schools. This study uses a variety of statistical and ethnographic techniques to illustrate ways in which traditional high school mathematics education supports hegemony and maintenance of the status quo. The study uses multiple regressions, analysis of variance, and path analysis to investigate students' attitudes toward mathematics and to explore factors contributing to success in mathematics. The more math students take, the more they resist the subject and the less it appears useful in everyday life. The study relies upon a critical awareness of the social contexts of both mathematics and mathematics education research to contrast \"radical\" mathematics education with \"traditional\" mathematics education. Focus group interviews with students, interviews with teachers, and transcript  analysis suggest that teacher expectations of student ability have a strong effect on students' mathematical confidence. Confidence, in turn, is a key determinant of students' success or failure in school mathematics. Teachers tend to equate mathematics \"ability\" with the display of appropriate behaviors. Tracking students into college-prep and non-college-prep courses of study continues to fundamentally limit student opportunity. Finally, a case study illustrates the challenges of implementing policy measures grounded in a critical mathematics education paradigm. Math teachers must always consider the larger societal context in which they practice mathematics education if they are to understand the problematic role that subject plays in the education of students, especially those who are  members of subordinated groups.

        "description":"This study's purpose was to present a detailed description and an interpretation of what happens to first year new teachers who are prepared to make connections between science and mathematics and to teach in a manner consistent with the recommendations in the national science education reform movement. The focus was on two sets of participants: (1) all new graduates (N=57) from the Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation [MCTP], a statewide reform-based undergraduate teacher preparation program supported by National Science Foundation funding, and (2) a select sample of first year new graduates of the program in the workplace (elementary and middle level schools) (N=5). Survey and case study methodologies were used. Survey results were reported in comparison to a national  sample. Also reported were differing social strategies enacted by the five new teacher case study participants in response to perceived constraints in the workplace. Research suggests that a reform-oriented mathematics and science teacher preparation program can recruit, educate, and graduate a cadre of new teachers who are employed by school districts. The new teachers from such a teacher preparation program have the capabilities and intentions to teach mathematics and science in a reform-based manner that makes connections between the disciplines by using high quality science mathematics. However, the new teachers' school cultures were a major factor in whether reform-aligned mathematics and science teaching was implemented regularly by the new teachers and if the new teachers continued  to teach in those schools.

The focus was on a select sample of graduates from the Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation [MCTP], a statewide reform-based undergraduate teacher preparation program supported by National Science Foundation funding. A case study methodology was used (first year, N=5; second year, N=3). Differential experiences and perceptions of and by new specialist teachers of mathematics were documented. Analysis was based on a teacher socialization framework as suggested by S. Veenman. Discussion centered on the enculturation of the teachers into an extant teaching culture (school  district and school). Insights were framed in two components: (1) the individual's intentions, needs, and capabilities; and (2) the institutional demands, supports and constraints. A major finding was that the new teachers' school cultures were a major factor in whether reform-aligned mathematics and science teaching was regularly implemented by the new teachers. In addition, the new teachers' perceptions of their school cultures' lack of support of their intent to implement reform-based practices prompted differing social strategies by the new teachers (resistance, moving on, and exit). If these findings are supported by future research, then in order to enact reform and to retain new reform-prepared teachers in schools, more attention needs to be placed on how to foster supportive,  reform-oriented school cultures.

The lesson can be used in units on western expansion, late 19th-century commerce, and urban history.

The examples contained in the handbook were created to provide a vision of how teachers can deliver instruction in ways that help students reach high academic standards in history, develop effective work habits, and gain career knowledge. Standards in the handbook reflect a &quot;thinking&quot; curriculum that requires students to know basic skills, to communicate effectively to solve problems, and to understand and apply academic principles and tools. They define a set of skills and knowledge that will prepare Colorado  students for employment, citizenship, and life-long learning in the new century. The handbook presents explanatory material such as an introduction; a list of workplace competencies divided into communication skills, organizational skills, thinking skills, worker qualities, and technology skills; and &quot;Opportunities for Success&quot; that offers guidelines for educators to help special student populations to meet academic content standards. The history handbook is divided into three broad sections: (1) Grades K-4; (2) Grades 5-8; and (3) Grades 9-12. Each of the six standards in each of the three sections lists an Integration Matrix and a Classroom Activity. A Sample Rubric (an assessment rubric) follows the three sections. A list of school-to-career regional resource centers concludes the  handbook. (BT)",

The 1997 data indicate that the number of high school students involved in service-related programs has increased 686%; and the number of high school students involved in service-learning has increased 3,663%. Using data from studies of school-based and college and university-based service-learning programs, the report estimates the  number of individuals participating in service-learning programs across the country.

        "author":["Ahmed, Zebun N."],
        "description":"A study explored how rural women in the village of Srefultoli, Bangladesh describe, from their own point of view, their experiences with nonformal education (NFE). Feminist research has shown that existing NFE programs in developing countries give women traditional knowledge of family planning, nutrition, and health care, but they do not deal with the need to increase women's awareness of their oppression and exploitation. The study examined whether current NFE programs in this village in Bangladesh give women new knowledge about their current situation in society and in the family and whether these women are conscious of their strategic and practical needs. A social mapping methodology was used to pattern these women's perspectives, and the map serves as a conventional symbol  for the &quot;way things are,&quot; or perceptions of truth. Findings suggest that rural Bangladeshi women are aware of their socio-economic and political subordination and that they use multiple strategies to resist patriarchal domination. Most of the women see participation in NFE programs as an empowering process. Findings also suggest that rural women wanted NFE programs to provide increased opportunities for income generation, for better access to education, for training to help them become economically independent, and for the conscientization of men, so these other objectives may flourish. These women also had specific suggestions regarding the class time, course design, and courses for men that would enhance female participation and would introduce some changes in men's and women's  relationships. Conclusions were that certain more participatory NFE programs may bring meaningful changes in women's lives, and that rural women themselves can best identify their own needs.

        "description":"This lesson, based on National Register of Historic Places files, describes early settlers' lives on some of the approximately 5,000 islands off the coast of Maine. During the mid-18th century many of these islands began to be inhabited by settlers eager to take advantage of this interface between land and sea. The lesson discusses the Blue Duck Ships' Store and the Islesford Historical Museum, both located on Little Cranberry Island, two-and-one-half miles by boat from Mount Desert Island, and both part of Acadia National Park. The lesson could be used in units on the settlement of northern New England or on life in the early national period. It can help students strengthen their skills of observation, research, and analysis of a variety of sources. The lesson provides  background information about the site and lists objectives for students and materials needed. The unit is divided into these sections: &quot;Locating the Site: Maps&quot; (Maine; Mount Desert and neighboring islands); &quot;Determining the Facts: Readings&quot; (The Hadlocks, a Seafaring Family of Maine; Samuel Hadlock VI's Ledger [with transcript]; Edwin Hadlock's Journal [with transcript]; The Gilleys of Baker Island; The Lighthouse Letter); &quot;Visual Evidence: Images&quot; (Little Cranberry Island, 1870; Little Cranberry Island, 1880s); &quot;Putting It All Together: Activities&quot; (Living on an Island; Local History); and &quot;Supplementary Resources.&quot; (BT)",

        "author":["Wentland, Daniel"],
        "description":"Many students perceive economics as a challenging subject, and therefore successfully communicating economics education to students becomes a major concern. This paper uses the work of Sweeney, Becker, and Watts (1996) on undergraduate teaching methods and documents various teaching methodologies utilized in economic education to develop a framework for classifying those methodologies. The framework consists of the three elements of economic education: (1) economic choices; (2) economic concepts; and (3) economic goals. The paper includes Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, teacher or student oriented learning activities, technology based learning activities, and individual or group based learning activity. This framework helps to move the literature forward by fostering  a better understanding of how the teaching methodologies fit into the scope of economic education and, more importantly, how each of these teaching practices influences the learning environment. The paper calls for additional research to include the continual documenting of the various teaching methodologies utilized in economic education as well as creating alternative or additional classification categories. In addition, a quantitative assessment should be developed that could evaluate how well a teaching methodology influenced the learning process and the outcome achieved by the students.

        "description":"The March 2000 WEEA Digest contains two articles. The first, \"Honoring Ways of Knowing\" (A. Lin Goodwin) mentions that notions of \"educational excellence\" or \"education for all\" are too seldom actualized because such conversations often sidestep the reality of inequitable educational practices. Voluminous data exist that articulate how schools help to structure inequality. This digest begins with a brief summary of school experiences of children of color and girls in an effort to make known the ways that schools structure inequality and educators' (and society's) unrelenting low and limiting expectations for these students. The article discusses how authentic assessment can precipitate a shift away from knowledge as discrete and intelligence as static, and foster teachers' deeper  understanding of children of color and girls' abilities, gifts, and ways of knowing. It argues that authentic assessment can result in transformative teaching that honors children's diversities and multiple ways of knowing and learning to nurture \"all\" their talents. The digest includes lists of WEEA resources on assessment; additional resources; and resource organizations for assessment. The second article entitled \"Academic Accountability for Students with Disabilities and LEP\" (Tim Boals) reports on how Wisconsin has developed an alternative assessment framework for special students.

Research indicates that music plays an important role in the brain development of a child. Furthermore, researchers believe that children who have more exposure to music and music training benefit from enhanced brain activity which has been shown to increase students' abilities to perform certain academic tasks. In addition, many practical life skills are acquired through music learning and music training. Music education is believed to deserve the status as an equally significant core subject. A review of the literature demonstrates the benefits of music education, discussing the influence of music on the child's brain development, academic performance, and practical life skills.

        "description":"This paper responds to Martin Jay's imaginative proposal to &quot;map...scopic regimes, or visual cultures.&quot; The intent in the paper was to demonstrate how such a reflexive &quot;social cartography,&quot; or heuristic device might serve to identify and visualize difference within and between disputatious intellectual communities in a way that would open space for all knowledge perspectives discovered and promote a useful visual and verbal dialogue. In pursuit of some provisional answers, 28 illustrative examples of visual culture in comparative education discourse since the early 1960s were chosen, and from visual analysis of these sources, four scopic regimes, or visual subcultures, are identified in the paper. The paper is organized into three sections: (1) &quot;Visual Representations in  Modernity&quot; illustrates how the three scopic regimes of modernity [the technical rationalist (TR), the critical rationalist (CR), and the hermeneutical constructivist (HC)] have their own favored rhetoric and forms of expression, as well as utilities and limitations; (2) &quot;The Invention of a Social Cartography?&quot; presents a personal narrative of how the social cartography project at the University of Pittsburgh has sought to elaborate and implement a new social mapping rationale and methodology; and (3) &quot;The Emergence of Social Cartography&quot; notes some possible implications of the deconstructive perspectivist regime (DP) for current theoretical debates, representational practice, and new opportunities to reposition the field vis-a-vis the human science in the coming millennium. According to  the paper, the goal is to suggest something of the utility of heuristic social maps as new ways to both situate and open representational practice. (Contains 58 notes and 29 figures.)

        "description":"The changing demographics in U.S. institutions have contributed to the increasingly multicultural nature of classrooms. Thus, it is imperative that teachers become cultural brokers and social engineers who have the ability to lead and empower their students. The multicultural construct is seen as a conducive rationale to prepare teachers for the diverse democratic classroom. This paper explores these issues as they pertain to the structure of curriculum and instruction in K-12 social studies classrooms. The paper outlines an alternative approach based on democratic principles and values. It provides pedagogical implications for preservice and inservice teachers to enhance their effective professional teaching roles in helping all learners to succeed. The paper lists nine  guidelines that should underlie the structure of social studies curriculum and instruction, and based on those guidelines, it lists a second set of nine specific guidelines that can best govern the structure of social studies to ensure student success.

The guide declares that academic standards specify what students should know and be able to do; what students might be asked to do to give evidence of standards; how well students must perform; and that content, performance, and proficiency standards are included. The guide also states that standards are benchmarked to the end of grades 4, 8, and 12. The guide notes that students learn to approach art and design from a variety of disciplines because art and design include not only the traditional fine arts but also design arts, media arts, visual learning skills, and the understanding of art and society. It points out that the arts are a result of the unique ability of the  modern human mind to make connections among the basic skills in social relations, natural science, technology, and language, and that students learn to integrate knowledge and processes from many subjects to create and understand this more advanced form of human activity known as art. Following the general information part of the guide, the volume is divided into the following sections: Knowing (A. Visual Memory and Knowledge; B. Art and Design History, Citizenship, and Environment); Doing (C. Visual Design and Production; D. Practical Applications); Communicating (E. Visual Communication and Expression; F.

        "description":"External influences in the universal culture have significantly affected the image of Arab Americans and their children. Although Arab Americans are less visible than other minorities, the anti-Arab perception in the media makes them more visible in a negative way. Based on an ethnographic study investigating the experiences of Arabic-speaking students in U.S. schools, the findings and implications for teaching are presented in this paper. The paper outlines the ways that social conditioning has shaped the evolution of scapegoating, stereotyping and prejudice and how it has affected intercultural relations in U.S. public schools. It examines causes and effects of the \"identity crisis\" in terms of the negative impact cultural conditioning has on the self-image of the  Arabic-speaking child. Finally, the paper focuses on fostering a more positive learning/teaching environment in culturally diverse classrooms, presenting implications for social studies teachers on how to invite mutual trust, develop empathy, reduce prejudice, and empower Arab minority children through the social harmonizing process. It attempts to provide a microsociological account of some important cultural information about Arabic speakers that, hopefully, will assist teachers with a point of departure from which to understand their students and their families.

The visible curriculum and the hidden curriculum are rendered as inseparable. This paper discusses curriculum research in the United Kingdom, adopting the framework sketched above. The paper pays attention to the pre-figurative relationship that exists between curriculum and social structure. It assumes that courses of schooling foreshadow specific forms of social order, and, in turn, it recognizes that curriculum change has a functional relationship to changes in the social order. It also recognizes, however, that this functional relationship is problematic: curricula, like schooling, may work to maintain the social order, or  they may operate to change the social order. But, the paper asks, &quot;What is the social order and how does it operate at local, regional, national, European and global levels?&quot; To explore these questions, the paper focuses on four areas of curriculum and practice: (1) the association of curriculum with social order; (2) the growth of curriculum federalism in the United Kingdom under the shadow of the fragile hegemony of the super-national state; (3) the advancement of new pedagogic identities as a means of injecting social justice into curriculum practice; and (4) the centralist promulgation of a school effectiveness ideology/discourse as a technology of professional and pedagogic differentiation.

        "description":"The present era is one of accountability, high-stakes standardized testing, and standards-based reform. However, there is a relative absence of meaningful discussion of how to achieve equitable outcomes that do not unfairly penalize the most under-served students. This paper challenges the perpetuation of reform practices that do not measure their effectiveness on equitable student outcomes. The paper proposes a paradigm shift that embraces the need to change cultures and to challenge assumptions and belief systems that block or abort efforts of meaningful reform; a paradigm shift whereby schools are held accountable for how well they educate &quot;all&quot; students in an equitable fashion. Schools and communities must engage in inquiries that reveal institutional practices that  contribute to low performance and they must gather data to measure &quot;distribution of learning opportunities.&quot; The paper contends that they must then have the will and be bold enough to take the steps and risks to make the necessary fundamental changes in schools and districts. Educators must embrace data as part of their reform strategy, questions must be posed, and data must be gathered and analyzed to assess how well schools and districts confront and address equity issues. The paper discusses the notion of whole school inquiry as a part of school reform, and describes an example of the researcher's personal experiences in facilitating school and district inquiries that are focused on equitable student outcomes and some &quot;lessons learned.&quot; (Contains 19 references.)

        "author":["Ramey, Madelaine"],
        "description":"It is well documented that there continues to be a gap between white and nonwhite student achievement. A study develops and tests a measure of white-nonwhite achievement gap reduction. The ultimate purpose is to use the measure as the dependent variable in a qualitative study of what works in reducing the gap. The strategy used in addressing this purpose is to propose a measure of gap reduction, examine its properties, use it to identify classrooms that appear successful in reducing the gap, and to study these classrooms in an attempt to identify key characteristics. Data were supplied by the Seattle School District (Washington); their 1999-2000 enrollment was approximately 47,000 students, of which 23% identified themselves as black. The study focused on students who were in the  fourth grade in 1998-1999. The measure of gap reduction appears adequate to the task of identifying classrooms that narrow the test score gap between children of color and white children. That part of the variance in the measure that is attributable to classrooms is considerable. Gap reduction depends mostly on classroom factors, as distinct from characteristics of the student. Moreover, the composite classroom gap reduction index correlates highly with a measure of overall classroom achievement growth. Correlation size suggests that success in reducing the gap tends to occur with success in increasing achievement overall, but the two do not always coincide. This has implications for the continuation of the study, which will use a control group of classrooms with high overall achievement  gains and not so high gap reduction indices. The plan is to add student mobility rate to the set of classroom context variables as soon as it is available. Stability of the gap reduction measure over time needs to be determined.

        "description":"This paper defines a number of different segments in educational change processes: the internal, the external, and the personal. As a form of introduction, the paper reviews the patterns of educational coalition in the second half of the 20th century. For conceptualizing curriculum change in the 1970s, a model is developed that scrutinized the &quot;internal affairs&quot; of change and set this against the &quot;external relations&quot; of change. For instance, in looking at the subject-centered curriculum in secondary schools, the paper argues that school subjects passed through four stages as new changes were initiated: (1) invention or change formulation; (2) promotion or change implementation; (3) legislation or change policy establishment; and (4) mythologization or permanent change. Until the  1970s, change theory focused mostly upon the internally generated changes formulated and promoted by educator groups. Given the changing patterns of globalization and control that have intensified since 1989, the paper revisits this assumption and analyzes what patterns of educational change now prevail. And given the &quot;changing conditions of change,&quot; a reformulated change model emerges in the paper in the following tentative form: change formulation; change promotion; change legislation; and change establishment. The paper contends that change models are required that systematically seek to integrate internal, external, and personal sectors in new &quot;chains of change.&quot; It then tentatively defines such a model of change.

        "description":"This paper explores the potential of incorporating elements of popular culture such as music, film, and court trials as a bridge to help students traditionally alienated by the canonical texts they confront in the &quot;standard&quot; curriculum to conquer and gain a critical understanding of those texts. Sometimes complex, canonical texts can be intimidating and alienating to certain students, especially those with limited exposure to these texts. Those same students exhibit the critical and analytical skills that would serve them well in-class around elements of popular culture. Several units were designed for an urban high school population that combined a major film or genre of popular music with a canonical text of similar themes. The first unit analyzed for the project begins with&quot;The Godfather Trilogy&quot; and incorporates Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;, while the second unit joins Richard Wright's &quot;Native Son&quot; with the film &quot;A Time To Kill.&quot; The paper hopes to call attention to the need for more teacher-conducted classroom research and also to encourage creative approaches to instruction that emanate from the worlds and perceptions of the students and are based on a sound theoretical framework.

        "description":"This paper examines the standards and principles recently proposed for teaching both history and archeology. By comparing the goals each discipline has set for good teaching, areas of difference and commonality can be discerned and questions concerning historical thinking and what may be called &quot;archeological&quot; thinking can then be formulated, thus leading to greater understanding not only of subject disciplines, but also of the cognitive functions students must practice to solve problems about the relationship of past and present. Curriculum standards for history and principles for curriculum reform for archeology recently have been promulgated to give greater focus to teaching in these disciplines; both sets of guidelines recommend training in basic research skills (analysis,  evaluation, presentation of data), and neither set implies any discrete topics that must be taught. The curriculum standards for history in K-12 as proposed by the National Center for History in the Schools (1996) are focused on important skills for finding meaning in historical materials. These standards are presented as &quot;historical thinking&quot;; that is, the ability to put past events into context and engage in inquiry with the evidence. Guiding principles for the archeology curriculum at the undergraduate level recently have been proposed by the Society for American Archeology. However, no guidelines have been provided for teaching about archeology in K-12 schools. (Contains 2 tables [the guidelines] and 13 references.) (BT)",

        "description":"Although it is not yet common practice, case studies are beginning to be used in undergraduate music methods classes. One fruitful approach is the use of case studies as a means of nurturing reflective practice through cooperative learning activities. This paper describes and presents support for the case method of instruction through a review of the music education and educational research and scholarship relating to the case method in teacher education. The paper points out that several music educators have developed casebooks for use in music education methods courses and that several educational researchers have designed research studies to examine and document the outcomes of the case method. It also notes that for music education researchers to engage in case development  research projects, these projects will need to be recognized as scholarly contributions, particularly regarding tenure and promotion. The paper suggests that formation of a &quot;Case Method in Music Education&quot; Special Research Group as a branch of the Society for Research in Music Education may provide a forum for discussion of the case method in music, the development of music education case literature, and the dissemination of research results regarding the case method. It cites several centers for case method research and development in teacher education. The paper suggests that case study research which looks in depth at one music class setting or one music teacher may add to the knowledge base for successful music teaching; research is also needed in the area of implementation and effect  of the use of the case method in music education methods courses.

        "description":"In both Japan and the United States textbooks are regarded as one of the primary tools for classroom instruction. The curricula for elementary and secondary education is the responsibility of each of the 50 states in the United States. In Japan, the Ministry of Education determines the course of study, and curriculum for elementary and secondary schools is based on the regulations of the School Education Law. A study investigated and compared the treatment of contemporary Japan with a special focus on politics after World War II in world history textbooks widely used in Japan and the United States. Five best-selling world history textbooks in Japan were selected for examination, as were five U.S. textbooks currently approved for use in Georgia schools. Differences were found  between Japanese and U.S. senior high world history textbooks including the length of references to post-war Japan and the total number of nouns and proper nouns from the two categories, &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Years.&quot; Differences occurred also in the length of passages and content. For example, Japanese textbooks stressed Japan's foreign relations with the United States and China after World War II and anti-nuclear weapons movements, while U.S. textbooks devoted more space to the U.S. role and policies in Japan during U.S. occupation from 1945 to 1951. References to contemporary Japan in Japanese textbooks were much briefer than in U.S. textbooks. Findings gave rise to five general recommendations, four recommendations for Japanese textbooks, and four recommendations for U.S. textbooks. (Contains  6 tables and 65 references.) (BT)",

        "author":["Johnson, Andy"],
        "description":"Successful course reforms rely on the development of courses that support productive patterns of classroom interaction. Particularly in the case of inquiry-based classes, the ways that students talk to each other and how they interpret the instructor's actions can make great differences in their learning. This paper describes results of research on patterns of social interactions in a college physics course for prospective elementary teachers. Students in this course developed physics concepts for themselves with support from particular pedagogical structures, collaborative group work, and special computer software. Data consisted of videotapes of class work, interviews, and collections of students' work. The paper extends Yackel and Cobb's \"sociomathematical\" norms (1996) to the  fields of physics, and introduces two \"sociophysics norms\" that emerged in the course. These were class criteria for accepting evidence and the obligation for each group to have a scientific model of magnetic materials that they could support with acceptable evidence. Implications of this study are that classroom norms seem to be influenced by the instructor, by pedagogical structures, and by students' actions, and that the development of norms seems to be part of the process of developing understanding.

        "author":["Amoo-Adare, Epifania"],
        "description":"This paper is a brief account and argument for using Built Environment Education Workshops (BEEWs) as a data collection method. The research is based on women of African descent and the connections among their social practices, the spaces that generate them and are generated by them, and the language they use to mediate and/or negotiate those spaces. Feminist popular education models and other relevant feminist perspectives are used to design the BEEWs. The paper notes that the research process and product are \"real\" and \"imagined\" effects of chaos theory. Chaos theory has been and will continue to be used as both metaphor and process to capture the dynamic amorphous layered reality of the city's postmodern, geohistoric condition, the \"place\" of women of African descent within  it, the role that building industry professionals play in defining the spaces in which these women live, the empowering possibilities of utilizing popular education to enable critical understanding of spatial politics, the varied critical theoretical frameworks used to illuminate and define the phenomenon, the foregrounding of a peculiar standpoint within this research agenda, the methods used to develop this standpoint and to gather research data, and lastly, the actual way that the final dissertation research results will be presented. The paper uses June Jordan's poetry to move the reader through the academic discourse. This use of both creative writing and academic discourse is an example of the layering effects of chaos theory, in which similar themes can be read in both texts.

        "description":"Elementary schools in Knox County, Tennessee employ music specialists who spend about one hour weekly instructing individual elementary classes in music. Students in those classes receive about 64 music lessons per school year. The music curriculum in Knox County includes the six major elements of music: melody, harmony, rhythm, style, expressive qualities, and form. Sequentially taught lessons using computers and music software as teaching tools should help the teacher cover all elements of music. Students have the opportunity to use their senses with multi-media software. A project was implemented with 30 second-grade students, randomly chosen from an inner city, at-risk Title I school and then randomly placed within one of two groups. &quot;Music Ace&quot; software was used as a  teaching tool to introduce beginning music notation to the treatment group. Additionally, the treatment group also learned to interpret that notation into pitch identification through singing specific pitches with the aid of &quot;Music Ace.&quot; A combination of Koday, Orff, and Dalcroze methods were used to teach the second group, the traditional group, the same beginning music notation and interpretation of notation into pitch identification. Eight lessons were taught to each group and then a posttest was given to individual students; individual posttest scores were compiled resulting in a group score. Each group's scores was compared by t-test and found to show no statistical difference in significance. (Contains a table, 2 figures, a 21-item bibliography, and 5 Web resources.)  (Author/BT)",

        "description":"This report describes a program designed to enhance social studies skills and knowledge. The target areas for enhancement are geography skills and community understanding. The targeted population is a second grade class in a rural Midwestern setting. The need for strengthening these skills was documented by observation, checklists, surveys, and pre- and post-tests. An analysis of the probable cause for lack of geography skills revealed that students do not have good definitions of geography and community or why they are important. Many thought they liked maps, but did not have a grasp of their purpose. The literature reviewed indicated that young children are not cognitively able to grasp some concepts set forth in geography. A review of the solution strategies proposed by the  research found in pertinent literature and combined with an analysis of the problem in the given setting identified several strategies for remediation. Constructivist learning methods, cooperative learning groups, and multiple intelligences were the main focus of the interventions chosen to help the students in this second grade class. Post-intervention data upheld the premise that these strategies would serve to raise the students' skills and understanding in the areas of geography and community. Following the intervention, they not only liked maps, but they also understood and used them well with the knowledge that all people in community situations share the common need to understand and be informed about their world.

        "description":"&quot;Transformation&quot; is a process whereby an existing, controlled (predominantly Protestant) or maintained (predominantly Catholic) school can &quot;transform&quot; to Grant Maintained Integrated or Controlled Integrated status (a school where Protestants and Catholics are educated together). Since 1996, this process has been promoted by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland (DENI) as the &quot;preferred&quot; route to integration (preferred over setting up new &quot;integrated&quot; schools). However, until this point there has been virtually no systematic research evidence that investigates the process in practice. This paper discusses research that &quot;mapped&quot; the process of &quot;transformation&quot; in six of the twelve transforming schools in Northern Ireland. Using both quantitative and qualitative data, the  study describes how teachers in &quot;transforming&quot; schools feel about the process of &quot;transformation.&quot; The study also discusses the factors that primarily influence these feelings. Finally, the paper examines at the implications of this research evidence for the way in which both teachers and principals are trained to implement the &quot;transformation&quot; process in schools in Northern Ireland.

        "author":["Tirri, Kirsi"],
        "description":"This paper reports findings from a study of Finnish academic Olympians of different ages who participated in Olympiad Studies in mathematics, physics, or chemistry during the years 1965-1997. The study focused special interest on the influences of home and school in contributing to the development of academic talent. The results of the Finnish study are compared to an earlier U.S. study using the same instruments. The Finnish Olympians were mailed a 14-page questionnaire and the self-confidence attitude attribute scales; their parents received a shorter version of the same questionnaire and the inventory of parental influence. Data included 150 males and 7 females. More than half of the Olympians were first-born children; parents had either a very high educational level or a very  low educational level; and parents had good incomes. Olympians and their parents were asked to rate the importance of family/school influences in development of academic talent, and parents rated these influences as more important than did the Olympians. Finnish Olympians emphasized their own interests and efforts as key factors to their talent development, as well as good teachers. They noted few hindrances to their talent development. More than half expressed the view that they would not have accomplished as much without the Olympiad program. Data are going to be compared with similar data from the United States, Germany, and Taiwan. (Contains 21 figures, 7 tables, and 11 references.) (BT)",

The theoretical rationale for such research is presented and findings are drawn from questionnaires to 1,800 students in England, France, and Denmark, and from individual and group interviews with a smaller sample of students in each country. The paper draws upon a socio-cultural perspective that emphasizes the context in which learning occurs. Student perspectives on the purpose of schooling and learning and on the teaching they receive are examined, and the &quot;constants&quot; and&quot;contexts&quot; of student experience in the three countries are discussed.

        "description":"This qualitative study, investigating the claims, concerns, and issues arising within the design stages of problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum units, was conducted during two masters-level classes during the summer of 1999. A hermeneutic dialectic discourse among veteran teachers (who were novice PBL curriculum designers) was facilitated by the instructor of the course. The 17 participating teachers evinced an interest in implementing problem-based learning but indicated a desire for support during construction of the actual units. The study was undertaken to uncover impediments to quality in the PBL curriculum design process. Findings from the study data include the &quot;quality&quot; criteria incorporated into the rubrics for evaluating each design product (the meet the problem  document, a curriculum alignment description, a sample know/need to know board, a sample problem statement, an anticipated problem map, a list of coaching questions, a resource list, a comparison of alternative solutions, a capstone performance description, an assessment instrument for the capstone performance, and a debriefing instrument) and the final Critiquing Guide designed by the stakeholders. Other conclusions within the study include such teacher perceptions as: confidence that teachers who had no previous training in PBL could create quality curriculum units; several design products had overlapping quality criteria; students in the class gained knowledge of rubric design; and these students were able to articulate reasons for implementing rubric design in their own classrooms.

        "description":"The Internet enables teachers to enhance the teaching and learning of history through quick and extensive access to primary sources. Introducing and using primary sources in the history classroom will almost certainly lead to active learning and development of critical thinking, reasoning, and problem solving. This Digest discusses: (1) types and uses of primary sources; (2) using the Internet to obtain primary sources; and (3) exemplary World Wide Web sites providing primary sources. Primary sources are not limited to printed documents such as letters, newspapers, diaries, and poems. Artifacts (art, pottery, articles of clothing, tools, and food), places (ecosystems, dwellings, and other buildings and structures), sounds (music, stories, and folklore), and images (paintings,  photographs, and videos/movies) can also be considered primary sources. Introducing and using primary sources in the history classroom leads to active learning and to the development of critical thinking and enhancement of the learning process by allowing students to construct their own understandings of people, events, and ideas. Precautionary measures to maintain safe learning environments when using online primary sources are given. Examples of user friendly and efficient search engine Web sites also are given. A few of the primary source sites offered include the American Memory Historical Collections for the National Digital Library (maintained by the Library of Congress), the National Security Archive (founded in 1985 by a group of journalists and scholars that had obtained  documentation from the U.S. government under the Freedom of Information Act), and the National Park Service (features over 2,300 National Historic Landmarks.

        "description":"This paper explains how a World Wide Web site was designed to assist preservice teacher education students in reflecting upon their learning and to assist a teacher educator to reflect upon his teaching in university classes. The students reflected on their learning experiences in university classes using a three-phase reflective framework: (1) analysis; (2) synthesis; and (3) theorizing. In the last phase, the students developed a metaphor to represent an optimum classroom learning environment. The Web site was designed using a FileMaker Pro database with a template for each influence on learning (personal, teaching, peer, and situational) to assist students in managing, sharing, and theorizing about their reflections. Students claimed that the Web site supported their  reflections and the metaphor helped them to conceptualize the dynamics of classroom relationships, which also provided ongoing data for teacher reflection.

An historical perspective and brief survey of the preceding decades concerning educational reform are given. Varying representative levels of criticism toward the elementary, middle school, and high school levels are discussed. A sample review of the criticism being made against higher levels of learning is also depicted, particularly at the undergraduate level in the nation's universities and colleges. In addition, a condensed reflection and evaluative emphasis on teacher preparation programs is included. The article is in two parts. The first part includes the survey and review of the literature as well as the citing of the problems stated. The second part deals with fashioning a  conceptual approach to addressing those challenges to schools, colleges, and departments of education noted in the first part of the article. This recommendation for infusion of teacher education programs with such an understanding is not meant to serve as an instructional sequence model. However, it is meant to serve as a request for readers to consider developing their own conceptual and operating models based upon the priorities they uniquely face and those voiced in this article.

Results suggested a need to investigate the program and its scope, implementation problems, and relation to other educational entities such as districts, universities, and teacher associations. The work described in this report occurred during the 1995-96 school year. The study included three parts. The first section: (1) examined total numbers of each Nevada endorsement issued on initial licenses within the last 3 years and endorsements for which there were corresponding validated competency tests; and (2) reviewed passing scores for nine specialty-area tests. The second  section described discussions by ad hoc committees representing varied perspectives on two program problems (communication and study materials/diagnostic information). The third section discussed ways to work together to help districts with recruitment and hiring and the Department with licensing. Findings are presented. Four appendixes include: (1) plans for comprehensive review of the Nevada Competency Testing Program for Educational Personnel; (2) the Competency Testing Review Committee; (3) the Northern Ad Hoc and Southern Ad Hoc Committees; and (4) participants at the Meeting of District Personnel Officers and Department Staff.

The Milwaukee Teacher Education Center's (MTEC's) urban mission is to prepare educators to teach in the real world classroom of urban schools. For example, teachers are prepared to work toward implementing the stated philosophy of the Milwaukee Public Schools, which espouses goals of multiculturalism and equity. Teachers learn the importance of helping diverse children in poverty learn and achieve. They are prepared as learners, assuming that it takes 3 years of on-the-job training to become a fully functioning urban teacher, and that professional growth must be ongoing. They are prepared to: (1) remain in teaching; (2)  integrate computers into teaching; (3) work with parents; (4) motivate students; (5) de-escalate school violence; (6) integrate several subject matters into problem-solving units; (7) offer social justice curriculum; and (8) work as teams.

Comments were analyzed using specific Essential Academic Learning Requirements (Washington State, 1997) in reading and four other categories including text support, conversation maintenance, off task remarks, or comments made by the teacher. Subjects participated in two different sets of literature circle groups which lasted 6 weeks each. Sixteen discussions were audiotaped and coded. Results indicate that all discussions had the largest number of comments in the categories of comprehension of story ideas and details and reading for literary experience. Groups which met without the teacher  made more off-task comments. This study concludes that the teacher's role will vary based upon students' skills and learning needs.

The project was designed in response to a government recommendation that all teacher training programs include courses designed to enable student teachers to understand Aboriginal history and Aboriginal viewpoints on social, cultural, and historical matters. The project involved designing, in cooperation with indigenous organizations and community members, universities, education authorities, and professional associations, guidelines for developing a core Indigenous Australian Studies subject, a sample model core Indigenous Australian  Studies subject, a teacher-oriented text, and sample resources for preservice primary teacher education courses. The bulk of the project was released and distributed to all Australian schools of teacher education and university Aboriginal education centers. Many universities have found the project materials to be an invaluable resource for helping to foster mutual respect and understanding between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.

The JUEP was designed to create sustained, high quality, professional development systems for inservice educators in three PDSs. The study explored how teachers at the end of their third year of the project rated their development of seven professional norms: collegiality, experimentation and risk taking, reflectivity, multicultural sensitivity, decision making, ongoing inquiry, and commitment to teaching. The study also examined the climate of these schools and teachers' attitudes toward the project. The 150 participating teachers completed a climate scale, a professional  norms scale, a series of demographic items, and one open-ended question which asked them to name ways that JUEP had impacted their classroom practice. Overall, teachers indicated that JUEP had a degree of success in achieving its goals. One-third of the teachers listed one or more examples of how JUEP influenced their classroom practice. Two overriding positive themes were collegiality and communication generated by the project and the team approach used (teachers, university faculty, and student teachers).

The paper begins with an argument about the convergence of didactic and pedagogical theory. It illustrates the endurance of European didactic thought, using examples from Spain. Five sections focus on: why didactics is not popular in the United Kingdom and United States; the overlap between pedagogy (as upbringing) and didactics (as schooling); the discourse of didactic thinking and applications in Spain; didaktika magna to applied didactics; and epistemological evolution in didactic analysis. The paper concludes that the recent history of didactic and pedagogic thought in Europe and North America is  neither simple nor linear. Semantic, geographical, historical, political, and confessional differences are involved. The overall conclusion is that neither field is static, and there is no point in searching for the true pedagogics of didactics. It is better to understand them in their historical, geographical, and political contexts. (Contains 27 references.) (SM)",

During the first year, 16 paraeducators successfully completed a series of mathematics courses taught using constructivist instructional methods. These user-friendly mathematics courses offered at a community college through the UPDATE program in 1998 had a positive impact on paraeducators' attitudes toward mathematics. In 1999, during the second year of the program, 14 of the same paraeducators enrolled in an introductory biology course taught using traditional methods (lectures and notetaking). Researchers administered two quantitative surveys, an attitudinal survey, and an instructional strategy  survey, and conducted a focus group. Pre- and post-intervention scores on the attitudinal survey were analyzed for any significant change in paraeducators' attitudes toward science. The instructional survey was also administered at the end of the course to collect information about teaching methods used and to learn how these methods impacted learning. Data from the surveys and focus group suggested that use of traditional instructional methods had a negative impact on paraeducators' attitudes toward teaching and learning science.

The notion of an intellectual and moral sensibility brings reason and emotion together. The idea of sensibility underlines the importance of the way in which teachers think and act, rather than solely what they say or do. The paper discusses the impact of teacher sensibility, explaining that a teacher's classroom presence, shaped by his or her sensibility, can influence students' own evolving sensibilities. Teacher candidates can deepen their intellectual and moral sensibilities by learning how to read the world carefully  and sympathetically. A moral and intellectual sensibility comes to life as candidates open themselves to the voice of the practice as embodied in the readings and experiences making up the teacher preparation program. The paper concludes that teachers' moral and intellectual sensibility, which must be cultivated, plays a dynamic role in whatever influence they have on students. A teacher education program can fund candidates' moral and intellectual sensibilities by expanding their horizons of understanding and feeling. (Contains 12 references.) (SM)",

Researchers conducted a meta-ethnography, which synthesized qualitative research and attempted to analyze processes and outcomes across many studies. Case studies of the collaboration process in PDSs were collected and screened, then themes were coded and interpreted. A literature search yielded 66 case studies. After screening, 20 case studies remained. Each case study was analyzed in terms of geographic region, type of partnership, urban or suburban setting, number of years in the partnership, and authors. Facilitators of the collaboration process that were interpreted from the 20 case studies were: obtaining needed resources from outside organizations; administrative  support, taking time to establish a shared vision; and the feeling that PDSs increase professional development. Barriers to collaboration included time, lack of rewards, the change process, district mandates, and space. The paper presents six recommendations to practitioners, schools, and teacher education institutions for beginning and sustaining a PDS. (Contains 56 references.) (SM)",

The study describes what happened when a TGfU approach was implemented as part of a regular eighth-grade physical education program in basketball. Three vignettes based on critical incidents generated from observation, interview, and diary data illustrate various aspects of the situatedness of learning. Analysis of the vignettes showed that the constructs  employed in cognitive, motor behavioral, and ecological approaches remained useful, but by themselves they provided incomplete explanations of learning to play games. Reworked within a situated perspective, the constructs provided theoretical tools for providing a more targeted approach to the pedagogy of TGfU. (Contains 27 references.) (SM)",

A typical classroom visit lasted 4-8 days. Specialists worked alongside teachers to demonstrate the proper use of technology and to model best practice pedagogy. Students used the technology to conduct scientific investigation. To be  eligible for Science Van visits, teachers had to participate in project workshops. Data from surveys, interviews, observations, and pretests/posttests of teachers and students indicated that the project effectively incorporated the five elements of professional development. Teachers reported increases in areas specifically targeted by the professional development and in their knowledge of state content standards. They gave the Science Van program high ratings in effectiveness. Students reported liking the Science Van visits very much.

Participants were three experienced middle school classroom teachers and their three student teachers. They worked in a school that had reasonable amounts of technological equipment. Data sources included field notes from classroom observations and teacher conversations and transcripts from semi-structured interviews. Data analysis indicated that while university coursework was useful for acquiring  content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge were more readily acquired within the teaching context. Student teachers brought with them current content knowledge of technology. Mentor teachers served as pedagogical guides in the process of acquiring educational technology pedagogical and pedagogical content knowledge.

Results indicated that most teachers planned to continue teaching for as long as possible and believed they were making a difference in their students' lives. They felt the need for better preparation before entering the classroom, particularly in the areas of educational technology and working with new English language learners. Most teachers felt they were not well prepared to  teach in ways that would help all students achieve high academic standards. Teachers' overall feelings of preparedness as they entered teaching most strongly related to: subject area knowledge and instructional strategies, proficiency in educational technology, and effective classroom management. Teachers valued opportunities for professional development.

The purpose of this study was to explore mentor teachers' ways of being and knowing as they work with interns in a newly created, inquiry-oriented professional development school. This investigation uses case study methodology informed by both ethnographic and phenomenological perspectives. Using these lenses and data collected over an 18-month period, the stories of two mentor  teachers are captured and analyzed. Three themes emerged within each case that characterized the unique work of each site-based teacher educator: teaching interns as teaching children, mentoring as decision making, and creating spaces as pedagogical tools. The three themes that shape the work of the first mentor offer insight into an artistic approach to mentoring. The three themes of the second case suggest an inquiry-oriented approach to mentoring.

        "description":"This study investigated how six mentor teachers understood and negotiated their roles as mentors in an elementary professional development school (PDS). Data were collected over 18 months from mentor and intern journals, field notes, interviews, e-mails, meeting minutes, and transcripts from PDS meetings. Each teacher participated in interviews regarding their motivation and teacher education experiences, experiences as mentors within the PDS, and thoughts associated with problems and possibilities of the PDS. Results are discussed according to three PDS phases. In the first phase, teachers were not committed to the renewal piece of the vision and were not always comfortable using their voices, though they often silenced their colleagues to protect their established ways of doing  business. In the second phase, teachers' work changed in meaningful ways as they incorporated interns into the classroom. Teachers grew professionally as they dialogued with interns. The mentor role broadened to include beginning teacher educators. In the third phase, mentors engaged in some form of inquiry, seeking to understand what inquiry was and how it was part of their work. They used observation as a tool for understanding inquiry and began to recognize inquiry as a professional development tool for interns. (Contains 26 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This paper examines the decisions, benefits, and difficulties in teaching educational psychology through a constructivist case study approach. Recent interest in and inquiry into constructivism, pedagogical content knowledge, and case study methodology are influencing the content and goals of educational psychology in teacher preparation. The content of educational psychology lends itself to authentic, active, and pragmatic applications of theory to school practices as well as to investigations of a variety of educational issues, perspectives, and contexts which can be viewed through case study, a constructivist problem-based approach to learning. Things to consider when organizing for case-based instruction include course content and setting, students, case sources, case  selection, teaching strategies and assignments, and assessment. An important step in organizing for case-based teaching is having a conceptual framework to organize and facilitate case analysis, discussion, and assessment. A five-step framework involves: identifying issues and facts in a case; considering different perspectives in a case; identifying professional knowledge; projections that might be taken; and considering likely consequences of particular actions. Case instructors must decide the kinds of assessment measures needed to match their desired outcomes. (Contains 16 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"Education policies of the European Commission and the Council of Europe stress the importance of cultural and language diversity. A white book by the European Commission on education and training recommends that every European citizen be able to communicate in at least 3 of the 12 officially recognized languages of the European Union by the end of high school. Simultaneously, there has been a major move toward using English within the 15 member states of the European Union. Against this backdrop, mother tongue teaching and learning as well as foreign language teaching/studying/learning are confronted with many new situations. Teacher education must provide the ability for prospective teachers to acquire the professional competence necessary to deal proactively with this  phenomenon. This paper uses Finland and Sweden as examples of developments within the European Union, presenting various solutions in teacher education which have been adopted in these Nordic countries. Solutions include teaching more foreign languages and teaching them earlier; providing immersion programs; providing bilingual education; and teaching old minority languages as new school subjects. The paper examines the cognitive benefits of multilingualism and discusses trends in language teaching and learning in Nordic countries. (Contains 43 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"An efficient way to help students achieve academically is to maximize the consistent attendance of permanent teachers in the classroom. Students nationwide are spending increased amounts of time with instructors other than their permanent teachers. A large contributor to the problem of teacher absenteeism is mandatory leave for professional development training programs. To combat teacher absenteeism caused by burnout, stress, or abuse of available teacher leave, districts have implemented an incentive program instead of a use them or lose them policy. Student achievement, to a large degree, depends on continuity of instruction. Research shows that interruption of instruction negatively affects academic achievement. Students often experience lack of instructional continuity due  to exposure to untrained substitutes who often do not have regular teaching certificates and are not qualified to be in the classroom. School districts must provide effective, comprehensive training for substitute teachers that addresses professional behavior, classroom management, legal and first aid issues, teaching and instructional strategies, fill-in activities, and substitute resource kits. Such training benefits students more than anyone else. Trained substitutes will most likely do a better job of maintaining instructional continuity, which is essential to student achievement.

        "description":"This paper discusses a study of Dutch secondary education reform, describing the background, noting implications for teacher learning, and arguing that learning supports professional development and derives from performance of activities that help teachers develop professionally. Based on a literature study, a conceptual model was developed in which characteristics of the individual, the task, and the work environment were related to performance of professional development activity. To explore the relevance of the conceptual model, two research questions were addressed: To what extent do teachers perform professional development activities? and What factors affect these activities? A survey was conducted with 542 teachers from 10 secondary schools to study these questions. The  survey looked at years of experience, professional attitudes, meaning attached to professional development activities, job stress, job demands, job control, social support, and developmental press. Results indicated that professional development activities focused on three types of activities related to different aspects of professional behavior. The frequency with which different professional development activities were performed differed significantly. The study provided evidence of many variables that predict the frequency of professional development activities. (Contains 27 references.) (SM)",

The study involved a systematic analysis of the files of student teachers who failed at one university from 1994-97. Failure of student teaching was defined as either choosing to quit student teaching or being removed from the experience. Results were coded as personal characteristics, performance indicators, or contextual factors. Results identified age, gender, number of previous institutions attended, and lower grades in methods classes as demographic characteristics of students who failed. The single biggest reason for students to withdraw from student teaching was the decision that teaching was not for them.  Personal circumstances were another primary reason for failure. Regarding performance indicators, students who failed displayed multiple skill deficiencies. Students who failed for contextual reasons usually did so because of conflict with cooperating teachers or placements. The paper presents a number of ways teacher education institutions can address the causes of failure, ranging from pre-admission screening to early field placement, counseling, selecting and educating cooperating teachers carefully, and documenting the internship.

Coherence leads to improved educational experiences for learners as teachers make their instructional decisions by using both information collected in the classroom about what and how their students are learning and information from external sources about what is important for students to learn. The collection of tools falls into five categories: (1) coherence (understanding the rationale), (2) learning (placing learning at the center of practice), (3) dialogue (establishing a dialogue), (4) reflection (developing reflective  practice), and (5) improving student learning (taking action). This publication presents tools and activities for each of the five areas.

Research shows that quality professional development can improve student achievement. Teachers report that professional development improves their teaching. Despite this, the American school system fails to provide sufficient professional development for teachers. There must be a national plan to direct staff development dollars and teacher time for learning. This plan would evaluate staff development and ensure that quality programs and strategies are encouraged to grow. The National Staff Development Council's set of standards and guidelines for staff development includes: set clear, high standards for  learning for all students; hold superintendents, principals, and teachers accountable; invest in teacher learning; review school improvement plans; involve all teachers in continuous, intellectually rigorous study of what and how they teach; embed opportunities for professional learning and collaboration into the school day; provide teachers with classroom assessment and action research skills; and recognize the importance of skillful school and district leaders.

It proposes the portal school concept as a viable approach for providing appropriate experiences for preservice teacher education programs that are consistent with new, expanded visions of literacy. Rather than holding classes on campus and visiting schools occasionally, preservice teachers enrolled in portal school projects meet in public schools for lectures, seminars, and demonstration lessons and for practice teaching. Researchers investigated issues viable in preservice  teachers' cases, journals, and lessons; possible issue variations in their cases related to school context; and whether contents of their cases illuminate instructional shortcomings. They examined and categorized 204 teaching cases, 189 journal entries, and 85 observation field notes for eight groups of preservice teachers. Analysis revealed that across three teaching contexts, there were nine difficult issues that teacher education programs and school systems should address. The portal school model offers one viable approach for addressing the challenges of collaboration in school-university partnerships. (Contains 39 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This study investigated practices, attitudes, and behaviors that experienced teachers used to motivate middle school students. Participants were 10 teachers from one Virginia middle school. The teachers' classroom behaviors and teacher-student interactions were observed. Teachers completed interviews that asked about: their definition of motivation; characteristics of motivated and unmotivated students; general practices and behaviors that motivated students, including those used by the interviewee and those observed to be used specifically by other teachers; and observed connections between parent influences and student motivation. Results indicated that establishing a positive teacher-student relationship was a strong motivator. Teacher ability to meet diverse students' needs  was a motivating factor. When teachers presented connections between students' lives beyond the classroom and the material presented in school, students were motivated. Extrinsic motivators were only advocated as a means of getting total classroom involvement. Motivation was lowered when parents assumed student academic responsibility and/or placed excessive stress on the student. Motivation was enhanced when parents created an accepting and supportive relationship with their children while placing value on their children's education. (Contains 28 references.) (SM)",

        "author":["Amade-Escot, Chantal"],
        "description":"This study investigated how and why students modified instructional tasks, explaining modifications using the concept of didactic contract. The study focused on two theoretical perspectives in physical education (PE) research: didactic and ecological. The didactic paradigm examines relationships among teachers, students, and the content embedded in tasks during academic work. Didactic contract refers to the part of the negotiation process related to academic work. The ecological approach states that the ecology of PE focuses on cooperation rather than academic work. Teachers maintain cooperation by reducing demands in the instructional system. This study investigated how students' relationship to the content taught determined the modification of the task, influenced their work,  and affected academic achievement. Data were collected during a middle school volleyball unit via field notes, teacher interviews, and videotaped lessons. Usually, students modified the stated task. Continual, inevitable changes in the content taught were observed when it was brought into play in the instructional system. This is congruent with the ecological perspective. Students stretched the didactic contract to test their capabilities in successfully completing the task. This caused a breach in the didactic contract. Such breaches were due to the teaching-learning process itself rather than poor accountability. (Contains 13 references.) (SM)",

Previous studies found that most schools did not survey their students' athletic interests, and girls' participation in athletics varied by school. This report used data collected through requests to Minnesota schools under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act. Data were collected on girls' participation and the use of student interest surveys. Results indicated that many schools had made significant progress toward gender equity in athletics. Where opportunities existed, girls were participating in athletics, and their participation was growing. However, participation of boys and girls was not  substantially proportionate in all schools. State-level participation data were incomplete, incorrect, and underutilized. Most schools were not regularly surveying students' sports interests, and many athletic directors viewed interest surveys as a burden.

Similar to related work in the Big-Five Theory of Personality, researchers posited a Big-Two-Factor Theory of motivation orientation and evaluated the implicit assumption that selected motivation constructs can be represented as higher-order Performance and Learning factors. They collected test-retest data (multi-item scales designed to measure eight motivational constructs) from elementary school students. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) provided good support for each of the eight scales. Higher order CFA models fit the data reasonably well for each time considered separately and  the well-defined, higher-order Learning and Performance factors. For combined pretest/posttest data, the substantial test-retest correlations for first-order factors were not adequately explained by higher order factors. A multi-cohort, multi-occasion analysis of mean differences showed strictly linear declines that were smaller for Learning-related scales than Performance-related scales. While results supported the Big-Two-Factor Theory, there was considerable variance in each of the eight scales that was reliable at any one time and stable over time but unexplained by the higher-order factors.

Consistent with a priori predictions based on the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE), higher school-average achievements led to lower academic self-concepts (contrast effect), whereas higher perceived school status had a counter-balancing positive effect on self-concept (reflected glory, assimilation effect). The negative BFLPE was the net effect of counterbalancing influences, stronger negative contrast effects, and weaker positive assimilation effects, so that controlling perceived school status led to  purer, and even more negative, contrast effects. Attending a school where school-average achievement is high simultaneously results in a more demanding basis of comparison for one's own accomplishments (the stronger negative contrast effect) and a source of pride (the weaker positive assimilation effect).

Data collection included classroom observations, surveys of teachers and principals, student academic achievement data (from the district database), and focus groups. Participants rated the training highly. The training model enabled most teachers to receive a consistent message on critical instructional methods. Teachers integrated many of the instructional methods into classroom practice. There was considerable variance in the quality of instruction delivered by individual teachers.

The next section offers an overview of the seminars, focusing on: the curricular choices the instructor made in developing the content and activities; the students' questions that initially  drew them to the seminars; what the students considered valuable aspects of the course; and descriptions of several individuals' work in the seminars. Successes in teaching these seminars included: students gained a variety of insights, learning to view themselves as moral educators rather than just classroom managers; many learned to see the role of teacher as a moral presence; and students acquired a moral language to talk about the dilemmas in teaching in their schools.

Risk is difficult to define. Consequences of risk can include stress and burnout, absenteeism, and attrition. Research shows that everyday events, even positive ones, cause stress, and chronic and traumatic negative stress can lead to many forms of illness and maladjustment. Leading stressors include student misbehavior and teachers' own characteristics. Symptoms of stress and burnout include anger, anxiety, depression, fatigue, frustration, substance abuse, psychosomatic symptoms, family crises, and reduction in commitment to students. School reform and working conditions can contribute to teacher burnout. Teachers'  attendance is influenced by both organizational practices and attendance barriers (transportation, illness, and family responsibilities). Teachers with higher job satisfaction and involvement tend to be absent less frequently. The immediate atmosphere of the school environment is a primary reason for teacher attrition. Many external, employment, and personal factors contribute to teacher attrition. There are some unique patterns of risk factors in Pacific schools that relate to cultural events, environmental factors, family/village social roles, and culturally sanctioned time off. A graphical representation of what research suggests about risk factors is presented. (Contains 22 references.) (SM)",

The program incorporates four recruitment principles: concern for various aspects of the issue and readiness to tackle them; commitment to the program; collaboration among all involved; and creativity in developing the program. Its goals are to: increase the quantity of teachers, specifically minorities and males; increase the quality of instruction for urban children; and enhance the university's teacher preparation and inservice teacher development programs. The paper describes selection and recruitment procedures; eligibility criteria; and curriculum development. Ongoing workshops and seminars are  described. They focus on: respectful attitudes and beliefs that all children can learn; knowing students by becoming familiar with their homes, cultures, and communities; providing stimulating, challenging, and meaningful instruction; identifying local community and agency support to meet students' needs; and managing the classroom. Academic and nonacademic support services are provided to participants as needed. Program evaluation indicates that it has strong support services; useful seminars; collaborative college-school relationships; institutional support; staff commitment; and a good reputation. Results suggest that preparing paraprofessionals as teachers for urban classrooms is one way to increase teacher diversity. (Contains 22 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"The Optional Extended Year (OEY) program was initiated in Texas in 1995 and was first implemented in the Austin Independent School District (AISD) in 1996. The OEY is designed to add an extended school year and reduce student retention through four school-day options: (1) extended day; (2) extended week; (3) intersessions for year-round schools; and (4) summer school. Participating schools have latitude in the type of student support that is offered, and the faculty and administration of each school select their own methods of monitoring student performance. In 1998-1999 65 schools (50 elementary and 15 middle schools) offered OEY programs attended by 4,380 students. Retention rates for OEY students increased that year, a fact that is partially explained by an increase in program  participation and a change in the OEY promotion policy. Results from the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) suggest that the OEY extended week program is particularly successful with middle school students, but no similar pattern could be determined for elementary schools. Overall, however, middle school students who participated in OEY had lower TAAS passing rates than elementary school students. It is suggested that administrators study objective-level TAAS data for program participants when planning future OEY opportunities. (SLD)",

        "description":"ExceL through Innovation (ExceL) is a local funding initiative of the Austin Independent School District (AISD), Texas, created to enhance elementary student achievement through innovative programs designed at the campus level for the specific students served. By 1998, 68 campuses were receiving ExceL funds. In spring 1998, principals of the ExceL schools completed grant continuation surveys, and in 1999, principals completed an additional evaluation survey. The evaluations showed that 20% of the campuses met all of their benchmarks related to the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS), and 38% met some of their benchmarks for this standardized test set. Forty-two percent met none of their TAAS benchmarks. Some 38% of campuses met all of their non-TAAS benchmarks.  Instructional programs varied a great deal in type and in degree of innovation. The most common uses of ExceL funds were mathematics, literacy, writing, parental involvement, and science. Campus staff development programs varied in cohesiveness and in the degree to which they were related to instructional programs. The most common topics were literacy, mathematics, assessment, technology, and curriculum alignment/unit development. The majority of ExceL principals reported that the program had favorable impacts on student achievement, and most reported that the ExceL budgets were adequate for their ExceL program needs. After examining program evaluation results, the evaluators recommend that program funds be allocated competitively and that campus funds should be monitored more closely.  Three appendixes describe ExceL program costs by campus for three school years. (SLD)",

Occasionally, only a small subset of the items in the pool may have actual calibrations, while the remainder of the items may only have classical item statistics, (e.g., &quot;p&quot;-values, point-biserial correlation coefficients, or biserial correlation coefficients). Transformations can be applied to the classical statistics to obtain rough estimates of the item parameters from a three-parameter logistic item response model. These estimates, in turn, can be improved by linking them to items with actual calibrations from a program such as BILOG. The resulting item parameter estimates can then be used in a computerized classification test (CCT). An evaluation of the results of using such estimated parameters  in simulated CCTs is presented in this paper. Seven simulated item pools were used. Results lead to the suggestion that when considering use of such augmented parameter estimates as those produced by the linking procedures in this paper, consideration be given to the sources of possible error and their effects on the outcomes of the test.

The paper examines how a number of changes in the process and scoring of the Anchorage Writing Assessment affected the ability to generate consistent ratings of student work. Descriptive statistics from the 1997-1998 and 1999-2000 Anchorage writing assessments for grades 5, 7, and 9 are presented. The writing folio and teacher directions were changes to encourage teachers and students to follow the step-by-step process, encourage editing, and help students recall the traits of good writing. No special student preparation was made, but new prompts were  developed, with two parallel prompts at each grade level. Allowing student choice of a prompt was a major change that was expected to have a positive effect on the quality of student writing. A more diverse group of raters and scorers was established, with a smaller proportion of teachers than before and less time for scorer training. In the 1999-2000 assessment, scorers were given anchor papers to improve consistency. The size of scoring groups was reduced, and scorers were given more positive feedback. Empirical results from the assessments show that the changes did not result in an increased reliability of scoring and did not improve the role that scores play as valid indicators of student performance as writers. Additional study will be necessary to achieve the assessments' goals.  (Contains 32 tables and 28 references.) (SLD)",

The biggest chunk of this money was used to fund challenge grants in the nine largest U.S. cities. The three case studies and commentary in this report evaluate the success of the Annenberg Challenge grant in three of these cities: New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Overall, they find that the schools systems on the whole have been largely unresponsive. It is concluded that the reason that these grants did not accomplish more was because the idea on which they were based, that public schools lack expertise and that talented and motivated outsiders working with the system can provide it, is wrong.

Although they wield immense power over what is actually taught in the classroom, these professors are senior members of a field that lacks many features of a fully developed profession. The judgments of education &quot;experts&quot; frequently appear to be unconstrained and sometimes altogether unaffected by objective research. The first section of this essay provides examples from reading and mathematics curricula that show experts dispensing unproven methods and flitting from one fad to another. The middle section describes how experts, for ideological reasons, have shunned some solutions that do display robust evidence of  efficacy. The following sections show how public impatience has forced other professions to &quot;grow up&quot; and accept accountability and scientific evidence. The paper concludes with a plea to develop education into a mature profession. (Contains 27 endnotes.) (SLD)",

The initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation, provides long-term, high quality professional development to build the instructional capacity of more than 2,000 AISD mathematics teachers. This evaluation describes ACME professional development in its second year of implementation. It focuses on the roles and teamwork of ACME professional development facilitators, teachers' experiences in ACME professional development, effects on teachers' knowledge and skills, and implementation of the ACME. Data were gathered through: (1) questionnaires completed by  237 teachers and 83 principals ; (2) interviews with 10 teachers, as well as administrators and ACME staff; (3) observations of professional development and 50 classroom mathematics lessons; and (4) examination of district documents. A key ACME strength was the way ACME core members work together and their vision of high quality standards-based professional development. ACME professional development provides many opportunities for teachers who engage in its activities actively. Some challenges were identified, mainly in finding ways to improve teachers' participation within the professional development sessions. Appendixes contain the teacher questionnaire, the teacher interview form, the principal questionnaire, the classroom observation guide and protocol, the post-observation interview  guide, and other surveys and interview guides.

Much of the fanfare accompanying \"get tough\" policies for failing students and schools has tempered as policymakers begin to see the complexity of raising student achievement dramatically in a short period of time. Education assessment systems are improving, but they are not as good as policymakers assume or as students deserve. Even the most severe critics of high-stakes testing acknowledge that assessments are necessary for accountability and diagnostic purposes, but relying on a single test for decisions about systems and individual students is fraught with difficulties. Using multiple measures could encourage schools to focus less on a single measure and more on improving achievement generally. In considering the issue of  high-stakes tests, it is necessary to assure that the tests are psychometrically and technically sound and to determine the impact on teacher and student behavior. It is also necessary to ensure that the tests will pass legal review and that tests really contribute to accountability. (Contains 16 references.) (SLD)",

The purpose of the brief is to identify some causes of the low performance of marginalized students, and then offer research-based solutions for what district and state policymakers can do to help teachers improve the academic achievement of these students. Reasons for low achievement are grouped into six main areas: (1) weak or inappropriate curricula; (2) ineffective instruction; (3) disengaging classroom discourse; (4) poor student self-concept; (5) unsuccessful adjustment to school culture; and (6) prejudice. Among the ways to improve student achievement are: provide all students  with rigorous curricula; help teachers improve instruction; provide support to students; create smaller classes and school units; increase parent involvement; identify and fix the ways low performance is manufactured; and establish strong, yet fair, accountability.

These descriptions of content, called achievement level descriptions (ALDs), were initially conceptualized as exemplary statements of the knowledge and skills students should have at the various levels. Gradually, over the past decade the descriptions have evolved into comprehensive, rather than exemplary, statements of assessment content that must reflect the subject matter item pools to ensure consistency. This paper traces the policy development of the ALDs, discusses the various approaches to developing the ALDs over the past 10 years, and reviews the form and function of the ALDs in  the current NAEP context. The paper suggests that ALDs should be retained and that they play an important role in shaping the end results from the NAEP and providing replicability in the process. The ALD process seems to be working; however, the ALDs may not serve the reporting function very well. Several approaches could remedy this weakness to help make NAEP results understandable for the U.S. public. (Contains 18 references.) (SLD)",

However, the measurement of this construct is the subject of current debate, which includes critical examination of predominant instruments used to assess teacher efficacy. The present study extends this critical evaluation and examines sources of measurement error variance in the Teacher Efficacy Scale (TES), historically the most frequently used instrument in the area. Reliability generalization was used to characterize the typical score reliability for the TES and potential sources of measurement error variance across studies. Other related instruments were also examined with regard to measurement integrity. The 52  articles selected yielded 213 useful observations, and 86 reliability coefficients. Findings suggest that the psychometric difficulties of the general teaching efficacy subscales are problematic with regard to measurement error, but that the TES, with one subscale exception, yielded the most variable reliability coefficients of all the instruments.

In spite of the small sample, observations from the study highlight issues test developers might want to consider in determining how to present a test. Several factors were identified that might lead an examinee to respond to more than just item content when giving an answer: page and line breaks, passage and item layout features, highlighting, and item characteristics. Other factors include navigational features such  as scrolling, item review, item preview, and omit capability. Examinee characteristics contributed to many of the observed mode effects, especially examinee carelessness. Care should be taken to ensure that the examinee is responding to item content only and not to inherent features associated with the test administration mode. (Contains 16 references and 16 tables.)

        "description":"The level of standardized effect sizes obtained by chance and the use of significance tests to guard against spuriously high standardized effect sizes were studied. The concept of the \"protected effect size\" is also introduced. Monte Carlo methods were used to generate data for the study using random normal deviates as the basis for sample means to be compared using one-way analysis of variance. Standardized effect sizes were generated for 5000 replications within each combination of number of groups from 2 to 10 and sample sizes from 5 to 100 in steps of 5, resulting in 900,000 total replications. Results indicate that the significance test does provide some protection against judging spuriously high standardized effect size values as being meaningful. Applying a statistical  significance test does substantially reduce the proportion of standardized effect sizes that achieve small, medium, or large criteria levels by chance. Perhaps the arguments should not be about using either statistical significance testing or effect sizes. Instead, the focus should be on finding ways to combine the philosophies and methods of both to make decisions about group differences. (Contains 5 figures. 6 tables, and 36 references.) (SLD)",

The interdisciplinary program, which integrated English, Algebra, Biology, and World History, developed and was expanded to all students, including an honors group. This study focuses on students in the Class of 2000, tracking the initial members of the class and subsequent enrollees. So far, the study has followed these students through 3 years; fourth-year additions will be grades for these students' senior year, in which there are no interdisciplinary classes, and college attendance rates. The first 3 years of the study have shown that behaviors by students in the  interdisciplinary program are more positive than those for discipline-based students, as indicated by lower absence and suspension rates. Academic performance of interdisciplinary students is higher, and scores on the Iowa Test of Educational Development are equal or higher for the interdisciplinary group. Teachers of the interdisciplinary program expressed a strong preference for the instructional approach. An appendix contains a chart of Iowa Test of Educational Development scores. (SLD)",

        "description":"The use of latent class analysis for establishing student performance standards was studied. Latent class analysis (LCA) is an established procedure for investigating the latent structure of a set of data. LCA presumes that groups, classes, or respondents differ qualitatively from one another, and that these differences account for all of the relationships in the data. A student assessment instrument was developed consisting of a 10-item multiple choice component and 2 performance assessment tasks. The instrument was completed by 191 seventh and eighth grade mathematics students. The latent class procedures provided information regarding the qualitative differences among the student responses. A series of latent class models was explored using binary and continuous indicators.  For this sample of student responses, the LCA procedure indicated that a two-group structure was the most appropriate model for explaining the differences in student performance. Perhaps the most important finding from the study deals with the extent to which the varying standard-setting procedures rendered comparable conclusions regarding what constitutes proficient performance. Another implication of the findings is that if empirical methods can be shown to render determinations regarding student proficiency that are comparable to the more common, and more costly, judgmental approaches, these methods could be used more often to support the determinations made with the judgmental approaches.

Although several simulation studies have examined this, few studies have been conducted using data obtained from actual test administrations. In this study, open-ended mathematics items from a mandated state test, previously shown to function differentially in favor of proficient writers, were hypothesized to be multidimensional. (Data were obtained from 65,333 fourth graders and 65,279 seventh graders taking the state mathematics tests.) Only these items comprised the second dimension, considered to be mathematical communication, while all of the mathematics items defined both the unidimensional model and the first factor of the  multidimensional model, considered to be general mathematical ability. The pattern of examinee placement into four different proficiency level classifications, previously determined using the bookmark standard setting procedure, was compared for both the unidimensional model and the first dimension of the multidimensional model. The majority of examinees placed into different levels was placed into higher levels of proficiency by the multidimensional model. Further analyses indicated that the average level of mathematical communication differed for examinees placed into different levels by the two models. Examinees with higher estimates of mathematical communication tended to be placed into a higher proficiency level, while those with lower estimates of mathematical communication tended  to be placed into lower proficiency levels by the unidimensional model.

        "description":"The ability to delay gratification among learners could serve as an effective learning strategy useful to diminish the detrimental effect of test anxiety. Academic delay of gratification refers to students' postponement of immediately available opportunities to satisfy impulses in favor of pursuing chosen important academic rewards or goals that are temporally remote but ostensibly more valuable. Using hierarchical regression analysis, this association was explored for 364 students. An association was found between academic delay of gratification and test anxiety once motivational, cognitive, and self-regulated factors are controlled. These findings suggest that academic delay of gratification may serve to enhance students' goal enhancement, which in turn results in high academic  achievement. These results also suggest that delay of gratification may function as a learning strategy that buffers the detrimental effect of test anxiety by helping learners protect academic goals from nonacademic alternative strategies. These results also indicate that self-efficacy, regulation of time, and study environment are negative predictors of test anxiety, while delay of gratification, extrinsic goal orientation, and rehearsal are positive predictors of test anxiety.

        "description":"This paper describes the method that the Minneapolis Public School system (MPS), Minnesota, uses to measure school and student performance. MPS uses a multifaceted system that both captures and accounts for the complexity of a large urban school district. The system incorporates: (1) a hybrid model of critical indicators that report on level of performance, cross-cohort changes, growth or gain scores, and value-added measures; (2) specific standards, set in a collaborative manner by stakeholders and then aligned with MPS criteria and real-world consequences; and (3) a cycle of continuous school improvement planning. The system is an example of how value-added indicators can be, and should be, included in any fair accountability model designed to evaluate the effectiveness of  schools. The expanded growth model addresses the differential balance of student characteristics across MPS schools. Evaluating the overall performance of schools based on a set of indicators allows the MPS to evaluate the effectiveness of the school district in meeting the needs of all its students. Continuous school improvement is based on detailed information reports provided to all school sites, the &quot;School Information Reports.&quot; These documents set the stage for site-based analysis and planning.

        "description":"The kernel of the Angoff method of standard setting (W. Angoff, 1971) would seem to be the judgment of whether a minimally competent person could answer an item on a test correctly or not. So it would seem that any procedure that requires independent judgment of the correctness or incorrectness of a response to items for a minimally acceptable examinee would merit being labeled as an Angoff method. Standard setting methods that use the Angoff kernel can be quite different in practice, but they may be given the same label in the literature on standard setting. The kernel for the modified Angoff method is not well-defined, but for this paper, it is defined as judgments of the proportion of correct responses for minimally qualified examinees on each item on a test. A look at the  American College Test/National Assessment Governing Board (ACT/NAGB) standard setting process for 1992 shows that the definition of the kernel has evolved into something that only contains the essence of the modified Angoff kernel in the first round of ratings. Once the holistic information about test and item performance is provided following round one, it can no longer be argued that panelists are performing independent item-by-item ratings. Labeling a standard setting process by the summary description of the kernel is no longer adequate. The ACT/NAGB method is a multi-round process with a modified Angoff kernel for the first round, holistic feedback, and normative information for later rounds, and direct specification of cutscores on the score scale in the final round.

The study also explored the relationship of the DIF and group differences at the test level. There are generally two types of osteopathic preclinical curriculum: traditional discipline-based and organ system-based. The June 1998 administration of COMLEX was used. This examination involved 800 multiple-choice items and 2,122 students from 17 osteopathic schools. Of these students, 578 studied an organ-system-based curriculum. The study reveals that the directions of the influences of curriculum type were consistent at the test and item levels, but the  magnitude of the influences was minimal. At the total examination level, students from the system-based curriculum performed better but with no practical significance. At the item level, the majority of items were immune from the impact of curriculum, while more items of those that had significant DIF favored students in organ-system based curricula. It is concluded that the advantages of students in the system-based curricula on the total examination were due in part to items discriminative against students in the discipline-based curricula.

The independence of these methods is important to the validity of the score recommendations.

The three IRT models were fit to the dichotomous response data from every sample, and all three showed adequate fit for the MCAT data, with the 1P model item estimates having the smallest estimation error, although the differences among 1P, 2P, and 3P models were very small in magnitude. Evidence was found to support the conclusion that item and ability parameters are stable/invariant with respect to gender and racial/ethnic and language groups for all models. Ability estimates also appear to be invariant with respect to test difficulty for all models. Nine appendixes contain data tables that supplement the discussion.

Cervero's (1982) comprehensive model of continuing professional education. A total of 344 registered nurses returned questionnaires about CE. Using a researcher-developed 37-item instrument, 12 items were identified as most important in influencing change. The top three items were potential benefit to the patient, perceived value of the proposed change, and extent to which the change addressed a relevant practice problem. A unifying theme among the three items was their strong practice orientation. All four of Cervero's categories (nature of the learner, the CE program, the proposed change, and the social system) were  represented in the top 12 items, with items related to the proposed change and the social system rated the highest. A principal components analysis with varimax rotation resulted in five subscales (CE Program, Difficulty in Implementing, Willing and Able, Experience and Education, and Application to Practice) and accounted for 47% of the explained variance in variables influencing the likelihood of practice change. The findings reinforce the usefulness of Cervero's notion of a multivariate framework when studying the relationship between CE and practice change. (Contains 2 tables and 38 references.)

        "description":"This interpretive study of the implementation of a school-based assessment scheme of biology practical work in Hong Kong examines the struggles of three teachers with the issue of fairness in relation to their classroom actions. Though the teachers' discourses were dominated by, and their classroom actions were pre-eminently influenced by, the notion of fairness, they did so in three qualitatively different ways: (1) fair in the sense of assessing students on a fair basis; (2) fair in the sense of not jeopardizing students' chances to learn the subject matter while they are being assessed; and (3) fair in the sense of not depriving students' opportunities of receiving an all-round education. The implication is that assessment innovation is a necessary but not sufficient mechanism  for changes within the educational system. It should be undertaken with full regard to problems of teacher interpretation and mediation at the classroom level. Otherwise, this will ruin the best intentions behind the assessment innovation.

By attending to the performativity of educational discourse, its productivity and effects, it will no longer be necessary to attribute motivation, purpose, or conspiracy to the agents of humanism (authors, researchers, teachers, and administrators).

Students in each college were treated as forming the applicant pool for a more select college, and the top two-thirds of the students were selected using high school grade point average combined with either SAT I scores or the average of three SAT II scores. Included in the sample were 2,000 students whose best language was not English. These students had a better chance of being &quot;admitted&quot; with selections based on SAT II (subject test) scores than with selections based on SAT I (reasoning scores). Much of this advantage was the result of  relatively high scores on language tests that could easily be part of the SAT II average. However, even when language tests were excluded from the SAT II average, non-native speakers were still slightly more likely to be selected with SAT II than SAT I. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"This paper describes the design and function of Louisiana's statewide student-level database, the Student Information System (SIS). In Louisiana the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education adopted the dropout definition of the National Center for Education Statistics for use by all Louisiana public schools in the 1989-1990 school year. In 1993, the state implemented the SIS, and in 1994-1995 the state began reporting dropout statistics extracted from the SIS, bringing state dropout reporting into compliance with federal dropout definitions. The SIS consists of individualized records on the nearly 800,000 students enrolled in Louisiana public schools statewide. The SIS makes it possible to track all students through identification numbers (usually the Social Security  number) and record suspensions and expulsions as well as dropouts. Examination of the past 5 years of dropout statistics indicates a sharp increase in Louisiana's dropout rate between 1994-1995 and 1995-1996. This dramatic increase is due to systemic changes in the procedure used to collect and report data. The SIS now is an effective and sophisticated method for tracking the movement of students through the public education process. An appendix contains definitions for SIS entry and exit codes.

        "description":"The comparability of computerized and paper-and-pencil tests was examined from cognitive perspective, using verbal protocols rather than psychometric methods, as the primary mode of inquiry. Reading comprehension items from the Graduate Record Examinations were completed by 48 college juniors and seniors, half of whom took the computerized test first followed by the paper-and-pencil version, and half of whom took the paper-and-pencil test before the computerized test. Participants were asked to think aloud as they answered the test questions. The verbal protocols were transcribed and coded for interpretation. There was a greater frequency of reading comprehension utterances during the paper-and-pencil test, but these were largely accounted for by the use of physical aids to  identify important information in the passage. Many participants said that they felt disadvantaged during the computerized test by not being able to write on the passage and test questions. The frequently used strategy of marking the test did not seem to produce any cognitive benefits, however. There was slight evidence of a working memory load while answering the questions on the computerized tests, but overall there were few mode differences and the magnitude of differences was very small. Nearly all participants used the same overall test-taking strategy on both test formats. The first test given, which was less interesting and more difficult, exposed more of the mode effects than the more interesting second test.

The properties of the procedure were compared with those of the Davey and Parshall (1995) and the Stocking and Lewis (1995) (SLC) conditional multinomial procedures within the purview of estimating examinee's abilities. Each of the exposure control methods was incorporated into the item selection procedure and the adaptive testing progressed based on the CAT design established for this study. The advantages and disadvantages of these strategies were considered under four item pool sizes and two desired maximum exposure rates and were  evaluated in light of test security, test overlap rates, utilization of the item pool, and conditional standard errors of measurement. Also, the issue of the appropriate conditional sample sizes in deriving the exposure control parameters was considered in the present study. Simulation results show no effect of using the four conditional sample sizes. The SHC produced the most satisfactory results in terms of item security and test overlap rates followed by the SLC method. Results also show that as long as the control for item exposure was not exercised, optimal items could be administered to almost every examinee under any of the four item pools. Findings of this study provide useful insights on how item pool sizes and maximum item exposure rates affect the performance of the exposure  control methods.

The effectiveness of this standardization approach was compared through simulation with the one-parameter logistic (1PL) and three parameter logistic (3PL) models based on the criteria of the Pearson product-moment correlation, the mean square error, variance, and squared bias. In light of estimating the item difficulty values, the differences of the performance between the 3PL and standardization methods were small, but the differences between the 1PL and these two methods were large. For the estimation of point biserial correlations, the 3PL model seemed to perform better than the standardization method, and  the standardization method performed better than the 1PL model. Although the standardization method did not outperform the 3PL model for the design considered in this study, it could be promising when smaller sample sizes are used. This method may be recommended for use in conjunction with the item response models for the test development when the pretesting sample sizes are small. By employing the classical measurement framework to obtain pretest item statistics, the problem of inaccurate item response theory parameter estimates when limited calibration sample sizes are available can be avoided.

This simulation study suggests that the magnitude of TIE inflation is increased, and the type of items that show inflation are somewhat broadened, under the realistic scenarios of ability distributions that differ not only in means but also in variances or variances alone. There were several conditions for which unequal variances in the ability distributions, either alone, or in combination with unequal means, produced practically important TWI inflation when no such inflation was observed under unequal means alone. This occurred  primarily for the hard and medium difficulty items with high discrimination and on the short test with the total sample size of 2,000, but it was also observed for the medium-length test. The most peculiar finding was the aberrant behavior of the highly discriminating hard items, which was the only item to show marked TIE inflation due to unequal variances alone when only rare mild inflation was observed under the combination of unequal variances and unequal means.

The first report summarizes the findings from Phase 1 of the study, which focused on teacher responses to closed-end, written survey questions. In Phase 1, 921 elementary, 597 middle, and 850 high school teachers were surveyed. They were asked about their grading and classroom assessment practices for a &quot;typical&quot; first semester class. Elementary school teachers indicated that academic factors clearly are most important in determining grades, but that related factors, such as improvement, effort, ability level, and class participation also make a significant contribution. The variety of responses  shows large differences in how teachers emphasize different factors. Approximately 20% of grades given were &quot;A&quot;s. Results for secondary school teachers show little variation between grade levels or subject matter. As with elementary school teachers, academic performance was the most important grading factor, but effort, homework, and extra credit also entered into grading. Phase 2 of the study focuses on interviews with 28 teachers. The analysis of interview data indicates that there is tension between two sources of influence on teacher decision-making concerning assessment and grading practices. One source is teacher beliefs and values and another is external pressures and constraints. These pressures include parent demands and informing parents of student progress, school division  policies, skills needed by students once they graduate, practical constraints and state-mandated high-stakes multiple-choice testing. The state test seems to have become a significant influence on teacher decision making. An appendix to Phase I contains the teacher surveys. (Contains 20 tables and 60 references.) (SLD)",

In applying IRT to CAT, there are certain considerations that are essential, and yet tend to be neglected. These essential issues are addressed in this paper, and then several ways of eliminating noise and bias in estimating the individual parameter, theta, of person \"a\" are proposed and discussed, so that accuracy and efficiency in ability estimation can be increased. The content validity of the ability dimension is emphasized, and the idea of core test items is proposed. Devices are suggested to eliminate noise from multiple-choice items by using the nonparametric estimation of operating characteristics effectively in pilot studies. The use of  the normal ogive model is suggested instead of the three-parameter logistic model. It is further suggested that several graded response items be used at the beginning of the CAT to avoid the influence of bias and lack of information inherent in dichotomous response items. The Weighted Likelihood Estimate of T. Warm (1989) and its expanded form for general discrete responses are discussed as an effective method of eliminating bias in ability estimation, and the usefulness of Warm's weight function as a prior is discussed. Use of the modified test information function is suggested for the same purpose. (Contains 10 figures and 18 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"In 1999 a validation study of the 1998 Civics Assessment of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) was conducted, combining a similarity classification study and a booklet classification study. The rationale was that if the teachers who had participated in the 5-day achievement levels-setting process could not use the descriptions to judge student performance, it is unlikely that anyone could. If their classifications were very different from the performances in the test booklets, it would suggest that the cutpoints did not denote performance consistent with the achievement level descriptions (ALDs). Eleven eighth-grade teachers from the pilot study of achievement level setting panel participated. Teacher panelists tended to classify their own students higher than  their performance levels on the special form of the NAEP developed for this study. When the same teachers were asked to classify the performance of students represented in the special Civics NAEP test booklets, they tended to classify those at or below the empirical score classification of the students' performance. These findings suggest that standards set with a booklet classification method will be higher than those set with the item-by-item method used for the NAEP achievement level setting process. Even teachers well trained in the NAEP achievement levels tend to overestimate the knowledge and skills of their students with respect to the ALDs. Overall, however, results provide information needed to confirm that the general achievement levels-setting process appeared to &quot;work&quot; in that  panelists were able to use the ALDs in a different setting and for different purposes and the &quot;translations&quot; with respect to the score scale seem reasonably on target.

        "description":"Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is used in different contexts and uses different tools, such as those of computer conferencing, e-mail, and groupware. This article introduces the use of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as a methodology to visualize the data in CMC. FCA, which is based on a mathematical lattice theory, offers visual maps (graphs) with conceptual hierarchies. Combined with content analysis, FCA is proposed as a potential method for the analysis of CMC. In this study, three categories (social, cognitive, and metacognitive) from F. Henri's (1992) model for CMC content analysis were applied to FCA after a previous study used a content-analysis method based on Henri's model to convert data from a computer conference. On-line discussions (computer conferences) in an  applied educational psychology course were analyzed. The conferencing messages were converted by the content analysis and then scaled into single-values attributes to compile a lattice. This article provides an example of the application of FCA to CMC and shows its potential for analyzing on-line discourse. (Contains 3 tables, 13 figures, and 31 references.) (SLD)",

The sample included 437 undergraduate courses with 96 (21.2%) freshman courses, 140 (32.0%) sophomore courses, 119 (27.2%) junior courses, and 82 (18.8%) senior courses at National Hualien Teachers College, Taiwan, in the fall semester of the 1996-1997 academic year. The Student Ratings of Instruction form was used to measure student ratings of faculty performance. The results indicate that student enthusiasm, expected grade, and teacher grading standard are positively correlated with all five evaluation scores. Course difficulty is negatively corrected with all evaluation scores. The high semi-partial correlation coefficients  consistently appear in course difficulty, student enthusiasm, and grading standard with all five evaluation scores. None of these 75 correlation coefficients show substantial nonlinearity. The percentages of variance explained by different combinations of background variables are 49.8%, 61.6%, 71.0%, 61.3%, and 66.8% for preparation, coverage, skills, assessment, and overall, respectively. Four of the background variables consistently appearing in the final regression equations are student enthusiasm, course difficulty, grading standard, and expected grade.

Using a vignette from the Architectural Registration Examination and data for 326 cases with both human and computer scores available, this study reports on the usefulness of an approach based on classification trees (L. Breiman, J. Friedman, R. Olshen, and C. Stone, 1984) as a means of quality control. Five studies were carried out analyzing different aspects of the &quot;training set&quot; and making efforts to cross-validate the results of the analysis by applying the resulting classification trees to data that had not been used in the  development of the tree. The application of classification trees led to valuable insights with implications for operational quality control processes. Furthermore, classification tree methods were shown to be able to select cases for future quality control processes accurately and efficiently, thereby suggesting that future quality control selection procedures may be completely automated. However, further analyses are needed to establish whether classification trees can be relied on to identify cases that are the most likely to require some adjustment without incurring the potentially costly error of ignoring solutions that are likely to require adjustment.

To acquire comparable results, two stages of statistical exploration into an integrated model of motivation, learning strategies, and quality of teaching were used. The goal of the paper was to select variables that were as powerful as possible and to use them to produce a new factor model, applying both standard linear (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences [SPSS]) and Bayesian (BAYDA) statistical software. The second stage of the research, planned for the future, will involve efforts to produce sensible path models related to the theory. The study of motivation, learning strategies, and teaching used research in a Finnish  telecommunications company in which 156 respondents answered a questionnaire with 135 items. The statistical analyses used for variable selection are described. Research results indicate that both teaching style and subject material can influence study motivation and the use of learning strategies. Learning material can be described with respect to the degree that broad theoretical perspectives are developed, and the personal meaningfulness of the subject material or the drawing of logical conclusions from detailed evidence is emphasized. The new statistical methods described, especially the nonlinear approaches based on Bayesian networks, enable the application of statistical analysis to the study of student motivation and self-regulated learning.

Second, chi-square tests are often the result of weak or erroneous information about data.

The paper describes some effectiveness indicators based on data from posttesting students (i.e., testing them after they have completed a remedial course). The paper also discusses how prior selection and measurement error in the initial placement test and the posttest affect the indicators. An example is provided to illustrate the indicators and the effects of prior selection and measurement error. Pretest and posttest data were  obtained from students enrolled in 9 2-year institutions and 10 4-year institutions in a state postsecondary education system in which placement decisions are made using 1 of 2 screening tests, followed in some cases by a placement test. The numbers of pretested students were 4,434 for Algebra, 8,563 for Reading, and 6,281 for Writing.

SMI and SM5 seem to be somewhat unrealistic for practical use in large-scale performance assessments. SM2 would be least preferable among the five scoring modalities conceptualized in this study for large-scale performance assessments.

        "description":"Classical test theory is based on the concept of a true score for each examinee, defined as the expected or average score across an infinite number of repeated parallel tests. In most cases, there is only a score from a single administration of the test in question. The difference between this single observed score and the underlying true score is error. This paper focuses on accuracy as a function of particular observed scores, questioning whether a student's unknown true score is likely to be in the same category as the student's observed score. A limited set of test items was retrieved from a state-wide examination. Sixteen multiple-choice mathematics items for 3,000 students were scaled using the three-parameter logistic option. The primary conclusion from this study is that  classification accuracy functions based on observed scores look quite different from accuracy functions based on true scores. For some of the observed scores, the most likely true score is an adjacent classification category. A further exploration considered how observed scores are placed on the true score scale and whether using the same cut-points for true and observed scores is the best approach. The overall conclusion is that there is no way, short of a perfectly reliable test, of simultaneously maximizing observed score classification accuracy and the accuracy with which overall population distributions are estimated. Nonetheless, observed score classification accuracy curves do provide information about individual observed scores that is quite useful. These curves also provide a way  of illustrating the consequences of particular decisions about the scaling and equating of performance category subscores.

Advocates seem to think that there is no room for homogeneous grouping of students by ability, but both plans should be used because in society, individuals interact with others regardless of ability but they also seek peers for interaction. A second \"scared cow\" is cooperative learning. Frequent assessment and evaluation are required to ensure that cooperative learning works as it should. Team teaching is a third idea that bears scrutiny. Many human relations problems may surface in team teaching, and it is important to allow for individual differences among instructors. A fourth concept that requires scrutiny is that of measurably stated  objectives. There are dangers in the rigidity of measurably stated objectives that may inhibit real learning and limit the focus of instruction. The final \"sacred cow\" is the notion of teaching everybody in the public schools. There are good reasons for excluding certain highly disruptive students from the regular classroom if their presence hampers the learning of other students. (SLD)",

During the study it quickly became apparent that the metaphors used to describe portfolios help elucidate how the profession perceives their appropriate use. In fact, the term \"portfolio\" is a metaphor educators have borrowed from artists. In some cases, the portfolio becomes a metaphor for statistical references. A second metaphor is the portfolio as tool, and another is the portfolio as conversation. At one school of education, portfolio use was well-established, and descriptions of portfolio use were very complete. At the second site, there was a strong focus on affective factors in learning, and there was  considerable uncertainty about the direction state requirements for accreditation would take. In many ways, at both schools, the portfolio became the context for learning how to interact professionally. Conceptualizing the portfolio as tool and as conversation were the metaphors most commonly found at both schools. The challenge for teacher preparation programs is to find ways of implementing the portfolio in ways that promote professional growth and program enhancement while maintaining conversations that are succinct and scintillating.

The study is contextualized in the longitudinal parallel ethnographies of the Identity and Learning Programme, a collaborative program that originated in two urban elementary schools in England that is influenced by theories of symbolic interactionism. The findings presented here relate to the assessment phase of the overall program and focus around a model of questions concerning social influences on assessment. Key aspects of the model are presented and illustrated with examples from the case study that informed it. The overall model and the analysis give rise to the  question of what is involved in a teacher &quot;knowing&quot; a child for assessment purposes. The case study of one pupil over the years of elementary school education illustrates the exploration of this question. (Contains 26 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"One set of approaches to the problem of clustering with dichotomous data in cluster analysis (CA) was studied. The techniques developed for clustering with binary data involve calculating distances between observations based on the variables and then applying one of the standard CA algorithms to these distances. One of the groups of distances that are designed for binary data is known collectively as matching coefficients. There are several incarnations of matching coefficients, but all take as their main goal the measurement of response similarity between any two observations. Thus, distance and similarity come to express the same concept with respect to the observations. This study examined four measures of association that are common to four previous studies. Using Monte Carlo  simulation, cluster analysis was conducted using the four distance measures. Under the conditions of this study, the four measures performed very much the same in terms of correctly classifying individuals into two clusters based on dichotomous variables. Another interesting result is that clustering solutions were virtually identical for samples of size 240 and 1,000. (Contains 6 tables, 6 figures, and 12 references.) (SLD)",

Kentucky and Maine were chosen for a case study. Four categories in the assessments of these states were compared with the same four categories of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). While there were close similarities between the corresponding categories, it was risky to make direct comparisons without understanding how the NAEP and state assessments defined performance standards and how each state arrived at its own proficiency category labels.  The percentage of students performing at or above high proficiency levels in the Maine and Kentucky assessments were not substantially different from the national assessment results. However, results were not entirely consistent across grades and years, a finding attributed to the fact that the definitions of performance standards and the methods of standard setting were different. The sizes of achievement gains from the state's own computations were greater than counterpart gains from the NAEP, something attributed to the high-stakes nature of the state assessments. These findings suggest that policymakers and educators need to become more aware of the uses and limitations of current national and state assessments as education information databases.

        "description":"Statistics anxiety, which is experienced by as many as 80% of graduate students, has been found to weaken performance in statistics and research methodology courses. This study examined the prevalence of procrastination on statistics assignments among graduate students and the relationship between academic procrastination and six dimensions of statistics anxiety. Participants were 135 graduate students enrolled in 3 sections of a required introductory-level educational research course at a southeastern university. Findings reveal that a high percentage of students reported problems with procrastination on writing term papers, studying for examinations, and completing weekly reading assignments. Overall academic procrastination was significantly positively related to the following  dimensions of statistics anxiety: interpretation anxiety, tests class anxiety and fear of asking for help. A canonical correlation analysis reveals that academic procrastination resulting from both fear of failure and task aversiveness was related significantly to the worth given to statistics, interpretation anxiety, test and class anxiety, computational self-concept, fear of asking for help, and fear of the statistics instructor. Implications for statistics anxiety reduction as a procrastination intervention are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 76 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Weinstein, D. Palmer, and A. Schulte, 1987) as proposed by S. Olejnik and S. Nist (1992), A. Olivarez and M. Tallent-Runnels (1994), B. Olaussen and I. Braten (1998), and the model that evolved from the exploratory factor analysis of the current data set. Data were from two samples, one of 319 college freshmen and the other of 2,535 college freshmen. The aim was not only to determine the model that best fits the data set, but also to investigate how replicable these models are with a large sample size. The model proposed by Olaussen and Braten appears to have the best fit to the  data of this study. The two-factor model that evolved from the exploratory factor analysis of the data did not adequately explain the data under the scrutiny of confirmatory factor analysis. This study supports the three latent structure model of the LASSI instrument. The second purpose of the study was to examine the reliability (internal consistency) of the 10 LASSI subscales. The results show that, in some subscales, the Cronbach alpha obtained from this study appear to be slightly better than the indices reported in the manual. Overall, the alpha coefficients obtained in this study reasonably matched those reported in the LASSI manual. (Contains 2 tables, 4 figures, and 16 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Item mappings are also used to construct ordered item booklets in the CTB/McGraw Hill Bookmark standard setting procedure. Selection rules for mapping the items vary with the purpose of the mapping. The objective of this paper is to categorize various types of item mappings, to describe ways to assess the consequences of a given item selection rule for mapping a binary item, and to provide a general empirical Bayes framework from which specific selection rules can be derived. A comparison is made on the maximum information (MI) rules and  those derived from an empirical Bayes (EB) approach. It is noted that the EB rules coincide with the MI rules if the correction for guessing formula is used to extend the EB rules for Rasch and two parameter logistic items to the EB rules for three parameter logistic items.

In previous studies, goal attributes such as positive-based incentive values had been found to be higher for intrinsic goals, mastery goals, and more difficult goals. Intrinsic goals and mastery goals were more positive-based than were extrinsic and performance goals unless goals were also perceived as difficult. College students (n=102) completed a booklet in which they rated academic goals in terms of several goal attributes, using a 7-point response scale. In this study, performance-approach goals differed from performance-avoidance goals in several types of incentive value, and contrasts between these two goal types appeared both to be  confounded with difficulty level and to interact with it. Results are consistent with goal orientation theories, but also suggest possible elaborations of those theories as new information is obtained about interactions among goal attributes. (Author/SLD)",

Because of inconsistencies in the collection and reporting of information about Latino youth, they are often counted as &quot;white,&quot; resulting in the under-reporting of confined minority group members. Data from a number of sources indicates that minority over-representation is generally a product of actions that occur at earlier points in the juvenile justice system. In 1998, African American youth were over-represented as a proportion of arrests in 26 of 29 offense categories documented by the Federal  Bureau of Investigation. White youth represented 66% of the juvenile court referral population, but they were only 53% of the detained population. African Americans made up 31% of the referred population, and 44% of the detained population. Minority youth were also over-represented in formal processing, waiver to adult court, and dispositions of out-of-home placement. It is expected that the cumulative disadvantage of minority youth will continue to spiral as states continue to pass more punitive laws allowing youth to be charged as adults. (SLD)",

        "description":"To assess the level of family stress that a child experiences, several questions from the National Survey of America's Families (NSAF) were combined to create a family stress index. The NSAF is a survey of more than 44,000 households representative of the United States as a whole and of 13 states, conducted as part of the Assessing the New Federalism project. The family stress index assigns one point for each of six stressful circumstances related to the inability to meet household expenses (including shelter and food), access to health care, and poor health. Children in families scoring two or higher on the index were categorized as living in stressful family environments. Findings indicate that half of children living in families with income below the federal poverty level also  lived in stressful family environments. Thirty-five percent of children in families with incomes between 100 and 150% of the federal poverty level lived in stressful family environments. In contrast, just 1 child in 20 of those families with incomes over 3 times the federal poverty limit lived in stressful family environments. Levels of stress also vary by parents' education and by family structure. Children living in single-parent families or cohabiting families were more than twice as likely as those living in married couple families to live in stressful family environments. There are striking differences across the states in the proportion of children living in stressful family environments, ranging from a low of 15% in Wisconsin to a high of 30% in California. Overall, just over one  in five children in the United States lives in a stressful family environment. Data suggest that children living in stressful family environments are nearly twice as likely to exhibit low levels of school engagement and are four times more likely to have high levels of behavioral and emotional problems.

Turbulence was associated with several types of change, including moves and multiple school changes. The NSAF is a survey of more than 44,000 families, representing a national sample and the populations of 13 states, conducted as part of the Assessing the New Federalism project. A child who experienced two or more of the defined changes during the prior 12 months was classified as experiencing turbulence. Nationwide in 1997, 6% of all children experienced turbulence as defined for this study. When children are compared by family income, welfare receipt, family structure, and parental education, it  becomes apparent that turbulence is much more prevalent in poor families than it is in moderate- or higher-income families. Fourteen percent of children in families that received Aid to Families with Dependent Children experienced high levels of turbulence in their lives. Nine percent of children who lived in one-parent families experienced turbulence, compared with 5% of children in two-parent families. Children who had experienced turbulence were also more likely than other children to have high levels of emotional and behavioral problems. There is considerable variation across states in the percentages of children who have experienced high levels of turbulence, with a high of 9% in Florida. Evidence from the NSAF indicates that turbulence is associated with poorer outcomes for  children. (Contains 1 table, 5 figures, and 22 references.) (SLD)",

The NSAF is a national survey of more than 44,000 families, conducted as part of the Assessing the New Federalism project.

Children who experienced three or more risks were classified as having a high level of sociodemographic risk. Nationally in 1997, 8% of children under age 18 experienced high levels of sociodemographic risk. Among the 13 states studied, the proportion of children experiencing high risk ranged from 3 to  17%. Risk factors tended to co-occur; children who experienced one stressful factor were likely to experience others. About half of poor children experienced poverty plus one other risk factor, and 5% experienced all the risk factors. Children who experience high levels of sociodemographic risk are substantially more likely than other children to suffer negative outcomes, such as emotional and behavioral problems and difficulties in school. Implications of NSAF findings for the study of high-risk children are discussed. (SLD)",

A taxonomic scheme was devised for examining the realities of what occurs in classrooms. The taxonomy identifies five dimensions of classroom life: (1) social/psychological relations; (2) technical core of instruction; (3) physical structure and organizational routines; (4) discipline and classroom management; and (5) attitudes, perceptions, and expectations. Protocols were obtained from classroom observations in 21 elementary classrooms, in which 52 observations yielded 150 hours of direct observation in grades 1 through 6. Thirty-seven students from these  classrooms participated in focus groups. Findings show the importance of the teachers' personality and early morning demeanor in setting classroom tone and the usefulness of group instruction in averting disciplinary problems. Also highlighted were the teachers' tone of voice and nonverbal forms of disciplinary and management techniques. Students in focus groups showed generally positive attitudes toward their teachers, and their responses demonstrated the importance of teachers' language and communication styles. Results also show that cultural themes associated with mainstream culture were more prevalent in the classrooms than cultural themes associated with Afro-cultural ideas. The results have implications for the development of a more extensive and inclusive effort to describe the  experience of low-income African American elementary school students.

The study began with the purpose of identifying the characteristics of exemplary teachers in low-income urban schools. As the research continued, it became apparent that the answer was straightforward--exemplary urban teachers are those who construct respectful and trusting relationships with students and their families. The paper illustrates the value of triangulating data collection to understand issues of teaching and learning in urban schools better. Being positive with children was the theme that dominated parent discussion, and parents appealed for good communication with their children's teachers.  Teachers agreed about the importance of parental involvement in children's education, and they knew that they were unsuccessful in this aspect of their teaching. Students spoke about basic issues of respect and comfort. Triangulating these data helped researchers build a description of the qualities of effective urban teachers. It was clear that a barrier existed between parents and teachers in this study. Caught in the middle of parent-teacher conflict, the students appreciated teachers who expressed interest in their lives. (Contains 29 references.) (SLD)",

As an emerging dimension of social stratification, legal status influences not only immigrants but also their children. Using data collected in Houston and San Diego, this study examines the intergenerational health consequences of undocumented status for child well-being. Results support the argument that children with undocumented immigrant parents suffer higher risks of poverty and poor health than children in legal households, and children in mixed-status households are equally disadvantaged despite having a legal parent. Children in legal households are wealthier and have more food, better living quarters, and better health insurance and health status. Drawbacks to being raised in  families with one or more unauthorized residents offer further evidence of a growing policy dilemma about access to health care and the general well-being of children. Addressing these needs carries particular significance for the future of a growing Chicano/a population, among whom research documents an observable health deficit. This deficit, which may also exist among other Latino groups experiencing high rates of undocumented migration and uncertain legal status outcomes, contributes to existing health disparities and racial and ethnic inequality in the United States.

It also provides evidence about the increasing importance of education to economic success among Hispanics in the new economy, highlighting the high-paying sector of information technology (IT). Significant findings include: the Hispanic population is a rapidly growing, increasingly important segment of the U.S. population; despite tangible evidence of improvements for some groups, there are lags in the educational attainment of Hispanics; the economic rewards of education are on the rise; the relatively low levels of Hispanic earnings are explained largely by lower levels of educational  attainment (earnings premiums associated with higher education are much the same for Hispanics as for non-Hispanics); and Hispanics are greatly under-represented in the high-paying IT sector, but in general those in IT occupations are successful. The IT case study illustrates that the consequences of underachievement in education are two-fold: students' future prosperity is harmed, and the economy at large will have fewer individuals prepared to contribute in new economy occupations.

        "description":"The move to lengthen school days with afterschool programs has support from Democrats and Republicans. Supporters of afterschool programs include child care professionals who believe young children need more supervision, educators who believe children need more academic instruction, and politicians who believe teens need more structured afterschool activities. Such beliefs reflect misunderstanding of important facts. Research indicates that only 2 percent of children aged 5-12 regularly care for themselves after school. Supply of afterschool programs far exceeds demand. Evidence does not support the contention that opening more afterschool programs will boost academic achievement or reduce delinquency. The Clinton administration's request to fund afterschool programs is only a  small part of a plan to expand the public school's role. Given the widely acknowledged failure of many government schools to accomplish their primary duty (to educate students), the administration's proposal for expanding the schools' responsibilities is inappropriate. Instead of funding the expansion of government schools, state legislators should adopt universal tuition tax credits that would give parents full latitude to select their children's schools, including independent schools, with or without afterschool programs. Finally, Congress should cease funding afterschool programs. (Contains 94 notes). (SM)",

It suggests that students learn more effectively when motivated, and hip-hop music is a tremendous motivating force for urban youth. It is also a legitimate voice of urban youth resistance and a viable literary genre worthy of serious academic contemplation. The first section shows how students are more inclined to develop literacy skills if they have a cultural frame, which will help them understand the material presented during instruction. The second section argues that rap music and urban youth are closely aligned, discussing the literary viability of rap texts, their worthiness for serious  academic study, and their ability to be used to scaffold complex literary concepts. The third section looks at a high school unit that was created to incorporate elements of popular culture as well as to facilitate the critical understanding of canonical literary texts. The fourth section initiates a discussion of the effectiveness of the unit, suggests possible strategies for interacting with the data, and brainstorms the implications of this information for future research.

Most research to date has focused on the elements and functions of classroom discourse and on adult-child or teacher-pupil conversations in educational settings. Little is known, however, about children's informal talk in which children themselves take on a leading conversational role. This paper examines a youth initiated conversation about sexual orientation, which emerged in an inner-city youth gardening program as a group of participants were busy harvesting crops. The macro-level analysis points to the kinds of positions voiced by the speakers, while the micro-level analysis examines the characteristics of the argumentation structure that emerged and its function  in the dialogue. The case is made that discourse is an important tool for the construction and deconstruction of meaning and self for inner city youth, and that youth need to be provided with more opportunities to contest issues of relevance to them such as sexual orientation.

Seventy-two Latina college freshmen completed measures of social anxiety and avoidance, gender role identity, and ethnic identity. Main effects of gender role identity and ethnic identity status emerged. Participants with androgynous gender role identities scored lower on both social anxiety and social avoidance than participants with undifferentiated, feminine, or masculine gender role identities. Also, achieved ethnic identity status and exploration ethnic identity status individuals scored lower on social anxiety and avoidance than their unexamined status counterparts. Findings are explained in terms of gender role  identity and ethnic identity development as probable protective factors during adolescence. (Contains 24 references.) (Author/SM)",

        "description":"This paper investigated whether educational reforms in England and Wales since 1988 have differentially affected schools serving socially disadvantaged communities, focusing on the impact of marketization and performance regulation in England. Data came from the Impact of Competition on Secondary Schools (ICOSS) project, a longitudinal study of the impact of competition on over 300 secondary schools. Data collection occurred from 1993-98 and included an administrative database, a mailed survey of teachers, interviews with headteachers, and case studies of three schools. Results are presented according to: how social and academic polarization between schools changed since 1992 and why; whether improved academic performance at the school level was more difficult to achieve for  schools with more socially disadvantaged students; whether marketization impacted schools with more socially disadvantaged students differently; and how student communities affected schools' improvement strategies and competitive responses. Results indicate that the proportion of socially disadvantaged students in a school community has had a negative impact on attracting resources and improving achievement, and the two factors are interrelated. Four appendixes present data on polarization, ICOSS survey responses on perceptions of competition, school budget adjustments, and additional multiple regressions. (Contains 37 references.) (SM)",

A look at these organizations and the young people they serve shows that CBOs offer a means of reaching at-risk youth, and that they can have a significant impact on the skills, attitudes, and experiences of young people. Surveys of CBO participants show that they express a sense of personal value, hopefulness, and agency far greater than peers in their communities, and even greater than the attitudes of youth growing up in more representative U.S. circumstances. Follow-up studies with more than 60 participants in youth CBOs show that the majority of these young people are firmly set on  positive pathways as workers, parents, and community members. Research reveals that effective CBOs are intentional learning environments. CBOs cannot be effective, however, without support from community members and other community organizations. Long-term and short-term strategies to promote involvement in CBOs are outlined. (SLD)",

        "description":"This digest, based on an extensive review of research on comprehensive school reform, presents a brief overview of the role of teachers in comprehensive schoolwide reform (CSR). CSR is most successful when schools have decision-making autonomy in administration and instruction. Teachers also prefer models that fit with the school's overall environment, staffing, and student population, and those that mesh with reforms already in progress. Teachers play a vital role in CSR implementation. Providing them with adequate resources for implementation and time for planning promotes their support. Some CSR models are very prescriptive, and provide curricula and assessments, while other models rely more on the school to develop materials that support the philosophy of the reform. Among  the factors that facilitate implementation of reform efforts by teachers include provision by the designers of a structured curriculum, concrete examples of instructional practices reflecting the reform, and specific, practical mechanisms for achieving the higher standards established as a goal.

Secada, and the recommendations of the Hispanic Dropout Project (U.S. Department of Education) for transforming bilingual education at all school levels. Several educational policies are necessary to promote effective bilingual education practices. Native Spanish-speaking students need to continue in a bilingual program until they have a solid linguistic foundation that enables their mastery of other academic subjects as well as English and Spanish. Schools need to convey the expectation that students will become literate in English and learn to high standards. Bilingual education  should be depoliticized, and the early tracking of limited English proficient students into low reading groups and other slow classes must be discontinued. Teacher training is essential to effective bilingual education programs. Some exemplary programs at high school, middle school, and elementary levels are identified, and the instructional strategies of these schools are discussed. Tutoring programs may provide valuable help for bilingual students, and two such programs are described. Components of effective bilingual programs are not all the same, but some universal principles emerge. Successful programs revise their approaches as new strategies are proven effective and new student needs are identified. Effective schools recognize the necessity of proficiency in both languages, and  they offer individualized instruction and other aids. Successful schools also maintain an atmosphere that supports the belief that all students are equally valuable and that they all will succeed. (SLD)",

Data from the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) database were used to analyze the influence of computers on academic achievement. The NAEP, which is administered in 4th, 8th, and 12th grade, provides test scores as well as background information on students, their teachers, and their school administrators. This analysis considered the effect of computers in the classroom by analyzing six factors: frequent in-class computer use by trained teachers; race and ethnicity; parents' educational attainment; number of reading materials in the home; free or reduced-price lunch participation; and gender. Results  indicate that students with at least weekly computer instruction by well-prepared teachers do not perform any better on the NAEP reading test than do students who have less or no computer instruction. Variables such as race, income, home environment, and parents' college attendance are all significant factors in explaining differences in reading test scores. Girls score slightly higher than boys on the NAEP reading exam in 4th and 8th grade. An appendix presents results of the statistical models. (SM)",

When he first arrived in 1970, Boston was segregated, and there were few black faculty members. He joined forces with a female professor who was concerned about the problems of women on campus, and established the first Affirmative Action Task Force there. They also established a Black Studies program within the department of Sociology. A few additional faculty and staff of color were hired, and an active Black Faculty and Staff caucus was organized. With pressure and assistance from this group, the first person of color was hired as Associate  Provost. The professor served on many campus committees to give a voice to the concerns of people of color. The William Monroe Trotter Institute was founded in the 1980s. It assumed leadership in conducting a balanced, objective assessment of the status of Black Americans. It also established a journal, the Trotter Review. By the 1980s, the number of racially diverse faculty members had grown significantly, as had the number of female faculty and staff. (SM)",

Negative stereotypes abound in the descriptions of urban youths in the professional and public press. Urban students sometimes even find that their positive characteristics, such as high educational aspirations, are seen as at-risk characteristics because they are incongruent with negative stereotypes. This situation may contribute to the gap between educational aspirations and achievement among urban  students of color. The Albany Institutes provide experiences that confirm the promotive characteristics of urban youth and their families and treat them as if they are gifted and talented. The curriculum and themes for each of the Institutes are the result of extensive community involvement. The Institutes themselves offer opportunities for students to participate in democratic decision making processes that promote their social responsibilities and enhance cognitive and moral development. The Institutes also offer prosocial peer group experiences. Evaluations of the Institutes indicate that students especially appreciate the teambuilding experiences and their relationships with mentors. (Contains 34 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"The current state of continuing vocational training in Central and Eastern European countries and its most important challenges were analyzed. The analysis found that the former continuing vocational training systems in these areas were characterized by generally low training levels and interdependence among the state-owned enterprises that financed and provided staff training. At present, the transitioning countries of Central Europe are aware of the increased need for continuing vocational training to accompany large-scale economic and social restructuring processes. Continuing vocational training is seen as a means to raise the competitiveness of companies in both national and international markets and to increase the employability of workers. However, reforms of the education  and training systems in Central and Eastern European countries since the early 1990s have frequently focused on institutions and programs belonging to the initial education and training area and on mainstream developments and students. All-embracing economic and social changes require new concepts and frameworks and a newly defined cooperation of key stakeholders in the system--needs not too different from those in Western Europe, even if reform needs are much more basic. (The report is based on individual country reports produced by national experts from Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia. Executive summaries of these country reports are included.)  (KC)",

A critical assumption underlining it is that much online instruction would be performed by faculty members who also teach, as part of their work load, traditional face-to-face classes. The format of the paper follows that of a journal kept in a graduate seminar. It contains reflections on course structure, content and materials, class interaction, assignments and grading, modes of presentation, quality issues for students and the instructor, and satisfaction. These conclusions are made: online students report greater \"community\"; face-to-face courses create a potentially coercive environment in which everyone must feel the potential for  manipulation and embarrassment; students in traditional classes expect the instructor to do all the work and resist class participation; and many external factors influence grading and the accurate assessment of students in a traditional classroom.

Introductory materials cover objectives and how to use the guide. Section 1, &quot;What Do We Mean by VI?&quot; compares preconceptions about VI with reality, describing different degrees of VI and introducing common eye conditions and their effect on the student's learning needs. Section 2, &quot;What Are the Implications for WES Field Staff/Branches?&quot; uses a case study approach that is based on a survey of WEA provision for visually impaired adult students. It follows a new student through the key stages involved in arriving at a WEA class and looks at ways in which the WEA  could have facilitated the journey. Section 3, &quot;What Does It Mean for the WEA Tutor?&quot; collects good practice suggestions from the survey, together with advice from experienced tutors and texts. Section 4, &quot;A Trainer's Perspective,&quot; outlines the structure and content of a successful course and provides tips on organizing a course. Each section concludes with suggestions for practical tasks to improve the user's knowledge of VI and to assess the quality of policy and practice in provision for visually impaired students. Section 5 contains resources referred to in the main text that are also suitable for use by field staff/branches for tutor training courses or by tutors as performance aids as they apply their learning on the job.

Section 6 looks into the impact of extracurricular activities on the literacy levels of Ontario's youth. Section 7 addresses consequences of low literacy among youth. Section 8 identifies the main conclusions, including the following: (1) Ontario youth have better literacy skills than older  Ontarians; (2) the rate of Ontario youth who exceed level 2 in document literacy is about the same as the national average; (3) relative to the national average, Ontario's youth skills are weaker in prose and quantitative literacy; (4) the strongest determinant of youth literacy is the individual's level of education, the second strongest is the mother's education; (5) activities with the strongest positive effect on the document literacy score are attending or participating in sports, using public libraries, taking courses, attending movies, plays, or concerts at least monthly, and limiting time spent watching television; and (6) literacy has an economic payoff.

        "description":"Max was one of the boys who went to the St. Kilda Police and Citizens Youth Club every week. He was often in minor scrapes, but nothing serious. When he was 20, he was conscripted into the Australian army and sent to fight in Vietnam, leaving behind his new wife and baby son. Like most of the nearly 50,000 primarily working class Australians in the war, Max knew little about the history or politics of Vietnam. His father, who had fought in World War II, thought it would &quot;make a man of him.&quot; Max returned from his tour of duty physically unharmed, but in the words of his aunt &quot;a bundle of nerves.&quot; When he discovered his wife was having an affair with his old friend, he took action that had serious consequences. He shot out the windows in his house; his pregnant wife took their son  and left; and he was sent to prison for three years. After he was released, he spent years traveling and taking odd jobs. He settled on a job in a service station. Through his ex-wife's sister-in-law, Max was reunited with his son and the daughter he had never seen. Because of a back injury, he decided to take a course at the Technical and Further Education college where he developed a relationship with a fellow student. (This high interest, low vocabulary book's appendixes include a glossary, short history of the Vietnam War, and a timeline.) (YLB)",

The study combines contextual analysis of secondary data about education and training providers with a regional study of several generations of families in South Wales via survey, semi-structured interviews, and taped oral histories. This paper describes the provision of formal education and training in Wales during the period covered by the study, 1996-97, focusing where possible on these three research sites--Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, and Neath Port Talbot.  Specific topics are schools in Wales; the growth of initial education; bilingualism and territoriality; performance measures for initial education; pre-war adult education and training; whether a post-war learning society has existed; and performance measures for adult education. Appendixes include figures that detail educational participation and outcomes, further and higher education students in Wales, and destination of school leavers. Contains 73 references. (YLB)",

It examines the notion of a learning society in Britain, suggesting that markedly different interpretations of the term are in common use among politicians, economists, policymakers, and educationalists. The paper outlines chief arguments currently being used to advocate the establishment of a learning society in Britain. These arguments have two strands--the claim that the standard of education and training in a country has a direct impact on its economy and that,  therefore, expenditure on learning by the state and employers will be recouped, and the claim that there is a lack of justice in the distribution of education and its rewards in Britain today. Since this involves a brief description of the availability of education and training in Britain, the paper allows a preliminary consideration of the extent to which a learning society already exists or can be said to have existed in the past. It concludes that to some extent the &quot;learning society&quot; is used as a term of convenience. Appendixes include definitions and acronyms.  Contains 103 references. (YLB)",

Discussion begins with an examination of the way in which the official discourse of the learning society is dominated by a particular social theory of lifelong learning, called human capital theory. It demonstrates that human capital theory involves an unwarranted abstraction of economic behavior from social relations more widely, maintaining that participation in lifetime learning cannot be understood in terms of the narrow calculation of utility maximization. This  critique provides the basis for the development of the lineaments of a theoretical account in which learning behavior is conceived as the product of individual calculation and active choice, but within parameters set by both access to learning opportunities and collective norms--parameters that vary systematically over space and time so that place and history must accordingly play a central role in any adequate theorization. The paper concludes that this kind of theoretical approach has important implications for empirical research and strategies aimed at creating a learning society.

This paper describes the notion of learning trajectories and considers determinants of an individual's participation in education or training. It discusses a door-to-door survey of 1,104 householders in industrial South Wales to obtain their life work and educational histories that were analyzed to identify trajectories--characteristic patterns of participation and non-participation in post-compulsory education and training. These 5 categories with 11 trajectories  are identified: disaffected learner (non-learner, near non-learner); delayed learner (delayed learner, deferred student, twilight learners); transitional learner (false-start trainee, false-start student); immature learner (still at school, still in full-time education); and lifetime learner (work-based learner, early learner). The analysis that led to determination of six predictor variables--area of residence, gender, type of school, attempting qualifications, qualification at age 16, and occupational class of father--is explained. Appendixes include development of learning trajectories. Contains 57 references. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study compared the GCSE benchmarks of all local education authorities (LEAs) in England and Wales. The impetus was that a comparison on almost any performance indicator of initial education flattered England, and comparisons led to the conclusion that the education system in Wales was failing. The performance measure was the GCSE benchmark of the percentage of the relevant age cohort gaining five or more grades A-C; the 1994 figure was lower for Wales. Independent variables used to characterize LEAs were social class, free school meals, population, area, and population density. Correlations between data were calculated using Pearson's r; a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted. All independent variables correlated significantly with the GCSE benchmark, with the  percentage taking free school meals accounting for two-thirds of the variance in results between LEAs. No evidence was found of poor school performance in Wales. The initial schooling and background characteristics of each participant were used to create a series of logistic regression models to analyze post-compulsory learning trajectories. Nine predictor variables at age 15 or less were significant in predicting examination results at 16; interactions between variables were more significant in many cases. The type of secondary school attended was the major determinant of qualifications at age 16 until fairly recently. (Contains a 53-item bibliography.) (YLB)",
