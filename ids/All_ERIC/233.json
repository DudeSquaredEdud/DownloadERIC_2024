        "description":"Over the years, globalization has benefitted education in many aspects. This study aims to understand the students' perceptions and expectations of virtual faculty exchange programs conducted in higher learning institutions from the Philippines and Indonesia. This study utilized descriptive research to describe the undergraduate students' perceptions on the instructional aspect of the virtual faculty exchange program and their expectations to provide a basis for improving the quality of the activity in the future. This study was participated by seventy-seven (77) undergraduate students taking up computing courses from the Philippines and Indonesia during the second semester of Academic Year 2020-2021. Results revealed that the student's perception of the quality of the instructions received from both universities was &quot;Very Good&quot; (WM = 4.41), indicating that students were excited and looked forward to learning many things in the virtual faculty exchange program. Moreover, the expectations of the students showed that student-respondents had expectations relating to improving themselves, learning new things from foreign instructors, cultural and international experience, the personality of the instructors, and self-expression. In conclusion, the findings of this study provide a basis for improving the quality of delivering instruction for the virtual faculty exchange program.",

        "author":["Jackson-Hammond, Cynthia"],
        "description":"Recent Florida legislation (SPB 7044) should be viewed with much concern and with skepticism as to the intent of the bill and its unintended consequences. The bill requires state colleges and universities to seek reaffirmation from different accrediting organizations at the end of each review cycle. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the U.S. Department of Education have expressed concerns to the Florida legislature and identified major problems that could result from this type of action. The SPB 7044 bill has unintended consequences for Florida higher education and undermines the purpose of accreditation and the guarantee that Florida students, parents and families are receiving quality academic experiences provided by quality Florida institutions.",

        "author":["Nyairo, Franklin"],
        "description":"Communication, the flow of ideas and information between individuals in a social context, is the heart of educational experience. Constructivism and constructivist theories form the foundation for the collaborative learning processes of creating and sharing meaning in online educational contexts. The Learning and Collaboration in Technology-enhanced Contexts (LeCoTec) course comprised of 66 participants drawn from four European universities (Oulu, Turku, Ghent and Ramon Llull). These participants were split into 15 groups with the express aim of learning about computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). The Community of Inquiry model (social, cognitive and teaching presences) provided the content and tools for learning and researching the collaborative interactions in this environment. The sampled comments from the collaborative phase were collected and analyzed at chain-level and group-level, with the aim of identifying the various message types that sustained high learning outcomes. Furthermore, the Social Network Analysis helped to view the density of whole group interactions, as well as the popular and active members within the highly collaborating groups. It was observed that long chains occur in groups having high quality outcomes. These chains were also characterized by Social, Interactivity, Administrative and Content comment-types. In addition, high outcomes were realized from the high interactive cases and high-density groups. In low interactive groups, commenting patterned around the one or two central group members. In conclusion, future online environments should support high-order learning and develop greater metacognition and self-regulation. Moreover, such an environment, with a wide variety of problem solving tools, would enhance interactivity.",

        "title":"Finnish EFL Teachers&apos; Attitudes towards Using Computer-Assisted Language Learning Tools",
        "author":["Nyairo, Franklin"],
        "description":"Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) is an emerging field of research that focusses on how information and communication technologies (ICT) are applied in language teaching and learning. CALL lies at the intersection of several other independent fields of study, i.e. technology, education, and linguistics. The aim of this study is to investigate Finnish EFL teachers' attitudes and perceptions towards using CALL tools in their classrooms. First, the study presents an overview of the CALL tools that the teachers use in their EFL instruction. Then, it explores the teachers' reasons behind choosing the said tools. Lastly, this study presents the teachers' own experiences on the benefits and potential these tools hold in the Finnish comprehensive and upper secondary schools. This study traces the roots and development of the field of CALL and its implications to the theory and practice of technology-enhanced language learning. Evidently, the benefits of using CALL are not limited to the teachers and students but also extend to the other stakeholders in the learning enterprise. For instance, technologies help motivate learners, and promote novel instructional and assessment practices. The study was conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods in the data collection and analysis. The advantage of using dual instruments of survey and interview helped delve deeper into the subject matter to discover answers to the research problem. With an online survey, the study contacted 687 EFL teachers in Finnish comprehensive and upper secondary school and received 91 respondents. In addition, the study purposively selected four teachers for in-depth interviews. The data was analyzed and presented using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. The findings from this study confirm that the use of ICTs in language learning settings continues to grow. In essence, EFL teachers extensively use a variety of CALL tools based on the perceived usefulness and effectiveness in a learning activity. The popular tools are computer applications (word processing) and web resources (audio and video), while mobile applications and social media are rarely used. Secondly, EFL teachers view technologies as complementary tools for instruction, assessment and learning motivation. In most cases, they are confident about integrating the tools in their teaching and learning activities. Furthermore, the teachers hope for more resources and ICT training and support in order to effectively and efficiently use the CALL tools on a wider scale. In conclusion, further research would help establish how teachers have been trained to incorporate technologies in their instructional methodologies and also, there is a need to assess which technologies have a greater impact on attainment of learning objectives.",

Specifically, the feelings towards learning programming and the challenges and difficulties encountered by IT students were determined. The researcher used a phenomenological approach to determine the commonality of lived experiences among the students. The study was conducted during the second semester of Academic Year 2020-2021. The participants were first-year students enrolled in a computer programming I course. Open-ended questions were employed to gather responses. Since the data gathering happened during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, the researcher used Google Form to collect responses. Participants were informed that the responses gathered were treated with the utmost confidentiality, security, and anonymity, following ethical research guidelines. Results revealed that participants have both positive and negative views about learning programming. As to the feelings towards learning computer programming, analysis shows that positive emotions include excitement and good happy feelings towards writing programs and finding them fun, challenging, and engaging. Negative feelings include being nervous, anxious, confused, and having difficulty learning how to write programs because it is hard. The challenges and problems encountered by IT students include difficulties relating to the program's syntax, errors and debugging processes; lesson-related; algorithm, analysis, resources, teaching, time-management, and personal factors. The researcher suggests recommendations that would improve the quality of teaching computer programming and offer new possible topics for future studies.",

However, this problem space spans enormous variations in both videos and questions. We discuss methods for creating and characterizing social VQA datasets, including: (1) crowdsourcing versus in-house authoring, including sample comparisons of two new datasets that we created (TinySocial-Crowd and TinySocial-InHouse) and the previously existing Social-IQ dataset; (2) a new rubric for characterizing the difficulty and content of a given video; and (3) a new rubric for characterizing question types. We close by describing how having well-characterized social VQA datasets will enhance the explainability of AI agents and can also inform assessments and educational interventions for people.",

Specifically, it evaluates the content, teaching and learning, support and feedback, and assessment variables through student perspectives. It also seeks to understand the views of the students on what they like the most about the learning modules as a basis for continuous improvement. A descriptive research design was utilized to give a quantitative or numeric depiction of trends, attitudes, or views of that group. The instrument was based on a university modules evaluation questionnaire. It was modified to suit the context of the study. The questionnaire was composed of the following variables: content, teaching and learning, support, and feedback and assessment. The instrument was subjected to face validity, content validity, and reliability analysis. The frequency distribution, percentage distribution, and weighted mean were used to calculate the level of agreement and satisfaction. The findings suggest that students were very satisfied with the content, teaching and learning, support, feedback, and assessment utilized in the learning modules for Application Development and Emerging Technologies course. The results further highlight some essential insights from the respondents that instructors may consider when improving the instructional material. It can be concluded that students were very satisfied with the learning modules used for the Application Development and Emerging Technologies course. Further, the following considerations may be reviewed for future improvement of the learning material: ensuring that the contents are complete, informative, interesting, organized, and detailed; ensuring that the contents are relevant to the course, easy to understand, and valuable; challenging, inexpensive, and accessible, allowing students to develop and acquire a new set of knowledge and skills; assessment tasks that can be challenging but fun to execute, and allowing the students to increase interest in reading the contents of the learning modules.",

Of the study sample, 1736 were girls (49.9%) and 1747 were boys (50.1%). All the children were from high SES families and attending private preschools in 10 cities in Turkey. The results showed that all peer relations variables were statistically significantly correlated with self-regulation skills of the children. Simple linear regressions analyses showed that self-regulation was statistically significant predictor of all peer relation variables (prosocial behaviours, aggressive behaviours, asocial behaviours, exclusion by peers, hyperactivity-distractibility, and fear-anxiety). Self-regulation explains the greatest variation in hyperactivity-distractibility of the children (15%) and the least variation in asocial behaviour (%3). This study shows that self-regulation in early childhood may lead to problems in peer relations. Problems with peers have long-term effects on children's development and mental health. This finding underlines the importance of promoting self-regulation skills in early years.",

        "author":["Guzar, Katlyn"],
        "description":"This qualitative case study was designed to explore how student services leaders adapted their leadership behaviors and practices in response to moving to the virtual working environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The case study site was a midsized university in southwestern Ontario. The data collected for the study came from three sources: interviews, questionnaires, and documentation. Study participants were leaders of teams that delivered student services, including a vice president, associate vice presidents, directors, and managers. Four themes were revealed from the results that reflected the changes leaders made in response to moving their team to the virtual working environment: reimagining communication, reconstructing work using technology, reframing team support, and reorienting toward hybrid work. This included changing the ways they communicated with their teams (e.g., modality and frequency), updating processes for service delivery and work within the team to suit the virtual modality, and an emphasis on team support to suit the new needs of the team that resulted from the stresses of the pandemic as well as working physically apart from each other. At the time of the study, teams were moving forward to work in a hybrid capacity. Leaders shared how much of what they changed to suit the virtual-only environment has continued but some nuanced challenges have emerged. More research is recommended to study hybrid work teams, specifically, additional research would be beneficial regarding work conventions and communication practices in hybrid teams.",

It requires ways of doing beyond regularised structures of humanist epistemology, ontology, and methodology. This article endeavours to describe my introduction to posthumansism and unplanned discovering of postqualitative inquiry through learning by doing. My (brief) journey with postqualitative inquiry has followed unexpected pathways, filtered through porous boundaries and discovered unheard voices in in-between spaces. This allows PQI to become more than knowledge-making. It is also a pedagogical and onto-epistemological venture and a rich, sensory and startling adventure of discovery into the entanglement of the social and the material.

        "description":"Due to recent unrest around the world, the number of refugees has increased dramatically in the last decade. In order to meet the needs of this population, host countries have had to quickly adapt to provide these refugees with basic needs. One such need is to have quality education for refugee children. The aim of this paper is to compare the policies of educational inclusion in Germany and Turkey that have accepted a large influx of refugees. Our findings suggest that both the German city-state of Hamburg and Turkey have made major strides over the past ten years to accommodate and provide for refugee children's educational needs. We list some of the policies that have led to greater inclusion and accessibility for refugee children in mainstream education. Key findings from the comparative document analysis show that although the two countries are distinguished by different levels of income and development, both have similarities in terms of (1) providing compulsory education for all children, (2) the delay in preparing and applying policy-based legislations for refugee education, and (3) the main activities such as additional language support and teacher training for the purpose of social inclusion of refugee students. Furthermore, both countries have had similar challenges such as the necessity of improvements in second language instruction and teacher training, thus highlighting the need for refugee education-oriented global solutions for the host countries. We recommend continued efforts to include multiculturally rich school curriculums to create educational settings that feel inclusive and comfortable for refugee children.

        "description":"Educational reforms come and go; teachers transcend. Teachers shape lives in whatever context they live. The teacher is the one constant, necessary but not sufficient element in the educational process. For teachers to deliver excellent performance, with equity, in the classroom, they must receive sufficient, excellent treatment with equity in their roles in society. They cannot be expected to give what they do not receive. Some countries highly esteem their teachers, with salaries and opportunities to match, for example, Singapore and Finland. The outcomes are observed in the quality of life in those societies. These concepts can apply to any culture, as we are speaking of basic, universal needs and reactions of human beings. The perspective of this study is local, yet global, in that we study individual countries' situations, touching on their social, economic, and educational aspects, but keeping in mind the commonalities of human nature globally. The aim of this paper is to prove that kind and caring action, beginning with teachers and the education system will result in an upward cycle of more such actions throughout society. Methodological approach is mixed. Qualitative research draws on secondary data in the form of a literature review of two case studies: Singapore and Finland. Quantitative data from the educational systems of both case study countries informs the analysis. The significance of this study is the potential societal paradigm shift which could come about by moving the pivotal fulcrum of socioeconomic balance even slightly in favor of our teachers.

The relevant documents were analysed by employing content analysis. The structure for teaching in the national education system organises and formulates the framework for education in the applicable countries. The study aimed to identify differences and similarities regarding the following elements of the structure for teaching. The elements foci were educational levels and the medium of instruction. One of the aims was to enhance the structure for teaching and learning in the BRICS countries. This research forms part of a larger BRICS project that compares the four components of the education systems and its elements as well as the internal and external determinates of the BRICS member states.

The paper has explored music preferences of preschool children for classical music and &quot;world music.&quot; As a part of the research, a general data questionnaire and music preferences questionnaire were used. The research was conducted in Split, Croatia, on a sample of 126 children of early and preschool age children -- three to six years old. The results show that there was no difference in children's music preferences with regard to age. Furthermore, no difference was found in children's music preferences with regard to gender. The obtained results have significant musical-pedagogical implications for the organization and conception of musical activities during early and preschool education. Musical contents for listening to music and singing can include various examples of &quot;world music.&quot; In this way, children will develop intercultural competencies from the earliest days.

        "description":"The paper focuses on the influence of technology on communication between teachers and parents through electronic diaries. Theoretically, the paper is based on action-network theory and its understanding that non-human and human actors build a network of relationships. By using a qualitative research approach, including interviews with principals, teachers, and creators of the e-diaries, as well as focus groups with parents and students in several Bulgarian schools, opinions of the different stakeholders are explored in depth. The results show that communication is lacking or is really rare through electronic diaries or it can be one-sided, without the parents' possibility to reply to teachers. It is argued that the level of participation of parents in the educational process is low. Most parents and teachers do not really see the need to be more involved or to communicate through the diaries. If educational reforms and especially measures to increase parents' level of involvement are to be undertaken, they should take into consideration parents' understanding of the educational process and their views on how they could be more actively involved and how they could contribute to the overall change in the educational system and a more effective teaching and learning process.

        "description":"Having reviewed several pieces of strategy documents, policy papers, and literature, we concluded that there is no uniform definition of either institutional autonomy or academic freedom (AF). Many different points of view determine the interpretation of these terms. Furthermore, the policymakers (e.g., governments, legislators) can ignore the theories connecting to autonomy and AF and separate from them the legislation-level realization. This paper aims to overview different interpretations of autonomy and AF, highlighting the most important standpoints and presenting how autonomy and AF are realized in the national legislation. Considering the limited length of this paper, we focus on our respective countries, namely Hungary and South Africa. Our previous findings show that in many aspects, our countries face similar challenges despite the different historical antecedents. In previous research we compared the factors, which can influence research activities, however, we did not investigate the legislative framework. To that end, in this paper, we go further and look specifically at legal frameworks within our respective countries. Our results illustrate that without a homogenous content, the State may use the concepts of autonomy and AF in its legislation as it sees fit. This in turn may lead to autonomy and AF or some of their components, while being formally safeguarded, they may lose the guarantee character that corresponds to their actual content.

        "description":"School reform policy in post-colonial societies is often guided by Euro-American theory from the North. Theory generated in the South is marginalised as backward and unscientific. The present study, couched within the Southern Theory framework, disrupts the hegemony of Northern Theory by examining the implementation of the indigenous philosophy of Ubuntu in post-colonial Southern Africa. Ubuntu advocates for collective responsibility, sharing, humility and love for humanity -- over selfish individualism. Employing critical discourse analysis, this qualitative desktop study reviews the implementation of Ubuntu as a reform policy to decolonise the school curriculum in Lesotho, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Findings indicate that curriculum reform policy is unequivocal in championing Ubuntu as the overarching philosophy for school reform. Although some aspects of Ubuntu are reflected in subject content and classroom pedagogy, a disturbing policy-practice gap was observed in existing literature. Some teachers in Lesotho, Zimbabwe and South Africa lack knowledge and values of Ubuntu. They are ill-prepared to promote this indigenous culture in their practice and do not show compassion and respect for learners. Some male teachers engage in illicit sexual relations with learners. To foster a decolonised Ubuntu-centred curriculum, teachers need knowledge on the selfless values of Ubuntu and how to nurture participatory democracy, respect, and love for humanity in their classrooms.

Since 2000, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) have aligned with SDG 4.3 by developing higher education institutions (HEIs) which aims to &quot;By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university&quot;. This was intended to create equal opportunities and permit full realisation and prosperity of human rights and human dignity. This paper explores the effectiveness of managing racial integration in BRICS HEIs and illustrates remarkable progress in research and policy enactment. Particular attention is devoted to the period from the mid-2000s when evidence around the globe exposed the presence of many forms of violence, which inhibit management of effective racial integration. Based on case studies from selected BRICS countries (South Africa, Russia, and Brazil), this paper explores how the management of racial integration is being addressed within these contexts.

        "description":"South Africa must embark upon the third epoch of education policy after the failures of the first two epochs: the 1953-1994 (&quot;apartheid&quot;) era and the 1994-2021 era (the dawn of democracy and the dismantling of apartheid structures). There were not enough education opportunities to guide all the children of the country to maturity and acceptance of their civilian responsibilities. This paper examines the reasons why the education policies of the first two epochs failed and contributed to a poor, unequal and ineffective school education system. The paper also explores the challenges that the education system needs to confront to create a new education system that will support the attainment of the hitherto unfulfilled expectations and dreams that its citizens carried into the democratic era. The education policy of the third epoch must address critical issues to chart the way to an effective education system. There is a need to reorganize (reset) the education system in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A streamlined curriculum needs to focus on the essential skills and knowledge the country needs. The system can no longer ignore the need for the adequate provision of vocational and technical education to alleviate the sharply rising unemployment rate of young people and support the growth of the economy. Quality education policy must function despite the lack of funds for the provision of appropriate and functional infrastructure and competent human resources.

        "description":"Generally, project monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) are mandatory actions throughout the project planning, implementation and conclusion phases. Although the terms &quot;monitoring&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; go together, evaluation is usually conducted after the project is completed and is typically included as part of the project report, while monitoring is a continuous process of ongoing data collection and feedback. This aspect is often neglected. Although M&amp;E guidelines for practitioners are in abundance, and advocacy for the use of specific models of M&amp;E are aplenty, there is a deficit of scholarly publications on M&amp;E of capacity development projects in higher education in particular. Furthermore, research guiding future M&amp;E endeavours based on lessons learnt before and during the pandemic, is found wanting. The three authors, in different roles, are part of an Erasmus+ co-funded project that aims to build capacity for curriculum transformation through internationalisation and development of Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL). COIL is an inclusive approach to provide all students with virtual internationalised learning experiences without having to travel. Taking an insiders' perspective and sharing our experiences in this project, this paper should inform future M&amp;E of capacity building projects.

        "description":"After PISA 2009, Shanghai education has received unprecedented attention from home and aboard. The government in Shanghai summed up the successful experience and launched the New High-Quality Schools (NHQS) project as a response. Under the policy background of promoting high-quality and equitable compulsory education in China, the NHQS project undertook the unique task of creating high-quality educational resources. The project is not only an honorary certification for the project schools, but also an organized small-scale school improvement plan. Compared with the National Blue-Ribbon Schools (NBRS) program in the United States, both projects encourage schools to create high-quality education from a bottom-up approach and provide a platform for excellent schools to share experiences. The distinctive features in the NHQS project are that it emphasizes the indispensable importance of quality with equity, and is more guided by the government. The &quot;Green Indicators&quot; used in the NHQS project go beyond a single criterion of student achievement in the past. However, as the overall assessment system in China has not changed, such small-scale attempts are still facing many difficulties. [For the complete Volume 20 proceedings, see ED622631.]",

Only one university in South Africa offers Physical Education as a comprehensive module in the distance education mode. The aim of this study was thus to investigate education students' and lecturers' positive and negative experiences of the effectiveness of Physical Education teacher training in distance education mode at a university in South Africa. Underpinned by Moore's Theory of Transactional Distance (TTD) (1983), data were collected by means of semi-structured, individual interviews with four lecturers and open-ended questionnaires with 17 students in a Physical Education distance education module. The five themes that emanated from the data analysis, were: interaction between students and lecturers; competence, passion and enthusiasm to teach Physical Education; obstacles with regard to Physical Education in distance learning; experiences with regard to practical training in Physical Education; and the content of the Physical Education program and students' perceptions of Physical Education. From the findings of positive and negative experiences of Physical Education in distance education mode, recommendations are made for Physical Education teacher training in distance education mode, for example, additional face-to-face contact opportunities, additional technological training, the enhanced use of student-interaction functions in learning management systems and sufficient management and administration systems at universities.

        "description":"A new epoch for humankind has started in most, if not all sectors of life, including the education sector. The question that seeks to be answered is whether the new period that started with the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic, often referred to as the &quot;new normal&quot;, is and will be characterised by less favourable education conditions or not. This paper explores a number of external disruptions, some associated with the pandemic, as possible catalysts towards an improved higher education system. Simultaneously, the function and necessity of internal disruption towards student mobility sustained innovation is considered. Despite the often-hostile nature of disruption, it can lead to much-needed or long-awaited innovation. The disruptive forces discussed are firstly alternative modes of delivery of university programmes, and secondly the mobility of foreign students. Thirdly, the value of microcredentialing as significant disruptive force for traditional universities necessitates a paradigm shift for policymakers. Within the context of a higher education institution, it can be predicted that all three of these possible innovations will be met with some level of resistance, despite the magnitude of the external force. These organisations will therefore need change drivers from within their ranks to create some kind of internal disruption towards the improvement of institution and the higher education sector as a whole.

Despite huge government investment in education aimed at building human capital countries within the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region continues to face low economic growth. This conceptual paper thus investigates the relationship between education, human capital formation and economic growth in SSA. Findings from the theoretical and empirical analysis reveal that education in SSA countries seems to make an insignificant contribution to human capital formation and economic growth jointly. In conclusion, the economic development variations observed across countries might be an indication of the need for a context-based human capital-based education approaches to strengthen economic growth within SSA countries. The study recommends that educational approaches that strengthen human capital creation should be adopted to promote economic growth in SSA countries.

        "description":"The purpose of this qualitative paper is to explore Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) centre managers' understanding of instructional leadership. Leadership skills are sometimes developed on the job. However, instructional leadership requires vision, a sound managerial style, relevant knowledge, skills, organisational acumen, and self-development. While these skills fall under management rather than leadership, Early Childhood Care and Education centre leaders in rural areas must still ensure that their centres function smoothly. Due to the minimal research conducted on the Early Childhood Care and Education centre managers' understanding of instructional leadership of rural ECCE centres in South Africa, the study aims to highlight the challenges, knowledge, practices and support provided to ensuring instructional leadership is achieved in the centres. A qualitative research approach was conducted in the Early Childhood Care and Education centres in the Black settlement areas of the Gauteng Province. Five centre managers were purposively selected from five rural community settings and interviewed using face-to-face semi-structured interviews to generate data. Data were thematically analysed to get themes and subthemes. Findings reveal that Early Childhood Care and Education centre managers' understanding of instructional leadership was constrained by uneven funding, lack of support and training in ECCE centre management. The conclusion is that most managers rely on untrained, poorly remunerated practitioners for the daily operations in the centre. For Early Childhood Care and Education centres to be well managed for sustainable development, well-trained, informed, visionary, experienced, and critical-thinking leaders and practitioners are needed. The study may be helpful to centre managers, policy-makers and other stakeholders. [For the complete Volume 20 proceedings, see ED622631.]",

        "author":["Karras, Konstantinos"],
        "description":"As a nation strives to meet the challenges posed by globalization, which is an issue of the information economy, its strength relies heavily on its citizens' intellectual prowess and critical thinking skills. Thus, institutions of teacher education play a key role in producing teachers who will be able to meet the needs of the time, with empathy, while promoting critical thinking, creative ability and the value system as a priority. Educating teachers to incorporate soft skills is critical for the profession's success. The term 'soft skills' refers to a wide range of personal and interpersonal attributes that are aimed at transforming the individual as well as society as a whole (Apple, 1996). The purpose of this research is to highlight the degree of preparation of future teachers in four large primary education universities in respective European countries. To achieve this, a mixed-mode technique was used by the researcher (questionnaires and semi-structured interviews) to gather information. The target group came from the teaching staff at the faculties of education in four European countries (Spain, Romania, France and Greece). Ten academics from each nation were handpicked to participate in face-to-face interviews. At the same time, the teaching staff of the teacher training departments participated in a focus group, in groups of 5 people each. The most crucial soft skills in their teaching profession were identified to be social skills. [For the complete Volume 20 proceedings, see ED622631.]",

        "author":["Sakarski, Gergana"],
        "description":"The theory and the practice of home-schooling has adherents and opponents, but the research data shows that this phenomenon has increased significantly over the past years in many countries and in different regions around the world. A growing interest from families willing to home-school their children is also observed in Bulgaria. This paper aims to explore the home-schooling landscape in Bulgaria, including the legal framework and most common practices, and to analyze some of the results of home-schooling for selected Bulgarian families, who have made this choice. There is little scholarly research and official data on elective home education in Bulgaria and this paper provides an overview of this alternative education practice through a study of the available literature, legislation texts and analysis of in-depth interviews conducted with home-schoolers aged over 16 years. Despite the fact that home education generally meets a certain level of reluctance, the legislation in Bulgaria has evolved in the past years and allows families to home-school their children through an independent form of education, under the oversight of the government. Home-schooling in Bulgaria is a quite recent phenomenon. A small number of individuals have now finished their home education and have either joined a higher education institution or the job market directly. Evidence from the conducted interviews shows that these Bulgarian home-schoolers thrive and perform well, not only in their respective studies and/or jobs, but also in the society in general.

One of the key challenges that school principals are facing in many parts of the world today is how to maintain a balance between professional discretion and accountability with the legislative and policy framework in which they must perform their duties. Every judgement call made by a principal will inevitably be questioned. However, without discretionary powers it would be impossible to be a principal. This paper therefore explores the application of professional discretion by school principals by focusing on different components of professional discretion, principals' need for autonomy, discretionary power of principals, principles governing the application of professional discretion, and the factors that influence or limit discretion.

With the passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015, much of the responsibility around education measures, outcomes, and priorities returned to state leaders. ESSA asks states to innovate and use evidence to inform the policies and practices that support education equity and excellence. As states implement the law this year, their legislation is clearly reflecting these new responsibilities and opportunities for flexibility. Interestingly, this mile-marking year's education data legislation is defined by both ESSA-powered innovation and a return to the more foundational data linking and governance activities that underlie states' abilities to achieve these more complex and innovative goals. This summary and analysis highlights key trends and innovative bills that policymakers, advocates, and the public need to know about, as well as a look ahead to 2018.

Student data (e.g., demographics, transcripts, attendance, test scores, outcomes, etc.) are an important tool for policymakers, educators, and families as they seek ways to support students and improve education experiences and pathways. Safeguarding data is a critical component of effective data use, and this complex and critical issue has continued to evolve over the last year. The student data privacy bills introduced in 2015 reflect both continued and newly developing student data privacy conversations in states and at the federal level. &quot;Student Data Privacy Legislation: What Happened in 2015, and What Is Next?&quot; summarizes the legislative activity around student data privacy in 2015.

        "description":"Over the past decade, states have made enormous progress in collecting, using, and reporting education data in service of learning--although state legislation has primarily focused on implementing the robust privacy and security protections and data governance structures that make data use safe. In the 2017 legislative session, data privacy continued to be a focus with more than half (93 of 183) of the state bills that were considered on education data addressing the issue. But 2017 also saw states increasingly using legislation to address how they collect, use, and report education data in addition to how they safeguard it.

External determinants include language, demographics, geography, technology, politics, and financial and economic trends. Religion is also one of these external determinants that can influence an education system, as well as the education systems of the. The BRICS member countries consist of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The BRICS member countries are one of the most organized and supportive international cooperation organizations that currently exist. Religion is considered a controversial and sensitive topic. This research aimed to determine how religion as an external determinant influences the education systems of the BRICS member countries. The study focused on the differences and similarities that can be identified based on religion as an external determinant of the various education systems in the BRICS member countries. The BRICS member countries were deliberately chosen for this study because each member state is considered a secular country in terms of religion, yet each member state treats religion differently in their country. The comparative method was used during this study to identify the best practices from the BRICS member countries. The interpretive research paradigm was used during this study using the qualitative research approach. The document analysis was used during the study to analyse the content of policies, legislation, articles, and government publications using content analysis to be able to identify themes to be able to perform the comparison between the different education systems of the BRICS member countries. The findings from this study are as follows: Religion as an external determinant of an education system does have a significant influence on the education systems of the various BRICS member countries. It is very important to observe and describe these findings from the context of the various member states. [For the complete Volume 20 proceedings, see ED622631.]",

Universities have been closed, but solutions to continue teaching and learning activities were offered by the online platforms. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate how university medical students perceive this current form of education. The results of the survey highlighted that most of the students were satisfied with the measures taken by the university during the COVID-19 outbreak and the way the teaching-learning-assessment process took place. However, some negative aspects were reported, such as: lack of an adequate infrastructure for some students, less effective teacher-student communication and interaction, impossibility of performing practical applications, lack of socialization, less objective examination, possibility of physical and mental health problems. The main conclusion is that the students prefer to continue with hybrid model of learning, where the theoretical classes could be online, but practical classes would be face-to-face. Universities, now more than ever, should invest in teacher professional development of their faculty -- for teachers to be updated on effective pedagogical methods with or without the use of online technologies.

This paper sets out to determine the role educators play in the transformation of schools towards racial integration, as well as their nature and perception in facilitating racial integration in the truest sense. Findings emanating from this research indicate that the striking down of the policies and educational system of the Apartheid regime has propelled educators from segregated backgrounds into teaching learners from different racially diverse backgrounds. Similarly, most learners for the first time are being taught by racially diverse educators. A qualitative framework is used to investigate firsthand experiences of managing racial integration in relation to educators and school management, and their role in determining successful racial integration in secondary schools in South Africa. The purpose of this paper is to prepare educators with the accumulative knowledge, understanding and tenets of the Critical Race Theory (CRT) on how to create opportunities for decolonising classroom content and practice as well as addressing the weaknesses in previous approaches to racially integrate learners in desegregated schools.

The new term of early career teacher (ECT) has replaced the NQT label and the one-year programme has been extended to two, based on the &quot;Early Career Framework.&quot; The reasons for the change are to aid recruitment, prevent high numbers leaving the profession early and to provide a better, more structured and statutory framework for new teachers' development in schools. However, this has resulted in considerable change and accompanying stress for school leaders and staff, with a greatly increased workload. Training materials have been provided, including programmes for induction tutors, mentors and for the ECTs, though schools may write their own. Funding has also been provided by government to cover the costs of providing meeting, observation and discussion times. The final decision as to passing of the Teachers' Standards is now in the hands of an external body, who will moderate the training provided and make the final decision on each ECT's induction success or failure. First results show agreement from most of those concerned that the more structured approach to induction and longer time is a plus, but there are grave concerns about the rigidity of the programme and the time management of a fluid situation plus, the added responsibilities for staff.

Regardless their commitment, it is evident that many countries, especially developing ones struggle to effectively implement sustainable principles and practices in academia. This qualitative study brings attention to challenges associated with implementation of Education for Sustainable Development as well as suggestions how to promote ESD within teacher training and professional development of educators. The study is grounded in international literature review; however, findings come from the developing world where the authors are located. The results indicate the need to transfer sustainability-related pedagogical knowledge and competencies to educators and prospective teachers. In addition, in order to strengthen sustainable development, higher education institutions need to adapt a holistic approach and implement sustainability principles, knowledge, and practices within all academic activities.

Connell's theory of masculinity underpins this study. The aim of this paper is to answer the following two research questions: What are the most important gender themes in Kinney's cartoon diaries? Can teachers use Kinney's cartoon diaries to create an awareness of gender inequality? I identified the following gender themes that permitted hegemonic masculinities: bullying and violence, bravery, the importance of sport, gender relations and the tension of growing up in a matriarchal-patriarchal household. The study found that Kinney's books could be used as a point of departure to explain to children that the alpha male is not solely responsible for gender inequality and violence. The wimpy, seemingly innocent and helpless kid can also be the instigator of inequality between genders or within genders. The popularity and availability of Kinney's books make them an ideal vehicle for teachers worldwide to create a sensitivity for gender issues.

        "description":"Vignettes, as a research method, presents short hypothetical stories to individuals to elicit their views on a particular topic. A review of the literature indicates that although vignettes have successfully gleaned detailed data on phenomena, few research studies have employed this valuable method in higher education institutions' (HEIs) contexts globally. This paper provides findings from a qualitative study that generated data through vignettes to understand students' perceptions of (dis)advantage. Twenty-four honours students from five faculties at one HEI in South Africa participated in the study. Findings indicate that vignettes more effectively glean rich qualitative data on sensitive or complex topics than other research methods. The method can prompt open discussions on topics usually regarded as sensitive by the participants because it helps them to reflect on their own lived experiences of (dis)advantage in HEIs. More importantly, this study shows that vignettes reveal the hidden and unexpected of what constitutes (dis)advantage, for example, low-income students have certain advantages that contributed to their success. This finding has direct implications for the design of interventions at HEIs aimed at reducing inequality. [For the complete Volume 20 proceedings, see ED622631.]",

        "description":"Due to the necessity of English knowledge for international education, business, and travel, students, parents, and educators have made English language learning a priority from an early age. However, traditional English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms are no longer the only option. Types of classes which integrate language learning and course subject material are becoming more common throughout Europe and worldwide. This study aims to investigate the relationship between students' participation in nonlanguage (e.g., math, science, history) classes taught fully or partly in English and their use of English during free time activities. Data collected from a large-scale survey of 1,403 Czech lower secondary students from different types of schools is examined. About half of the students in the sample came from public or private multi-year grammar schools, which are generally prestigious and selective institutions. The other half of the students came from public or private basic schools. Findings suggest that students who participate in Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) and English as a medium of instruction (EMI) classes are overall more likely to engage in English-related free time activities and are significantly more likely to participate in activities that require active communication with other English speakers. Thus, these CLIL and EMI students use English in free time activities more often, which further supports their English knowledge and skills. These students also are more likely to hold a certificate in English and more likely to use English for active communication. In future research, the role that socio-economic status (SES) plays in free time activities and CLIL and EMI participation is examined, as it is possible that both activities are supported by highly-educated, high SES parents.

Participants in our study included both adolescents on the autism spectrum and typically developing adolescents, who were asked to complete the Betty's Brain educational-technology-based science activity as well as a social-reasoning movie question-answering activity. Results include qualitative observations of general student engagement and challenges as well as quantitative measures of performance and eye gaze, including key differences observed across our two sample groups, with the goal of informing the design and adaptation of future technology-based interventions. Our findings suggest specific considerations for designing educational technologies for adolescents on the autism spectrum, including: (1) finding ways to help students follow instructional/tutorial portions of new technologies, especially when lengthy instructions and/or complex interfaces are involved; (2) proactively anticipating and finding ways to mitigate potential student episodes of frustration / dysregulation while using the technology; and (3) capitalizing on features of the technology found to be engaging/motivating for students.

The aim of the paper is to give a brief overview of examples from the literature related to fuzzy logic and to point out the presence of fuzzy linguistic variables in the everyday life of a preschool child, as well as the importance of developing and respecting the approximate reasoning of preschool children. Although crisp mathematics requires crisp arguments that characterize our cognitive development, preschoolers start from common argumentation and use vague words. Fuzzy logic is an excellent tool for supporting such approximate reasoning which allows preschoolers to model real-life situations using vague words.",

        "description":"Obtaining students' attitudes, opinions, feedback, etc., plays an essential role in the higher educational process because it makes it more bidirectional and engaging for the students. Including larger populations in surveys often calls for informational structuring/standardization for subsequent statistical post-processing. Moreover, it brings along some well-known methodological issues (e.g., the central tendency in Likert scale-based surveys). Here we build upon a relatively large student survey case previously presented more extensively in [1]. That survey was devoted to various aspects of economics and business-related education offered on an elective basis to electrical engineering and computer science students. Here we focus on the interference between the intrinsic information (that is, the &quot;true type&quot; student responses) and the processing method that, if not designed carefully, can increase incentives for students to conceal their true type and recourse to the neutral (&quot;central&quot;) answers. We also discuss our new practical approach currently tested in a similar population.",

This teachers' edition is designed to meet such a condition. In its plan it is brief and schematic rather than complete and detailed. Less time should be required to prepare a lesson from this outline than from a text giving the solutions in full. For those exercises involving not more than one process in their solution the answers only are given. If two or more processes are required in a solution, an outline is given which covers each step of the work. Moreover, after each indicated step of the work, the result obtained by taking that step is set down. This scheme affords an easy method of tracing a solution. In the solution of problems the meaning of each letter representing an unknown is clearly stated, the equations representing the conditions of the problems in terms of these letters are given, and the schematic solution of the equation or system always follows. The authors and publishers desire the cooperation of teachers and school authorities in limiting the circulation of this book to actual teachers of algebra.

A large amount of review material is to be found at the point where the second year of work commences, since it was felt that there should be an adequate opportunity for the pupil to return to the fundamentals of algebraic technique before proceeding with the more advanced work of the second year. As in the case of the former edition, emphasis has been placed on the Oral Exercises which appear at the beginning of the treatment of each new topic. The hint has also been used freely in the lists of written exercises in order to call the attention of the pupil to the best approach to the particular problem represented in the new exercises, before they have had a chance to develop wrong habits in the performance of their task. The work on graphs has been considerably modified in treatment to conform to modern tendencies in graphical presentation. The first approach to the subject is from the direction of graphing statistics. The pupil will probably already be familiar with graphs as they appear in the daily newspapers and current periodicals. This work is included early in the text as it is of interest to the student and tends to make them feel more at home in the subject of algebra. Throughout the book every effort has been made to provide the pupil with problems of real interest dealing with situations already more or less familiar.",

        "author":["Deliveli, Kismet"],
        "description":"Sound-based sentence method has been used to teach reading and writing (since the 2005-2006) in Turkey. This method, however, might pose difficulties in learning &quot;sound-syllable-word-phrase&quot; formations for students with intellectual disability. The aim of this research proposes a new method of literacy for students with intellectual disability. Conducted using document reviewing method, the study developed the &quot;Sentence-Targeted Syllable Method&quot; based on the language and cognitive development characteristics of children with intellectual disability and the Turkish language structure. This method firstly teaches syllables and words of a targeted sentence. For example, to teach &quot;Ali lale al&quot;, the syllables &quot;la-le-li&quot; are taught to reach the word &quot;lale&quot;, and then students are instructed to read/write the syllables &quot;al-il-el&quot; to form the targeted sentence. In the first stage, the targeted sentence is formed by highlighting the vowels &quot;a, e, i, i, o, o, u, ü&quot; and the consonants &quot;l, b, n, y, ç, t, s, k, s&quot; instructing students to read/write the syllables and then the words of the targeted sentence. New syllables-words-sentences are generated by splitting sentences into sounds. In the second stage, the sounds &quot;p, r, m, z, g, v, d, f, c, h, g, j&quot; are finally taught through synthesis, which is followed by other practices to improve children's literacy.",

        "description":"Research on parental involvement has traditionally focused on social class differences in parenting behavior throughout early childhood and K-12 schooling. Yet there is mounting evidence that similar class divides persist as children exit high school and progress through young adulthood. This review examines parents' roles in young adults' lives, focusing on class differences in non-financial forms of involvement. These processes are often hidden from public view and have received less attention in prior reviews. Beginning with the transition out of high school, I discuss current research on parents' roles in relation to five traditional young adult milestones: finishing school, finding a job, leaving the family home, getting married, and becoming a parent (Furstenberg, 2010). The findings underscore that understanding the transition to adulthood requires understanding young adults' relationships with parents.",

We present results from a randomized evaluation of a teacher and principal incentive programme in India that offered a non-pecuniary recognition reward based on students' test scores on standardized assessments. We find a positive (0.16 SD) yet statistically insignificant effect on student performance when both teachers and principals are incentivized. In schools where only teachers are incentivized, the estimates remain statistically insignificant but are also much smaller in magnitude (0.012 SD). Our findings provide suggestive evidence that recognition rewards may have the potential as a low-cost tool to improve student achievement when both teachers and principals are incentivized. However, further research is required to substantiate the findings and investigate the mechanisms at play.

        "description":"Dyslexia is a neuro-sensory issue that makes reading challenging. However, Dyslexic Phonemic R[subscript 3] is a novel approach that improved the phonological development and resolved the reading challenges of dyslexia. The primary goal of the study was (1) to evaluate the current state of the phonemic and auditory symptoms of children with dyslexia and (2) To study the effects of the Dyslexic Phonemic R[subscript 3] Approach on the reading development of children with dyslexia. The Dyslexic Phonemic R[subscript 3] Approach was the only experimental group in the case study, which examined the prevalence of dyslexia among the participants. There was no control group. 45 students with dyslexia were the participants chosen from thirty schools in the Indian town of Silchar. These adolescents were chosen from a population of 12-13-year-olds with auditory and phonemic deficiencies after getting the consents of their parents. The Dyslexic Phonemic R3 Approach significantly improved the reading, and spelling habit of student with dyslexia. The dyslexic phonemic R3 approach was developed in Assam University, Silchar, India by Dr. Ananta Kumar Jena. Vowels in this context are phonemic patterns that are primarily divided into two types: long and short vowels, and syllables (closed and open). In many situations, short vowels are most frequently utilised. The Dyslexia-Phonemic R3 technique uses these three procedures to diagnose dyslexia.",

The sample of the study consisted of 1305 educators, 784 teachers, and 521 pre-service teachers in 15 different branches in the 2021-2022 academic year. The sample of the research conducted in the relational survey model was selected by a simple random sampling method. In the research, the Inclination to Ethical Values Scale developed by Kaya (2015) was used as a data collection tool. The scale has three dimensions: Love, justice, and cooperation. In the analysis of the data, mean, standard deviation, frequency, percentage, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal Wallis test were used and .05 significance level was taken into account in the interpretation of the data. According to the research findings, teachers and pre-service teachers got very high scores on the scale. While there was no difference in gender for the level of susceptibility to ethical values; significant results were founded-determined in favor of teachers in terms of status; in favor of physical education teachers in-branch comparison; in favor of those with more than 16 years of service according to professional seniority and in favor of those who do regular physical activity. As a result of the research; it has been seen that teachers and pre-service teachers are very inclined to ethical values and they internalize the value of love the most. Planning functional pre-service and in-service training for pre-service teachers who have not yet started the profession or for teachers who are newly started to the profession. In-depth research is recommended to examine why teachers who engage in regular physical activity have a high ethical orientation.",

        "description":"Forty-five million Americans collectively owe $1.7 trillion in student loan debt, and women hold nearly two-thirds of it. Black borrowers are the group most negatively affected by student loans, in large part because of systemic racism, the inequitable distribution of wealth, a stratified labor market, and rising college costs. Because Black women exist at the intersection of two marginalized identities and experience sexism and racism at the same time, they make less money and often need to borrow more to cover the cost of attendance, and struggle significantly with repayment. Drawing on data from federal sources and the National Black Student Debt Study, this brief paints a picture of how Black women experience student debt and how the existing repayment system often fails them. It is the first in a four-part series using qualitative data from the National Black Student Debt Study. The forthcoming briefs will cover income-driven repayment plans, the impact of student debt on mental health, and Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) loans. [For a comprehensive report based on the study, &quot;Jim Crow Debt: How Black Borrowers Experience Student Loans,&quot; see ED617539.]",

This study looks at the standpoint of Filipino students on going back to regular face-to-face schooling. There were 2,274 students of different tiers of education (high school, collegiate, graduate) from different major island groups of the Philippines (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao) who participated in the study. The study used a mixed method of descriptive statistics to present the quantitative data gathered and thematic analysis of qualitative responses from the subjects. The majority of all the respondents favored going back to the physical classroom, and little only favored staying using the distance mode. In the qualitative analysis, the recurring reasons of the students varied from personal, economic, and fear of getting the virus. It was concluded that Filipino students want to go back to schooling. Moreover, a sizeable amount preferred hybrid while a small number preferred to stay in online or distance mode. Educational institutions should always observe the COVID-19 protocol when students go back.",

        "description":"E-Learning is the most popular open learning multimedia modality of delivering education and training. It is used for enhancing learning opportunities and facilitating student access and success in education. It offers a multimedia environment which supports interactive communication where the users have full control of their learning. The state of being ready for E-learning i.e. E-learning Readiness (ELR) is an essential condition which determines whether the students, faculty members and educational institutions can successfully embrace it or not. To determine the ELR, the research available on ELR claims that various factors like &quot;Technological Readiness, Psychological Readiness, Content Readiness, Infrastructure Readiness&quot; etc. determine ELR. Before considering E-learning as a feasible option to deliver education in higher education (HE), it becomes vital to examine and measure these factors. Hence the main objective of the present study is to explore about the factors of E-learning and also to explore the indicators to measure these factors. The study concludes that the indicators in technological readiness should measure participants' technological skills, their competence and knowledge on E-learning technology and they should measure the advanced technological skills of the participants rather than just their basic ICT skills. The indicators of psychological readiness should measure mental preparedness, views &amp; opinions and attitude towards E-learning of both students and faculties. For Infrastructure readiness, the indicators in this dimension should rate the ICT infrastructure in the institution/organization. Moreover, the indicators in Pedagogical readiness should measure the knowledge of faculties to utilize various E-learning based teaching strategies.",

        "author":["Campbell, Oladele O.",
          "Atagana, Harrison I."],
        "description":"An engaging first programming class (CS1) often inspires students' passion for computer science (CS). However, the evidence in the literature suggests that the average CS1 classes are anything but engaging for many students. The performance of CS compared to other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses in international student engagement surveys seems to substantiate CS1 failure, attrition rates, and lack of diversity in most CS classes. Meanwhile, for its simplicity in introducing programming to beginners, primary and secondary schools use &quot;Scratch,&quot; an educational programming environment developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. For the same reason, higher institutions now include some forms of &quot;Scratch&quot; instruction in CS1. The question remains, to what extent is &quot;Scratch&quot; engaging, especially for students in higher education? This study addressed this gap by observing college computer science students exposed to a constructionist &quot;Scratch&quot; programming pedagogy. We adopted a descriptive design based on quantitative observations. To observe the class during a weekly 2-hour session, we employed five CS educators, one observer per week. Each observer, employing a 20-item observation protocol, rated the extent of affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement of first-year CS students in a polytechnic in North Central Nigeria. Most of the students were learning to program for the first time. Analysis of the data showed a significant agreement in the ratings of the five observers for overall student engagement, although the impact was moderate. However, while agreement in their ratings for affective engagement was significant, with a large effect, there was no significant concordance in their ratings for behavioral engagement. Observers also significantly agreed in their ratings for cognitive engagement; however, the impact was moderate. These findings suggest that employing &quot;Scratch&quot; in higher education can be engaging and useful, especially for students with no prior programming experience.",

Although the traditional education system serves as a good source of knowledge, they have been consistently proven to lack emphasis on the overall development of students. Therefore, in recent years, the integration of art in education has been promoted. Education media and education theater are interactive education methodologies that improve the learning experience of students and develop their cognitive skills. This study assesses the research gaps in the field of educational media and educational theater through a comparison of critical studies published in Scopus and the Web of Science database. The areas of educational media prevalence, usage of theater in education, educational media role, and benefits of educational theater have been explored. The analysis identifies the main problems and is based on the current education sector needs. Accordingly, suggestions for improvement for the Egyptian education ministry are provided.",

However, while collaborative learning introduced a prospective tool for FLA, it has not been much researched in the L2 classroom context, particularly in Vietnam. This paper focuses on using collaborative learning to reduce foreign language anxiety and enhance the L2 speaking performance of young learners at an English center in Ho Chi Minh city. A combination of tools, including Aydin et al.'s (2017) Children Foreign Language Anxiety Scale (CFLAS) for the pre-tests and post-tests, the teacher's diary, and follow-up interviews, was used to measure the changes in learner' FLA level and speaking performance. After five-week implementations, these learners' FLA was slightly alleviated, and their speaking performance was improved using a collaborative learning approach. Moreover, learners were found to have positive attitudes and experience with learning in the new approach. These findings implied that collaborative learning could be a potential treatment to help L2 learners uncover their anxious selves and find more confidence in using the target language.",

        "description":"In this book, Susan Cornwall aims to illustrate the beauty and value of practical piety, by an attractive exhibition of its salutary influence amid the daily duties and cares and common incidents of life. For this reason, Cornwall selected an interesting phase of mental habits, which, though combining some of the most striking points of strongly-marked characters in every class and station, is very frequently overlooked. The intelligent reader, therefore, will find in the sketches presented, such a combination of pure examples and crude specimens of life and manners, as to the unreflecting may seem almost inconsistent with the time and place to which it is ascribed. It is unquestionable, that even now, as well in the most refined as in the least cultivated circles, a careful observer, conversant with the modes of thought current among different classes, may daily detect, in the vain reliance of many persons upon cherished omens of good fortune, and their vain resistance to superstitious fears of imaginary ills, a base counterfeit of the first principle of practical piety, faith in Divine providence. And -it is one of the remarkable features of the present time, that some theories, which lay claim to a place among principles of science, have an obvious tendency to carry back the minds of many to confidence, not only in hurtful superstitions, but also in some of the blasphemous deceits of ancient heathenism; which, in the various forms of necromancy and witchcraft, were the source of all superstitious signs or omens that still prevail, in some degree, in Christian lands. Scientific speculation, assuming the name of philosophy, has impiously pretended even to invade the recesses of the invisible world, and to give a tangible reality to the fancies of heathen fiction, with its fabled &quot;shades&quot; of the departed.",

        "description":"Universal approaches have not sufficiently improved higher education outcomes for Black, Latino, and Indigenous students, and students from low-income backgrounds because these broad interventions are not targeted toward specific populations. Student voices and interests must be centered in policy and practice, and higher education leaders and institutions that work with and on behalf of Black, Latino, or Indigenous students are well positioned to identify the programs, partnerships, and investments that will most benefit those students. Having clear alignment on the high impact policy and programmatic priorities of these higher education leaders helps funders, policymakers, and technical assistance providers make investments that are more racially equitable. The Education Trust convened key leaders from a number of intermediary higher education organizations to discuss policy and programmatic priorities that would support the equitable distribution and implementation of public and private higher education funding. Panelists and participants repeatedly highlighted five priorities that will help to ensure equity in these higher education investments: (1) Put student voices first; (2) Rely on existing experts and invest in building expertise; (3) Build cultural competence and show humility toward students, their communities, and the organizations that represent them; (4) Interrogate data and reevaluate underlying assumptions and metrics; and (5) Focus on flexible dollars that institutions can use to address students' greatest needs.",

The U.S. Department of Education defines capacity-building (CB) services as assistance that strengthens an individual's or organization's ability to engage in continuous improvement and achieve expected outcomes. Given the range of CB services that Regional Comprehensive Centers can provide to SEAs, REAs, and LEAs, a needs assessment can help regional comprehensive center staff understand recipients' needs and can help clarify how the stakeholder will benefit from the Center's services. Regional Comprehensive Centers' needs assessment and planning typically focus on interactive discussions with State education leaders and SEA staff. This Preliminary Capacity-Building Needs Assessment is meant to help focus those discussions on core components of CB and corresponding needs and, in short, help Centers and stakeholders decide whether CB services are needed and, if so, which components are crucial.",

That number is used to calculate the &quot;student parent affordability gap,&quot; that is, the estimated amount a student parent from a low-income background must come up with--after grants, scholarships, and earnings from working 10 hours per week at the state minimum wage have been taken into account--to cover the cost of child care and the full cost of attending a four-year college. Key findings show: (1) There is no state in which a student parent can work 10 hours per week at the minimum wage and afford both tuition and child care at a public college or university; (2) Many states that look affordable based on their reported net price actually have a wider affordability gap for student parents when one factors in the cost of child care; (3) The out-of-pocket cost of attending a public college is 2 to 5 times higher for student parents than for their other low-income peers without children; (4) A student parent would need to work 52 hours per week, on average, to cover child care and tuition costs at a four-year public college or university in the U.S; and (5) Net price alone is not a good indicator of college affordability for student parents; because child care access and costs vary widely; the number of hours a student parent must work to afford college and child care will also depend on their state minimum wage.

The reasons for entry into foster care are multiple, complex, and often intertwined with the social and environmental challenges associated with poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the social and environmental challenges facing students. Because many schools, child welfare agencies, courts, and other businesses and agencies closed for much of the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, students in foster care experienced reduced access to in-person education and supports. As the state and schools work to recover from the pandemic, sustained attention will be necessary to ensure these students have access to the services they need to succeed. Using pre-COVID-19 statewide education data and interviews with foster youth services coordinators at county offices of education, this report examines the school conditions and education outcomes for students in foster care; the organizational, logistical, and data challenges to providing coordinated support; and promising practices for future supports.",

Together, these indicators signal the overall wage conditions underlying efforts to attract and retain well-prepared teachers across a state. The final table in the series shows all three indicators for each state. Teacher starting salaries and cost of living vary by district, so within states (with the exception of Hawaii and Washington, DC, which each comprise a single school district), there are districts that will be higher or lower than their state average on these indicators.",

        "description":"Nearly half of U.S. schools are facing COVID-related staff shortages that threaten the efforts to shape programming and invest in resources to solve students' unfinished learning. Without enough teachers and support staff, students won't receive rigorous instruction, won't have access to targeted intensive tutoring to address their unfinished learning, and won't receive mental health supports and experience the positive school environments they need to thrive. High turnover also creates instability that disrupts relationships between adults and students and makes it difficult for schools to create coherent instruction and implement new initiatives. This report provides some short- and long-term actions that state and district leaders can take to address these shortages and support the most underserved students and teachers to prevent deeper, persistent inequities.",

The authors found that although many Black and Latino students aspire to go to college and are interested in STEM subjects, very few are actually enrolled in AP STEM courses that would prepare them for college and a STEM career. This new research, based on survey data from approximately 200,000 students from various backgrounds across 184 schools, also indicates that a positive and inviting school climate plays an important role in getting more Black and Latino students into advanced courses. There are many policies and practices that school, district, and state leaders can implement to remove the systemic barriers and conditions that shut Black and Latino students out of advanced STEM courses. This report includes recommendations on how to advance equity in access to and success in advanced coursework, including creating positive school climates where students of color feel safe, have a sense of belonging, and see themselves reflected in the curriculum.",

It is designed to provide instruction specifically to ELLs. During the 2014-2015 school year, the Imagine Learning (IL) program was implemented across the District, mostly for students at the initial level of participation in the English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program. Students who started participating in the program no later than November of 2014 and accumulated at least 20 hours of program participation were selected for potential inclusion in the Program Sample. Not all schools started participating in it at the beginning of the school year. This fact and the almost universal implementation of the program presented a challenge in selecting acceptable samples of students participating and not participating in the program. The results of the statistical analyses indicate that program students did not outperform comparison students (in the sense of statistically significant differences) in any of the comparisons.",

One important investment was extending state funding for transitional kindergarten (TK), previously just for older 4-year-olds, to all 4-year-olds by 2025-26. To ensure the quality of new preschool investments, California must recruit and prepare a sufficient number of qualified teachers in TK and other early childhood programs--a challenge given the rapid expansion of the program. This challenge is even greater during the COVID-19 pandemic, when school districts and early childhood programs are facing significant staffing shortages. This report provides estimates of how many TK teachers California will need through 2025-26 and discusses potential pathways to support a diverse, well-prepared workforce, both in TK and in other early childhood programs. The authors also offer recommendations that state policymakers could follow to stabilize, support, and expand the broader early childhood workforce and to build pathways for racially, linguistically, and culturally diverse educators.

        "description":"Advances in the science of learning and development, along with the increasing demands of life and work in the 21st century, are raising expectations for schools and educators. Policy levers that affect the teacher workforce will play a key role in meeting these expectations. This report, one of a series of state policy studies produced by the Learning Policy Institute in collaboration with the Council of Chief State School Officers, examines teacher licensure and preparation program approval systems in Wisconsin. This study was designed to assess how these systems are advancing the preparation of a stable, diverse, well-qualified, and equitably distributed teacher workforce to support all students' deeper learning and social, emotional, and academic development. This report draws upon multiple sources, including state teacher and student data, analyses of statutory and regulatory frameworks and policy activities, and interviews with educators and state agency staff. It opens with a description of the state policy context, including challenges in public education and the teacher workforce. After a description of the recent policymaking activity that has created current systems, the report lays out the workings of licensure and program approval in detail. Finally, the report draws on contemporary research and state policy examples to provide recommendations aimed at systemic improvement and intended to help policymakers move closer to Wisconsin's teacher workforce goals.",

Learning and development was assessed using children's fall and spring scores on three domains of the Desired Results Developmental Profile, a developmental assessment administered by children's classroom teachers. The authors used multiple regression models to estimate the additional months of learning and development associated with attending a higher-rated program (Tier 4 or Tier 5) above and beyond the months of learning and development projected for a child attending a program rated Tier 3. The relatively small number of programs rated Tiers 1 and 2 were excluded from the analysis. The study suggests that attending a higher-quality-rated program is associated with greater learning and development than attending a lower-quality-rated program.

These barriers to success are compounded when children are discriminated against because of their race, ethnicity, English learner status, religion, dis/ability status, and immigration status. Because their needs are often ignored, children living below the poverty line have been called the &quot;invisible Americans.&quot; But, of course, they are not invisible. In too many instances, policymakers, and society at large, have turned a blind eye to how material hardship results in suffering and loss of opportunity for generations of children. The purpose of this report is to make what is &quot;invisible&quot; visible and to suggest three evidence-based strategies that have the capacity to enable educators, in collaboration with the families and the communities they serve, to create learning environments in which students living in deep poverty are supported and successful. While education alone cannot eliminate childhood deep poverty, it is a key component for a comprehensive approach to building an enduring equal-opportunity society.",

        "description":"Many studies confirm that segregated schools for minoritized students produced worsened academic, economic, health, and criminal justice outcomes over the short and long term. By contrast, a substantial body of research establishes that students of all races benefit from attending diverse schools. Despite this evidence, the tools for achieving greater integration have been limited by courts and legislatures in the past few decades, and new approaches to achieve integration are needed. One tool that could be leveraged more fully to create high-quality, integrated educational environments is the use of magnet schools. Well-designed magnet schools can support desegregation and improve student learning, as they create innovative education models and accommodate geographically dispersed families to produce a racially and economically integrated student body. This report presents a policy proposal for a new, federally coordinated approach to magnet school development, conducted under the framework of the Fair Housing Act's mandate to affirmatively further fair housing. This proposal envisions an interagency effort conducted by both the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Education, potentially incorporating programs managed by other federal agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Social science research has long established the link between housing and K-12 education, and magnet schools represent a natural subject in which to pioneer interagency coordination on these two policy spheres. But federal civil rights policy, especially in recent decades, has often addressed schools and housing in separate silos. This report offers an opportunity to improve and refine several legal and policy tools for desegregating schools and communities.",

Young children benefit greatly from exposure to racial, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity during this crucial and formative period, yet many existing policies may inadvertently deter classroom diversity and inclusion. Promoting diversity and inclusion within the classroom is a catalyst for meeting developmental milestones and promoting greater social understanding and equity. This brief seeks to address the importance of promoting diverse and inclusive settings by presenting the current state of preschool, highlighting the benefits of preschool diversity, and identifying policies, institutional factors, and initiatives that foster diversity.

This &quot;deeper learning&quot;--once offered to the small share of students presumed to be preparing for thinking work-- is now a requirement for all. Yet the journey to deeper learning is a challenging one in the inequitable school system we have inherited in the United States. Compounding the barriers are the many other sources of inequality in our society: dramatic income inequalities, high rates of childhood poverty, and unequal school funding and access to resources of all kinds. This brief describes the key civil rights foundations that have been--and continue to be--essential to paving a path toward possibilities for deeper learning for all: those that secure safe communities, adequate school resources, inclusive environments, well-prepared teachers, and access to quality curriculum. It identifies the evidence-based policies and practices that can ensure that every student has access to a high-quality education focused on meaningful learning.

The Summer Programs are comprised of seven In-Class components and one Out-of-Class component. Four of the In-Class components targeted the elementary grades and focused on strengthening reading comprehension and stimulating readiness skills. The other two In-Class components targeted the secondary grades and focused on advancing progression/promotion and increasing opportunities for graduation. The Out-of-Class component provided students with access to a variety of Internet based software applications outside of the regular school setting through hypertext links available on the Student Portal. The six applications that comprise the Links to Learning suite were also made available to students during the summer on an ongoing basis. The results for the Summer Programs indicate that the in-class reading components did not have a beneficial impact on the achievement of the students who used them. The finding for the Literacy for Rising Third Grade Students program is consistent with that found for the Third Grade Summer Reading Camps. Algebra I remediation significantly improved the odds of passing the End of Course exam for participants. The paucity of usage and outcome data precluded any impact assessment of the out-of-class software programs, but nearly 200 students per day made used of these resources in summer 2015.",

Over these nearly two decades, a picture of increasingly alarming trends has emerged. Simply put, teachers are paid less (in weekly wages and total compensation) than their nonteacher college-educated counterparts, and the situation has worsened considerably over time. To analyze teacher pay and compensation through 2020 and 2021 this report uses two sources of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups (CPS-ORG) and BLS's National Compensation Survey's Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC). The findings are presented in four sections. First, trends in annual average weekly wages (adjusted for inflation) from 1979 through 2021 for teachers and other college graduates are presented. Next, annual estimates of the national teacher weekly wage penalty using standard regression techniques to control for systematic differences in age, education, state of residence, and other factors known to affect wage rates are reported. Third, regression-adjusted estimates of the teacher pay gap for each state and for the District of Columbia are offered. Finally, nonwage benefits to estimate a total compensation penalty that includes wages and benefits at the national level (which is not possible for each state) are factored in.",

        "description":"Narration has been shown to be a foundational skill for literacy development in school-age children. Elementary teachers routinely conduct classroom lessons that focus on reading decoding and comprehension, but they rarely provide instruction in oral narration (Hall et al., 2021). This multisite randomized controlled trial was designed to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of the &quot;Supporting Knowledge of Language and Literacy&quot; (&quot;SKILL&quot;) intervention program for improving oral narrative comprehension and production. Three hundred fifty-seven students who were at-risk for language and literacy difficulties in Grades 1-4 in 13 schools across seven school districts were randomly assigned to the &quot;SKILL&quot; treatment condition or a business as usual (BAU) control condition. &quot;SKILL&quot; was provided to small groups of two to four students in 36 thirty-minute lessons across a 3-month period. Multilevel modeling with students nested within teachers and teachers nested within schools revealed students who received the &quot;SKILL&quot; treatment significantly outperformed students in the BAU condition on measures of oral narrative comprehension and production immediately after treatment. Oral narrative production for the &quot;SKILL&quot; treatment group remained significantly more advanced at follow-up testing conducted 5 months after intervention ended. Improvements in oral narration generalized to a measure of written narration at posttest and the treatment advantage was maintained at follow-up. Grade level did not moderate effects for oral narration, but it did for reading comprehension, with a higher impact for students in grades 3 and 4.

        "description":"In 1997, the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) was launched to provide descriptive, nationally representative information on the characteristics, experiences, and development of Head Start children and families, and the characteristics of the Head Start programs and staff who serve them. Until 2015, FACES only included children, families, and programs in Head Start Regions I-X. In 2015, the American Indian/Alaska Native Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (AI/AN FACES) was launched, which collects information children, families, and programs in Head Start Region XI. Spring data collection for FACES and AI/AN FACES began in late February 2020, just before Head Start centers nationwide began closing due to concerns around the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). By mid-March 2020, due to COVID-19, most Head Start programs closed physical buildings and changed their operations to continue to meet the needs of the families they serve. Because programs were adjusting their services and communication with both families and staff in a variety of ways, both FACES and AI/AN FACES added items to the center director and program director surveys to capture their response to COVID-19 and upcoming summer plans to still provide services.

Programs and initiatives at the federal and state levels include incentives to expand access to high quality care to all children. The number and range of programs and initiatives, however, and the expectations that come with them, make the ECE service landscape a complicated one for providers to navigate. In addition to the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS), Head Start programs or centers can be subject to other state regulations or program standards. This brief provides information from spring 2020, from the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2019 about how Head Start programs interact with other systems that support ECE. The findings can help policymakers and others who are working to strengthen alignment, coordination, and collaboration across the ECE system to better serve children and families.",

They compared New Orleans to similar neighboring districts from 2010 to 2015, using student test score growth to measure teacher performance. The findings highlight the complexities of policies intended to increase the quality of teaching.

The COVID Constituency seeks to collect firsthand experiences, perceptions, and priorities from students, parents, and teachers, and then translate them into actionable policies that will fundamentally change education for the better. This report anchors this work, providing an initial landscape of existing education opinion surveys conducted since the start of the pandemic and identifying clear and significant public support for bold education initiatives.

Whole child education helps students prepare for the challenges and opportunities of today and the future by addressing students' comprehensive needs through the shared responsibility of students, families, schools, and communities. This report lays out the tenets of whole child education, the current state of whole child education, and policy considerations.",

        "description":"Many recent high school graduates remain inadequately prepared for college and are required to enroll in remedial or developmental education courses in mathematics or English upon enrollment in college. High rates of college remediation are associated with lower progression and college completion rates. To address this problem, some states, districts, and individual high schools have introduced &quot;transition courses&quot; to prepare students for college-level math and English coursework. Transition courses are typically offered to high school seniors who have been assessed as being underprepared for college math or English. This study uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of participation in a mathematics transition course on college-level math outcomes in West Virginia for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 high school senior cohorts. Our findings suggest that, among students who scored very close to the cutoff score on an assessment used to decide what students took the course, the math transition course had no statistically significant effect on improving college readiness (as measured by exemption from remedial education upon college entry due to a passing score on a placement test) and in fact had a negative impact on students' likelihood of passing a college gatekeeper math course. Possible explanations for these outcomes include that (1) the transition course may have displaced traditional senior-year courses that were in practice more rigorous than the transition course or that provided positive impacts from inclusion of higher performing peers, and that (2) the transition course curricula may not have been well aligned to the skills required for success on the COMPASS placement test. Most students who took the transition course did not pass the COMPASS, which was taken at the conclusion of the course. The specific math course studied is no longer offered; math transition courses in West Virginia now use a different curriculum.",

Based on the evidence available a year ago, CRPE reported the average K-12 student in America mastered less academic content due to the pandemic and associated disruptions to schooling. Negative impacts were generally larger in math than in reading, substantial across all grade levels, larger where students had less access to in-person instruction, and larger for Black, Hispanic, and low-income students. This year's report, based on 23 studies published since last July, offers even stronger evidence of the pandemic's negative consequences for student growth and development. The pauses to in-person schooling and related changes in family and community life over the past year continued to interrupt most children's academic growth, but the consequences are not evenly distributed. Children whose schools were closed the longest had their learning interrupted the most--and most often, that affected low-income children and children of color in big cities. In 2022 as in 2021, the authors aim to present a coherent baseline of what is known, unknown, and needs to be known at this stage of the pandemic--and the beginning of a recovery from the pandemic. These reports are designed to help system leaders, community leaders, policymakers, researchers, philanthropies, the media, and others to define ambitious goals and clear metrics that ensure our education system meets every student's needs over the coming years.

        "description":"Parent-child conversations are important for children's cognitive development, children's ability to cope with stressful events, and can shape children's beliefs about the causes of illness. In the context of a global pandemic, families have faced a multitude of challenges, including changes to their routines, that they need to convey to their children. Thus, parent-child conversations about the coronavirus pandemic might convey information about the causes of illness, but also about how and why it is necessary for children to modify their behaviors to comply with new social norms and medical guidance. The main goal of this study was to examine the questions children ask about the COVID-19 pandemic and how parents answer them. This survey included responses from a national sample of 349 pre- dominantly white parents of children between the ages of 3 and 12 recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk in United States. Parents reported that although children asked about COVID-19 and its causes (17.3%), children asked primarily about lifestyle changes that occurred as a result of the pandemic (24.0%) and safety (18.4%). Parents reported answering these questions by emphasizing that the purpose of different preventative measures was to protect the child (11.8%) or the family (42.7%) and providing reassurance (13.3%). Many parents discussed how it was their social responsibility to slow the spread of the virus (38.4%). Parents of younger children tended to shield them from information about COVID-19 (p = 0.038), while parents with more knowledge were more likely to provide explanations (p &lt; 0.001). Our analysis shows that families not only discuss information about the virus but also information about changes to their lifestyle, preventative measures, and social norms.",

        "description":"Education funding in the United States relies primarily on state and local resources, with just a tiny share of total revenues allotted by the federal government. Most analyses of the primary school finance metrics--equity, adequacy, effort, and sufficiency--raise serious questions about whether the existing system is living up to the ideal of providing a sound education equitably to all children at all times. Districts in high-poverty areas, which serve larger shares of students of color, get less funding per student than districts in low-poverty areas, which predominantly serve white students, highlighting the system's inequity. School districts in general--but especially those in high-poverty areas--are not spending enough to achieve national average test scores, which is an established benchmark for assessing adequacy. Efforts states make to invest in education vary significantly. And the system is ill-prepared to adapt to unexpected emergencies. These challenges are magnified during and after recessions. Following the Great Recession that began in December 2007, per-student education revenues plummeted and did not return to pre-recession levels for about eight years. The recovery in per-student revenues was even slower in high-poverty districts. This report combines new data on funding for states and for districts by school district poverty level, and over time, with evidence documenting the positive impacts of increasing investment in education to make a case for overhauling the school finance system. It calls for reforms that would ensure a larger role for the federal government to establish a robust, stable, and consistent school funding plan that channels sufficient additional resources to less affluent students in good times and bad. Furthermore, spending on public education should be retooled as an economic stabilizer, with increases automatically kicking in during recessions. Such a program would greatly mitigate cuts to public education as budgets are depleted, and also spur aggregate demand to give the economy a needed boost.",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to tabulate the usage and analyze the impact of Reading Plus on the Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS) students who used it during the 2016-2017 school year. Reading Plus is an online application comprised of a series of modules that bolster word recognition and recall, teach phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and support reading comprehension and analysis. Reading Plus continues to be used by students in grades 3 to 10. However, despite the beneficial impact of the software, the number of users in those grades has declined by 79% in the past three years. Overall, the results from this report indicate that using Reading Plus for the developers' specified amount of time has a beneficial impact on the reading achievement of lower performing 3rd, 4th, and 10th graders and on students across ability levels in grade 7-9. The software had a positive impact on both status and growth, with the amount of growth associated with the recommended usage of this supplemental educational software ranging from 1 to 4.6 months.",

Students who participated in the Literacy for Rising Third Grade component enjoyed significantly better outcomes on the iReady Diagnostic Test administered in the fall than students who did not attend the summer sessions. In addition, the Algebra I remediation significantly improved the odds of passing the End of Course exam for summer participants in Grade 11, but not at any other grade. Finally, over two-thirds of the courses attempted by students who participated in Course Recovery were completed (over 45% with a grade of C and nearly 35% with a grade of B), helping students meet promotion criteria.

Barriers remain extremely high when it comes to access, participation and success: recognition of qualification, language barriers, financial, legal and administrative burden, lack of social interaction, access to decent living conditions and (mental) health services, university methodology, discriminations, etc. From 2016 to 2021, the European Students' Union ran the Together, Moving Forward (TMF) which empowered students to develop creative solutions to overcome educational barriers and reshape the narrative behind migration. The programme was articulated around three pillars: (1) Regranting scheme and small grants for students and youth-led groups; (2) Capacity building and networking activities; and (3) Advocacy work. This publication focusses on the regranting scheme and is a guideline that serves as a handbook to youth organisations interested in implementing the regranting scheme. The publication also includes tips and tricks on how to approach new organisations in terms of project implementation and funding.",

For youth experiencing homelessness, post-secondary education is critical for improving life outcomes, including reducing the risk of continued homelessness as adults. Yet without financial aid, these young people cannot access post-secondary education. This report analyzes data from the U.S. Department of Education that provide important insights into the challenges that unaccompanied homeless youth face in accessing federal financial aid. The data also provide baseline information to assess states' progress in implementing important new provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) that were enacted to help students experiencing homelessness transition from high school to postsecondary education. The report concludes with recommendations for policy and practice, including the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.",

However, little is known about how best to frame the intervention, particularly in the 2-year college context where students have more varied backgrounds than the samples previously studied. Using a randomized field experiment, we tested two ways of framing a UV writing intervention (student-framed vs. instructor-framed examples of UV), against a control assignment. Contrary to previous research, we found that students struggling in the course became less interested and perceived less utility value overall in UV conditions, compared to the control. The student-framed UV intervention made the course more interesting for students who were doing well in the course, but decreased grades for students struggling in the course, compared to the instructor-framed UV intervention. We examine psychological (e.g., confidence, engagement) and cognitive (linguistic indicators of cognitive processing) variables as mechanisms.",

        "description":"This study adopts a conversation analytic approach to present a close analysis of the sequential organisation of a parent-child homework activity in a Swedish-English bi-national family. Families formed within migration contexts are increasingly common in an ever-globalised world, but current research has not fully investigated how parent-child homework practices are affected by parents who possess differing levels of expertise in the societal language. This article examines a number of episodes where the progressivity of a homework activity is halted due to language-related epistemic issues. More specifically, these halts in progressivity are caused due to the homework tasks being written in Swedish in combination with the English mother's lack of language expertise in Swedish. The episodes exemplify how these epistemic deadlocks are resolved through the mobilisation of a more knowledgeable party, the Swedish father, who orients to translation as a trouble resolution tool which facilitates epistemic progression and the progressivity of the homework activity.",

        "description":"This study aims to identify the similarities and differences between English and Arabic color-based metaphorical expressions, to identify translation students' difficulties and their translation strategies. A corpus of English and Arabic color-based metaphorical expressions was collected and compared. It was found that English and Arabic color-based metaphorical expressions fall into 5 categories: (i) those that are identical in form and meaning in both languages; (ii) those that are the same in meaning but differ in form, (iii) those that are identical in form but different in meaning; (iv) those that exist in English but have no equivalents in Arabic; and (v) those that exist in Arabic but have no equivalents in English. Students' responses to a color-metaphor test showed that the students translated fewer than 25% correctly and left many items blank. Color-based metaphorical expressions similar in both languages were easy to translate such as &quot;black list,&quot; &quot;red line,&quot; &quot;green light,&quot; whereas opaque ones were difficult. Literal translation was the most common translation strategy. Implications for translation pedagogy are given.",

        "description":"Nearly 1 out of every 5 students in California K-12 schools is an English Learner, yet our latest research in brief finds that the majority of teachers across the state are not being given the resources and support they need to effectively teach math to the hundreds of thousands of emerging bilingual students. The study, California Mathematics Teachers' Perspectives On The Quality Of Their Instructional Materials For English Learners, looks at survey data from teachers and addresses 4 key findings: (1) Elementary teachers broadly used the curriculum adopted by their district, while most secondary teachers used self-created materials on a daily basis; (2) Most teachers reported that their curricular materials were aligned with the math content standards. Yet, only half responded that their materials helped them to tailor instruction to support English learners; (3) The majority of teachers reported that their materials lack relevance for students; and (4) The majority of teachers reported that their materials do not support them to assess or provide feedback on English learners' development of math language. As California is in the midst of updating the state's math framework, this important research adds yet another voice to the many educators, advocates, researchers, and others who are urging state leaders to modernize math instruction.

One goal for these studies is to provide a national picture of children's readiness for school. In this research brief, the authors use data from the most recent round of FACES and AIAN FACES in fall 2019 to evaluate the performance of direct assessments of children that were used to provide that national picture. The authors conducted similar analyses using FACES 2014 and AIAN FACES 2015 data (Malone et al. 2018) and are replicating the previous analyses because the current FACES studies have new direct assessments--one added to measure executive function and three reflecting the latest editions of those direct assessments. The current analysis focuses on these new direct assessments to understand whether they are a fair estimate of children's skills and knowledge in the domains being measured. Specifically, the authors answer two key research questions: (1) How valid is the Minnesota Executive Function Scale App (MEFS App™) as an assessment of executive function for Head Start preschool children? and (2) Do the latest editions of the cognitive assessments used in AIAN FACES 2019 show any systematic item bias against AIAN preschool children compared with White, non-Hispanic children in FACES 2019?",

In this study, phenomenology which is one of the qualitative research methods was employed. Data was collected with four science teachers in 2014-2015 academic year in Kayseri. Semi-structured interview was used as a data collection tool. Interview form was formed and was controlled by three science education experts. Data analysis was conducted through descriptive analysis. Based on findings, the participants encountered difficulties in respect to time, cost and place during project preparation process. In conclusion, the project competition positively affected the students' achievement. Nonetheless, the participants stated that project assessments should be fair, project preparation period should last longer, and should reach the large masses. As a suggestion, it is believed that clearly notifying students and teachers of project assessment project and selecting the assessment jury among stakeholders (teachers, students, managers, parents, etc.) is important.

This study surveyed a sample of parents to find out the number of hours allocated to English; kinds of textbooks used and whether parents consider them sufficient; parents' views of their children's proficiency level in the different English language skills; which language is stronger in children: English or Arabic; which language children use in communicating with their siblings, parents and relatives; the effects of learning English (L2) on Arabic (L1); and the optimal age for starting to learn English. Results showed that at government and Quranic schools, students take 1-2 hours of English a week which parents think are insufficient. At private schools, hours allocated to English vary (between 5-10). At international schools, English is the medium of instruction in all courses. Most parents prefer that children start learning English in kindergarten or first grade. English is the stronger and preferred language for international school students. Private School students have a good command of English and Arabic. Arabic is the stronger and preferred language for Government and Quranic School children. Some parents think that the textbook used at Government School are good, but some teachers are incompetent in their instructional techniques. Some Public Schools (in remote areas or small towns) are understaffed which results in reducing the teaching hours from 2 to 1 hour per week. Parents' views on the status and quality of foreign/second language education in each type of elementary school in Saudi Arabia are reported in detail.",

Sets of eligible TFA teachers were identified in 2013-14 from which the subset of teachers assigned to teach language arts and/or mathematics to students in grades 3 through 10 were included. The comparison pool included all Non-TFA teachers assigned to teach students in grades 3 through 10 in schools with TFA teachers, who did not previously participate in the TFA program. In both reading and mathematics, the bulk of TFA teachers in FCAT-tested grades were assigned to teach standard education courses. When the learning gains made by students of TFA teachers are compared with those made by students of their Non-TFA counterparts who were assigned to similar courses, a consistent impact was only found for senior high school mathematics courses. No consistent impact was found for other grade levels or subject areas. The vast majority of TFA teachers do not continue teaching in the district after completing their commitments with the program, with over 80% leaving at the end of their two year commitment.

        "description":"A regression model of predictor trade-offs is described. Each regression parameter equals the expected change in Y obtained by trading 1 point from one predictor to a second predictor. The model applies to predictor variables that sum to a constant T for all observations; for example, proportions summing to T=1.0 or percentages summing to T=100 for each observation. If predictor variables sum to a constant T for all observations and if a least squares solution exists, the predicted values for the criterion variable Y will be uniquely determined, but there will be an infinite set of linear regression weights and the familiar interpretation of regression weights does not apply. However, the regression weights are determined up to an additive constant and thus differences in regression weights [beta][subscript v] - [beta][subscript v]* are uniquely determined, readily estimable, and interpretable [beta][subscript v] - [beta][subscript v]* is the expected increase in Y given a transfer of 1 point from variable v* to variable v. The model is applied to multiple-choice test items that have four response categories, one correct and three incorrect. Results indicate that the expected outcome depends, not just on the student's number of correct answers, but also on how the student's incorrect responses are distributed over the three incorrect response types.

        "description":"There are approximately 1.5 million K-12 students and an additional 1.4 million children under the age of six experiencing homelessness across the United States. While many of these students attend traditional public schools, a growing number, at least 60,000, are enrolled in charter schools. Charter schools are independently-operated public schools that have additional flexibility to design classrooms that meet their students' academic and other needs. All charter schools operate under a contract with a charter school authorizer--usually a nonprofit organization, government agency, or university--that holds them accountable to the high standards outlined in their &quot;charter.&quot; The purpose of this report is to begin to paint a clearer picture of the experiences and outcomes of students experiencing homelessness enrolled in charter schools. This document offers basic information about the McKinney-Vento Act, case studies highlighting best practices across charter schools and networks, and key questions for charter school educators, administrators, authorizers, support staff, advocates, and others. Charter schools and partners can use this document as a starting point for conversations and action within their schools, networks, communities, and states.",

In addition to the $800 million in education funding included for identifying and supporting children and youth experiencing homelessness, there are opportunities across other funding streams to target supports for young children and families experiencing homelessness: (1) $150 million for home visiting programs (available through September 30, 2022); (2) $1 billion for Head Start (available through September 30, 2022); (3) $15 billion for the Child Care Development Block Grant (federal obligation through FY21; state obligation by September, 2023, and state liquidation by September, 2024); and (4) $24 billion to stabilize child care providers (obligated through 2022; liquidate 2023) COVID Relief Navigation Tool. For more information about the various funding streams available through the American Rescue Plan, refer to SchoolHouse Connections' COVID Relief Navigation Tool. ARP also provides nearly $123 billion in aid for K-12 education through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER), including several reservations to support students experiencing homelessness and other groups. Child care providers, Head Start programs, and SEAs and LEAs should strategically use and leverage all available funds to locate, engage, maintain connection, and support young children experiencing homelessness and their families.

        "description":"Michigan's public education system remains in a perennial rut, as it has for decades. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Michigan's fourth grade reading scores show no significant change over the past 16 years. Even before the pandemic, too many dreams have stalled, and academic achievement remains largely stagnant across key indicators for success. And the analysis from The Education Trust-Midwest shows some worrisome projections by 2030, if the state doesn't commit to transformation. These projections build upon a broad body of research and many analyses showing that student achievement has languished in Michigan in reading and math. But with greater access to effective educators, principals, and counselors, and better funded and supported schools, all students can be supported on their educational journey. With more one-on-one attention and increased opportunity for post-secondary options, every student can build a bright future. And with more investments, especially for vulnerable students, schools, and communities with the greatest needs, public education will improve overall--and the state will be stronger. This report presents: (1) The Data: Michigan's Troubled Reality: Where We Are and Where We've Been; (2) Missed Opportunities: Michigan's Stalled Efforts to Improve Implementation and Honesty Challenges; (3) Recommendations: Radical Transparency and Radical Transformation Needed; and the 2022 Michigan Achieves!

Research data are the pictures drawn by the children and semi-structured interview records. From the analysis of the students' drawings, three main themes, namely &quot;visual indicator&quot;, &quot;sign&quot;, and &quot;symbol&quot; are identified in this paper. The reasons for the noise in the school are depicted quite well in the student pictures; noise is reflected as a phenomenon that is disturbing, destructive, threatening physiological-psychological health, and negatively affecting social life and learning in school. However, paintings also showed that the children perceived sound and noise as the same concept. Students identified calmness in the classroom with the teacher. Findings suggested that activities should be included to improve the sound and noise awareness of the students at the school, initiate awareness in a school of silence as a shared social value, and physically improve school acoustic quality.",

The working group comprises 20 preschool teachers in kindergartens affiliated with the Ministry of National Education in Konya. The participants were selected by the criterion sampling method, one of the purposive sampling types. The researchers used the semi-structured interview method to collect the data. The data were analyzed using the content analysis method. The research results showed that most preschool teachers &quot;sometimes&quot; use out-of-school learning environments and mostly prefer &quot;factories&quot; as out-of-school learning environments. Moreover, all preschool teachers utilize out-of-school learning environments to conduct &quot;science and nature observation.&quot; Lastly, the most common problem in using out-of-school learning environments was caused by parents. Based on the results, the parents should be informed about the importance of out-of-school learning environments at the beginning of the semester, and their support should be received.",

        "description":"In recent decades, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been at the center of research interest in medicine, psychology, and education. Research has focused on its etiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches. However, there are also many researchers who have focused their interest on teachers' opinions regarding the inclusion of ADHD in standard schools, as ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose primary symptoms are inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity usually causes social and behavioral disorders and learning difficulties. In this research, research data was collected through the quantitative method and the use of an electronic questionnaire in a sample of 160 Special and General Education teachers concerning their opinions, concerns, and feelings regarding the inclusion of students with ADHD in general schools. The results of the research process demonstrate that Special Education Teachers have more positive attitudes and feelings toward the inclusion of children with ADHD in general classes than General Education teachers. Meanwhile, General Education teachers compared to Special Education teachers seem to present more concerns regarding the inclusion of students with ADHD, due to insufficient training and information on special education issues. A fact that seems to agree and confirm the modern research literature. Also, through the research, it was established that demographic data, such as gender and family status, seem to be a factor that affects the attitudes and feelings of teachers towards the inclusion of students with ADHD.",

The method involves inviting students to help plan the professional work of the course instructor, e.g., providing psychotherapy or doing research. The article focuses on the instructor's inviting students to help plan therapy for a client, a teaching method I have used for four years in my Behavior Modification course. I evaluated the effects of the method on self-reported student learning and interest. This past year several students posted suggestions on the course online learning platform. I applied the methods they suggested, while using my own judgment in sessions, and the client achieved her therapy goal. Students who completed an evaluation of the activity found it educational and interesting. Student evaluations of the course were high. The results suggest that the method has positive effects on learning and student interest.

Each chapter, it will be evident, presents not the material for any fixed number of class recitations, but rather a single subject, divisible according to the available time, the capacity of the students, and other practical considerations. The summary and definitions following each lesson may well be used by the teacher to test the students' knowledge of that subject as a whole. Passages printed in brevier are supplementary and subordinate in importance, and hence may be used or omitted at discretion. The questions and exercises are suggestive merely, inviting both modification and supplement by the teacher.

        "description":"Consistency of learning behaviors is known to play an important role in learners' engagement in a course and impact their learning outcomes. Despite significant advances in the area of learning analytics (LA) in measuring various self-regulated learning behaviors, using LA to measure consistency of online course engagement patterns remains largely unexplored. This study focuses on modeling consistency of learners in online courses to address this research gap. Toward this, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm that combines sequence pattern mining and ideas from information retrieval with a clustering algorithm to first extract engagement patterns of learners, represent learners in a vector space of these patterns and finally group them into groups with similar consistency levels. Using clickstream data recorded in a popular learning management system over two offerings of a STEM course, we validate our proposed approach to detect learners that are inconsistent in their behaviors. We find that our method not only groups learners by consistency levels, but also provides reliable instructor support at an early stage in a course.

The article substantiates the expediency of designing such an environment as a prerequisite for the sustainable development of Ukraine. It is established that one of the goals of Ukraine's sustainable development for 2030 is to provide fair quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Green IT is a set of approaches related to sustainable computing and information technology. The work of foreign scientists was analyzed, which considered the issues of designing the learning environment using green computing. As a result, Cloud LMS has been established that cloud LMS is a type of green IT and can serve as a tool for designing a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment of a higher education institution. A model of a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment of a higher education institution using cloud LMS is proposed. The application of a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment will provide such capabilities: keep electronic journals; use on-line services; conduct correspondence, assessment of knowledge on-line; and more. And all of the above is the key to a sustainable development of the learning environment. [Paper presented at ICSF (2020).]",

Although scholars have organized and prioritized different dimensions of temperament, in this chapter we focus on temperament dimensions that are most salient to--and how they are exhibited in--early childhood classrooms. Temperament continues to be an important topic in early childhood classrooms because it is both important for children learning to manage their social emotional competence, which relates to long-term academic success and positive mental health, and for teachers to develop classroom management skills that provide a positive climate for an array of children and temperament types. After introducing the notion of temperament, we describe how teachers may create environments and react to children in ways that support child temperament. Finally, &quot;INSIGHTS into Children's Temperament,&quot; an empirically based social-emotional intervention, will be introduced. This intervention focuses on how children's temperament unfolds in the classroom and how the adults in children's lives can create &quot;goodness-of-fit&quot; for optimal outcomes.",

It is a method of reasoning so very short, subtle, solid, and certain, and likewise so useful in all parts of the mathematics, that it is impossible to make the least progress without it. It is the marrow of the mathematics, and the very soul of geometry and geometrical reasoning. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that every one who expects to succeed in his mathematical studies, should make himself acquainted with the nature of reasoning with proportional quantities, and become ready and quick in the use thereof. Section 1 treats of arithmetical proportion and progression, Section 2 of geometrical proportion, and Section 3 of general proportions.

        "description":"It is the purpose of the author of this work to give to the Youth of the country, as well as general readers, a condensed History of the United States of America; embracing all important facts connected with the discovery and early occupation of the country, within their limits, by immigrants from other lands; together with the facts attending the formation of their Governments, and the establishment of those free institutions which have so marked, as well as distinguished them, among the nations of the earth. In the prosecution of this design, the first object will be, after a brief presentation of the facts attending the discovery of the continent of America, to trace, during their Colonial condition, the History of each one of the separate political Communities known as British Colonies thereon, which afterwards became united under the style of the United States of America, and then to trace the History of these States, so united under their existing Union, down to the present time. The first part of the work will be the History of the Colonies, which will treat of the discovery, the early settlement, and colonization of the country by the ancestors of the present inhabitants, and the events which led to the assumption of sovereign or absolute self-governing powers by the respective Colonies. The second part will be the History of the States, which treat of the achievement and establishment of their independence as States, and their subsequent career under their present Federal Union.",

Achievement gaps are defined as the differences in scores between students at the 90th percentile of performance (high-performing) and those at the 10th percentile of performance (low-performing); they are also known as &quot;score gaps.&quot; The SiB focuses on two questions for each grade and subject: (1) In which education systems did score gaps between high- and low-performing students change (widen or narrow) between 2011 and 2019? (2) Is the widening or narrowing of score gaps between 2011 and 2019 driven primarily by changes in the scores of high-performing students, low-performing students, or both?",

While stating in simple language some elementary facts in anatomy and physiology, especial attention has been given to rules for the preservation of health. A careful search for the cause of the physical ills of adult life reveals the fact that much of the suffering is the result of repeated violations of hygienic laws early in life. It is no mitigation of these ills that the laws are violated through ignorance; but the fact that most of the violations occur from lack of knowledge furnishes a potent reason for training the young with great care. By earnestly presenting the simple truths as laid down in the text of this little book, teachers can exert an influence for good which will be both valuable and permanent. The reward of such effort will be the highest, the development of a wiser, more temperate, and more moral people.",

        "description":"Research has demonstrated strong relations between spatial skill and mathematics across ages and in both typical and atypical populations, suggesting that a significant proportion of variance in mathematics performance can be explained by variance in spatial skill. Why do these relations exist and how do they develop? Studies of dimensionality in the two domains suggest the relation holds across tasks and is not limited to specific spatial or mathematics subskills. Spatial skills might perform several functions in real-time problem solving, but these have not been differentiated empirically. The relation appears to be based on automatic shared processing, as well as strategic recruitment of spatial processes. Developmentally, the relation is consistent in its strength, but may change qualitatively, particularly in response to novel mathematics content.

This employed a mixed method of research. Initially, a self-assessment survey questionnaire was used to determine the basic science process skills of the 20 Grade 8 student-respondents. From the results, alternative laboratory experiments were developed and validated. Validated ALEs were given to the same group of respondents. At the same time, acceptability questionnaire was administered to the 21 teacher-respondents comprising the total population of science 8 teachers in the Division of Lucena City. The teachers highly accepted that the ALEs promote holistic development in all the three (3) learning domains, cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. To evaluate the improvement of the students' basic SPS, an individual in-depth interview was conducted. Qualitative analysis of the students' basic SPS revealed that the learners who utilized the ALE improved their skills. As perceived by students, they became mindful of the process of observation, execute alternative way of quantifying data and materials, identify the cause and effect, and use related observations, look closely at the properties and characteristics, made the good prediction based on recorded data, and improve in presenting data and explaining results. Therefore, the developed material in selected contents for Chemistry 8 that can improve the target learners' basic science process skills is ready for utilization in the home school scheme.",

This investigation sought to characterize engagement in these behaviors in U.S. adults early during the pandemic and to build explanatory models of the psychological processes that drive them. Methods: US adults were recruited through Qualtrics Research Panels (N = 324; 55% female; M[subscript age] = 50.91, SD = 15.98) and completed 10 days of online reports of emotion, COVID-19 perceived susceptibility and worry, and recommended behaviors (social distancing, hand washing, etc.). Factor analysis revealed behaviors loaded on two factors suggesting distinct motivational orientations: approach and avoidance. Results: Changes in approach and avoidance behaviors over the 10 days indicated large individual differences consistent with three types of participants. Discrete emotions, including fear, guilt/shame, and happiness were associated with more recommended behaviors. Fear and COVID-19 worry indirectly influenced each other to facilitate more behavioral engagement. While emotions and worry strongly predicted individual differences in behavior across the 10 days, they did not predict as well why behaviors occurred on one day versus another. Conclusions: These findings suggest how daily affective processes motivate behavior, improving the understanding of compliance and efforts to target behaviors as primary prevention of disease.",

        "description":"In contrast to prior federally mandated school reforms, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) allows states more discretion in reforming their lowest performing schools, removes requirements to disrupt the status quo, and does not allocate substantial additional funds. Using a regression discontinuity design, we evaluate a state turnaround initiative aligned with ESSA requirements. We find the effect on student achievement was not significant in year one and -0.13 in year two. Also, in year two, we find that teachers in turnaround schools were 22.5 percentage points more likely to turn over. While the increased teacher turnover in NCT schools in 2017 opens the possibility that reform schools were intentionally replacing less effective teachers with more effective ones, our analysis does not support that strategic staffing occurred. The negative effects on student achievement appear related to variable timing of implementation of one of the few required components for serving low-performing schools under ESSA--a comprehensive needs assessment which leads to comprehensive school improvement plans. These findings may serve as a cautionary tale for states planning low-performing school reforms under ESSA.

        "author":["Al-Jarf, Reima"],
        "description":"This study investigates grade inflation in 127 language, linguistics, translation, education, and computer courses taught at some Saudi universities before, during and after the Pandemic. Grades obtained from some instructors for courses taught over 8 semesters were analyzed. It was found that between 20% 65% chose a pass/no-grade results, the rest of the students mostly earned A &amp; B grades in Spring 2020 when instruction and assessment were held online compared to students' grade in Fall 2018, Spring 2018, Fall 2019, and after the Pandemic (in Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021, Spring 2022). Grade inflation was the highest in computer courses followed by education courses and was the least in language, linguistics, and translation courses. Grade inflation in Spring 2020 was due to the adjustments mandated by universities to alleviate students' anxiety caused by the sudden shift to online teaching and assessment. Universities allocated 20% of the course marks to final exams, gave alternatives to a written final and to be lenient in grading. Students had the option to drop the course or have a pass with no-grade result. In Fall 2020, classes were still held online but exams were held on campus. Starting Fall 2021, both instruction and exams were held on campus. Mark distribution and exam requirements went back to normal as before the Pandemic. However, grade inflation continued in many courses even in Spring 2022. The study gives recommendations for maintaining exam reliability, validity, and fairness in emergency and normal situations to achieve the desired learning outcomes",

The primary design of this treatise is to teach common field surveying; at the same time it contains the elements of surveying upon a larger scale; and the system of geometry and trigonometry with which it is introduced, with the problems for the mensuration of superficies, as also the mathematical tables at the end, will be found useful for many other purposes.",

        "description":"Help-seeking is an essential tool for student success. Still, students, especially those underrepresented in STEM (UR-STEM) and those underrepresented in chemistry (UR-Chem), may be reluctant to employ help-seeking for academic success. Understanding help-seeking in online courses is crucial for developing equitable learning environments where students can engage with a community of inquiry. We analyzed help-seeking behaviors and responses to requests for help in an online college-level chemistry course's discussion forum. We found that requests for help were responded to equally, regardless of how explicitly students appealed for help. Furthermore, we found that UR-Chem students requested and responded to help similarly and received help at greater rates than their non-UR-Chem peers. Results support that productive and substantive help-seeking and help-giving discussions occur in an online discussion forum. Ultimately this work highlights a necessary learning skill, help-seeking, thereby informing chemistry instruction and learning.

        "description":"Undoubtedly, it is every teacher's life quest to find the best way to teach; there are no universal formulas to accomplish that. A committed teacher is a life-long learner, which shows why being an educator is not an easy career. A teacher is indeed like a candle that lights the students' path as it consumes itself. Such abnegation comes at a high price. Particularly, English teachers in a Country such as Costa Rica are faced with various challenges, ranging from deeply ingrained negative attitudes towards teachers and the education system itself, their own well-being which tends to be neglected a little too often, unequal access to resources and teaching materials, heterogeneous student populations, emotional factors in the classroom, among many others. An English teacher in a developing country (and probably elsewhere) has to be prepared to deal with the unexpected, learn, relearn, and unlearn, and whenever something new is learned, it is every (English) teacher's duty to share it using different means; getting published is but one way to do so. This ebook comprises a collection of essays written by students from the Master's Program in Education with an Emphasis on English Learning from Universidad Nacional, Costa Rica as part of their graduation project. In each of the manuscripts contained here, a Costa Rican English teacher reflects on some of his or her educational experiences and encountered challenges and proposes strategies to tackle them so that any English teachers out there facing similar situations may benefit from these ideas. [This book was published by the Centro de Investigación y Docencia en Educación (CIDE) Universidad Nacional, Costa Rica. It is provided in the format of an e-book.]",

        "description":"Critical consciousness (CC) scholarship frames how more marginalized people deeply analyze, feel empowered to change, and take collective action to redress perceived inequities. These three dimensions of CC correspond to critical reflection, motivation, and action, respectively. This paper aims to re-center action in CC scholarship, given the disproportionate attention that has been paid to reflection. To achieve this aim, this paper (a) reviews empirical associations between critical action and positive developmental consequences among more marginalized youth (b) highlights promising practices to foster critical action, and (c) notes open questions and key areas for future inquiry. Our hope is that this paper serves as a call to action, to re-center critical action in CC scholarship, policy, and practice.

        "description":"&quot;A Millionaire at Sixteen&quot; is the second volume of the &quot;All-Over-the-World&quot; series; and while the book may be read independently of the first, it is the continuation of the adventures of Louis Belgrave, who was presented to the reader in the preceding story. After the first volume, the author hopes to not be accused with being unnecessarily liberal to his hero, in supplying him with &quot;the missing million,&quot; even augmented to nearly half as much more, so that he is actually a millionaire and a half; but the present story will assure such critics that even this vast sum was necessary in carrying out the purpose of the writer. But no one need tremble for his moral safety, for he will find that the young man in his moneyed abundance is well guarded by his &quot;guardian-mother,&quot; and by his prudent and conservative trustee. The magnificent steam-yacht, the purchase of which required the figure at which the fortune of the hero was placed, was not obtained for sporting and pleasure uses. He was actuated by the very highest of motives in consenting to buy the yacht, and, in fact, it seemed to him to be his duty to do so. His mother, whom he almost worships, is borne away from him over the ocean, and the steamer seemed to him and his advisers the only means by which he could recover her, and restore her to her friends. With such an object in view, money was hardly to be considered. The writer still holds to his belief set forth in the preceding volume that exciting incidents do not corrupt or mislead the minds and hearts of young people, and he still keeps his hero above reproach morally; and his magnificent venture is intended to promote his education, to make him a wise and good man. He has no vices, and under the system of his nautical friend, he is not likely to acquire any.",

The author would state in a single sentence that his aim has been to set forth, in the light of the latest linguistic scholarship, the etymology and the syntax of the English language--to make a logical, systematic, and well-ordered presentation of this great subject, with a view both to intellectual development, or wit-sharpening, and to the attainment of a fair mastery of the art of speaking and writing our tongue. Very great care has been taken to make it a working class-book; and particular attention is called to the summaries, topical analyses, and written reviews. For the higher study of English, in its historical and comparative aspects, a good amount of material will be found in the Appendix. The book is in three parts: (1) Etymology; (2) Syntax; and (3) Analysis.",

It is the authors' belief that the manual as well as the text-book should be based on practical physics. The method is to give, first, a fundamental experiment in which the principle under consideration is made clear to the student, then to follow this with an experiment or a number of experiments on the practical applications of that principle. The authors have divided the index of experiments into three groups as follows: The first, known as the General Course, comprises the entire list, all fundamental experiments (56 in number) being printed in bold-faced type, and forming by themselves a group sufficiently large to prepare students for any college. The instructor may then select from the rest of the list such as suit the needs of his school or equipment. The second group is known as the Technical Course. It consists of the fundamental experiments and in addition others specially designed for boys preparing for the technical trades or for engineering. The third group, known as Household Physics, is designed for girls. It includes almost all the fundamental experiments and in addition a great many of household application for the benefit of that great majority of girls who take physics, not for technical purposes, but from a desire to understand household problems.",

An attempt has been made to draw the portraiture of every important historical character, and to include in a rapid and condensed narrative all the chief transactions, whether political, military, or ecclesiastical, which have marked the varying fortunes of the nation. Many of the most interesting questions connected with the history, government, and institutions of the country are discussed at considerable length in the &quot;Notes and Illustrations,&quot; which, it is believed, will be found of great service to the student. Copious references to the best authorities are likewise given, with the view of assisting him in prosecuting farther inquiries. It has been the earnest endeavor of the Author to avoid the capital error of writing the History of France from an English point of view, a course which can not fail to convey an unjust conception of the institutions, government, habits, and character of the people.",

        "description":"Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is an international comparative study designed to measure trends in mathematics and science achievement at grades 4 and 8, as well as to collect information about educational contexts (such as students' schools, teachers, and homes) that may be related to student achievement. TIMSS has been administered every 4 years since 1995, with the seventh and most recent administration, in 2019, providing a 24-year trend line. The United States has participated in every administration of TIMSS, which includes 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019 for the eighth grade and all but 1999 for the fourth grade (when it was not administered internationally). TIMSS is designed to align broadly with mathematics and science curricula in the participating education systems and, therefore, to reflect students' school-based learning. Because it is an international study, TIMSS provides valuable benchmarking information on how U.S. students compare to students around the world. The U.S. TIMSS 2019 Technical Report and User's Guide provides an overview of the design and implementation of TIMSS 2019 in the United States and includes guidance for researchers using the U.S. datasets. Part 2 contains Appendix D: TIMSS 2019 Questionnaires. Part 3 contains Appendix E: TIMSS 2019 Questionnaire Adaptations and Appendix F: U.S. TIMSS 2019 Nonresponse Bias Analysis.

We conducted a survey across many undergraduate courses in engineering and computing at the University of Illinois to identify course components that engage students with and without disabilities. We were motivated to find not only opportunities for future course improvements for all students but also greater equity for students with disabilities. Therefore in the survey, we asked for both students' disability and demographics info and their usability and satisfaction with more than ten types of course modalities including live Zoom lectures, recordings of lectures, small group discussions, instructor notes, transcripts of lecture videos, discussion boards, etc. The study spanned 13 different departments with a total enrollment of 1800 students during Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. Preliminary results from 303 responses from 49 different courses showed that students with disabilities preferred recorded lectures videos with transcripts, course textbook and instructor notes/slides that they could engage with offline, while students without disabilities were more satisfied with office hours and lecture videos in addition to lecture notes. In addition, female students appeared to be less satisfied with instructor Powerpoint slides, live Zoom lectures and discussion/lab sessions than male students. These results demonstrated the importance of multiple resources, supporting Universal Design Principles.",

        "description":"Post-completion success for Latino students is a conscious campus conversation that is gaining traction and support in a growing number of institutions. Excelencia in Education collaborated and partnered with seven Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in exploring and examining post-completion success efforts. When looking across the post-completion success narratives, Excelencia identified three strengths that demonstrate the cohort's efforts to advance post-completion success efforts with the intention to serve Latino completers. These institutions showed strengths in: (1) Offering culturally relevant institutional practices designed to accelerate Latino post-completion success; (2) Providing custom measures and metrics to track post-completion success outcomes; and (3) Demonstrating progress in closing post-completion success equity gaps for Latino completers. The institutions were also asked to share questions and areas of opportunity within their respective institutions. Referencing these items, Excelencia identified three main areas of growth that institutions considered in their post-completion success efforts. These institutions seek to: (1) Deepen their knowledge of data collection efforts and align measures to track post-completion success in both the short and long term; (2) Forge intentional connections with employers and industries looking to diversify their employment pool; and (3) Make the case to institutional leadership for intentionally serving completers at their institution. This brief outlines evolving approaches and discussions to post-completion success and summarizes where institutions are in their efforts to better understand post-completion success at their respective institutions.",

        "description":"The Iowa Department of Education (Department) collects information on developmental education (dev. ed.) from Iowa's 15 community colleges on an annual basis. Dev. ed. courses are offered in mathematics, reading, writing, English as a Second Language (ESL), and in other subject areas, such as financial literacy and skill building. These credits do not count toward degrees, but typically must be completed by students who are assessed as needing additional academic preparation before advancing to transfer-level courses. Dev. ed. is important to the mission of the comprehensive community college and is a critical factor in meeting the state's Future Ready Iowa (FRI) goal, which calls for 70 percent of Iowans to have education or training beyond high school by 2025. Because effective dev. ed. programs are essential to maintaining Iowa's community college commitment to open-access, highquality education for all, it is necessary to understand the students served and to analyze the data regarding their success. This report provides data on student demographics, course enrollment, credit hours taken, and success metrics as reported by colleges in the Department's Management Information System (MIS) by fiscal year (FY) for student data before 2016-17, and academic year (AY) for student data starting in 2016-17. In this report, first-time in college (FTIC), non-high school students are followed from their cohort years 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-2020 to establish both dev. ed. statistics and outcome trends. This report also shares course success statistics such as persistence and retention data for all cohorts, as well as graduation and transfer &quot;success&quot; outcomes for the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 cohorts. Future reports will include these outcome metrics for additional cohorts once they have been tracked for three full years. [For the 2020 report, see ED617622.]",

This manual is designed as a working book, and hence discards both the high-flown narrative style and the meaningless details of the majority of school histories. The text will derive its interest from the lucid presentation of the subject-matter, in itself deeply interesting. The technical points of novelty and superiority which the author thinks he may fairly claim as the justification of this manual will be evident to all practical teachers. Some of these points are: (1) A plan of clear and concise paragraphing, by which the gist of each paragraph is readily apprehended by the pupil; (2) A total absence of involved, inverted, or in anywise rhetorical sentences, and the use, in lieu thereof, of the direct, concise, and recitable construction; (3) A new method of Topical Reviews; (4) The separation of the history of the Northwestern, Southwestern, and Pacific States from its entanglement in the history of the Administrations; and (5) The separation of the leading facts of American Progress from their entanglement in the history of the Administrations, and their presentation in a section by themselves.",

The French treatises furnish excellent models of the theory of Algebra, the German of ingenuity and brevity of notation and exposition, the English of practical adaptation and variety of illustration and example; and from these, after a careful comparison of many authors in each language, demonstrations have been selected and introduced verbatim when they seemed incapable of improvement; but when ever the slightest alteration or amalgamation, or the entire remodeling of them, could give additional clearness or elegance, the labor has not been spared. The work will be found to contain all that is important in the higher parts of Algebra, upon which usually separate treatises are thought necessary, as well as the elementary expositions suited to beginners. Every variety of symbol and of example has been introduced. Those articles of this volume which constitute a minimum course of Algebra requisite for the prosecution of the higher branches of mathematics are indicated. A more extended course, such as would ordinarily be advisable, is also pointed out. The rest may very well be reserved for reference, as the student's own discovery of his wants, in the advanced stages of mathematical pursuit, shall call it in requisition.",

COVID-19 raised a lot of discussions already occurring around school choice, which connects to a larger conversation on the purpose of education and it being one of the most important public goods in American society. Yet, efforts to prioritize school choice and further privatization only increased during COVID-19, despite it bringing to the surface a deep-seated crisis we are facing when it comes to providing equitable access and opportunity in education. Thus, this brief also discusses how the notion of education as a public good has waned over time, particularly in recent presidential administrations, which is contributing to many of the struggles experienced during COVID-19, particularly during its onset. The brief concludes by discussing the need for the new approaches to school integration in the current educational context and offer examples of how center equity can be bettered in such approaches.",

Traditionally, MTSS includes three tiers. Tier 1 refers to universal supports that are system-, school-, or classwide; tier 2 includes targeted services beyond general supports; and tier 3 and beyond provide intensive and sustained individualized services. Although equity is identified as a feature or outcome of MTSS, particularly when considered in the context of prevention of racial disproportionality through MTSS, the authors propose that equity should be more foundational to MTSS design, implementation, and evaluation in order to advance social justice and protect student rights. As such, this &quot;Equity by Design&quot; brief introduces an expanded conceptualization of equity-centered MTSS, describes its key features, provides guided questions to evaluate an existing MTSS system, and identifies resources to support this work.",

The authors examine state plans and guidance for reopening schools across states in the Midwest &amp; Plains Equity Assistance Center (MAP EAC) region which includes the 13 states of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The purpose of this paper is to provide explicit consideration of equity issues in the context of reopening schools and generate discussion about the topics addressed. The following topics are covered: (1) time spent in face-to-face instruction vs. virtual or hybrid learning environments and any calendar changes; (2) screening and reporting of COVID-19 symptoms and exposure; (3) social distancing, face masks and classroom set up; (4) ensuring more equitable learning for students with dis/abilities and multilingual learners; (5) access to technology; (6) opportunities and challenges in online learning, (7) communication with parent/caregivers; (8) addressing learning loss; (9) guidance on Social Emotional Learning (SEL); and (10) guidance on field trips and co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. Throughout this brief, the authors highlight equity issues that inevitably arise in the context of schooling where conditions of access are likely exacerbated by the pandemic and how one might approach and consider these issues in planning and policy. As school and district leaders review and revise policy implementation, the guidance outlined in this paper can inform the way that policy is implemented and can help highlight issues around equity that district and school personnel may not have considered in planning for reopening.",

The Lifelong Learning Tendency scale developed by Coskun (2009) to determine the lifelong learning tendencies of primary education teachers was used to collect data. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed that the scale in both the original study and this study had four factors. In addition, the Cronbach Alpha coefficient was 0.90. The data displayed a normal distribution in the dimensions of motivation and persistence, but a non-normal distribution in the dimensions of lack of regulating learning and lack of curiosity. The results revealed that participants have high tendencies towards pursuing lifelong learning. In particular, the tendencies in the motivation dimension were the highest. A significant relationship was only found in the dimension of lack of curiosity with female participants. It was determined that the lifelong learning tendencies of primary education teachers do not differ significantly according to grade level, education level, or professional seniority.",

The tool collected detailed timestamped student behavioral data from 1,894 students across 25 engineering courses that included what individual students searched for and when. A previous analysis, published in ASEE 2020 [1], found that using ClassTranscribe caption search significantly predicted improvement in final exam scores in a computer science course. In this paper we present how students used the search functionality based on a more detailed analysis of the log data. ClassTranscribe automatically created captions and transcripts for all lecture videos using an Azure speech-to-text system that was supplemented with crowd-sourced editing to fix captioning errors. The search functionality used the timestamped caption data to find specific video moments both within the current video or across the entire course. The number of search activities per person ranged from zero to 186 events. An in-depth analysis of the students (N=167) who performed 1,022 searches was conducted to gain insight into student search needs and behaviors. Based on the total number of searches performed, students were grouped into &quot;Infrequent Searcher&quot; (&lt; 18 searches) and &quot;Frequent Searcher&quot; (18 to 110 searches) using clustering algorithms. The search queries used by each group were found to follow the Zipf's Law and were categorized into STEM-related terms, course logistics and others. Our study reports on students' search context, behaviors, strategies, and optimizations. Using Universal Design for Learning as a foundation, we discuss the implications for educators, designers, and developers who are interested in providing new learning pathways to support and enhance video-based learning environments.",

We reviewed 14 meta-analyses and systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies published in the last decade that examined the effects of reading and writing interventions in the elementary grades, including research focused on students with reading difficulties and disabilities, including dyslexia. We attended to moderator analyses, when available, to further refine what we know and need to learn about interventions. Findings from these reviews indicate that explicit and systematic intervention focusing on the code &quot;and&quot; meaning dimensions of reading and writing, and delivered one-to-one or in small groups, are likely to improve foundational code-based reading skills, and to a lesser extent, meaning-based skills, across elementary grade levels. Findings, at least in the upper elementary grades, indicate that some intervention features including standardized protocols, multiple components, and longer duration can yield stronger effects. And, integrating reading and writing interventions shows promise. We still need to learn more about specific instructional routines and components that provide more robust effects on students' ability to comprehend and individual differences in response to interventions. We discuss limitations of this review of reviews and suggest directions for future research to optimize implementation, particularly to understand &quot;for whom&quot; and &quot;under what conditions&quot; literacy interventions work best.",

Some results have suggested that bilingual children have an advantage over their monolingual peers in development of ToM. However, there is less research regarding the predictive role of ToM in performance of oral and reading comprehension in elementary school students. This study evaluated a sample of 84 emergent bilingual, Spanish-speaking, third to fifth graders to identify the predictive role of ToM in their oral comprehension and reading comprehension in English, their second language, controlling for grade, vocabulary, and word identification. ToM was assessed using a test of other people's intentions, beliefs, and perspectives, along with recognition of emotions through facial expressions. For comprehension, standardized measures of oral and reading comprehension were used. The bivariate correlations and hierarchical linear regression analyses between ToM and each of the types of comprehension indicated a prediction of ToM in both types of comprehension when controlling statistically for grade, word identification, and vocabulary. This highlights the role of ToM in oral language and reading variables in emergent bilingual students and emphasizes its importance for teaching of reading for this population.",

        "description":"In this article, we review approaches to modeling a connection between spatial and mathematical thinking across development. We critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of factor analyses, meta-analyses, and experimental literatures. We examine those studies that set out to describe the nature and number of spatial and mathematical skills and specific connections between these abilities, especially those that included children as participants. We also find evidence of strong spatial-mathematical connections and transfer from spatial interventions to mathematical understanding. Finally, we map out the kinds of studies that could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which spatial and mathematical processing are connected and the principles by which mathematical outcomes could be enhanced through spatial training in educational settings.

        "author":["Lee, Jeong-Kyu"],
        "description":"This article is to explore whether the achievement of moral character is the ultimate goal of higher education from a cross cultural approach. To discuss this study logically, three major research questions are addressed. First, what are the concepts of moral, ethics, and character? Second, what is the achievement of moral character from the Eastern and the Western perspectives? Third, what is the role of higher education for the achievement of moral character? To defend these research questions, the author uses a descriptive content analysis method, with a cross cultural approach. In order to explore the questions, the researcher in this study sets several limitations. Moral character is generally limited to the ancient Greek philosophy and Judeo-Christianity as well as to the classical Chinese thought and religion. Specifically, the study is mainly focused on not only Plato's &quot;Republic&quot; and Aristotle's &quot;Nicomachean Ethics,&quot; but Confucius' &quot;Analects&quot; and Mencius' &quot;Scripture (The Works of Mengzi).&quot; Additionally, this paper also adjusts the lenses on moral theories, especially moral character, cardinal virtues, social harmony, and the common good. Lastly, higher education is focused on the lenses of Canada and South Korea. The significance of this study is to provide basic theories and valuable resources about moral and character education for educational theorists and practitioners, finding the theories of moral and ethics in the Eastern and the Western thoughts and religions.",

This document is intended to help counselors, educators, and others with roles in various parts of students' transition from high school to postsecondary education to be on 'the same page.' In this document, the authors distinguish their advice into four categories or themes--Preparation, Recruitment, Retention, and Transfer. In each case, it is worth having high school teachers, counselors, and students know more about what can come next, including possible pitfalls that might be encountered by an SOC if/when they make it to higher education only to encounter a setting that seems unprepared to fully welcome them and/or otherwise retain them so that their studies culminate in earning associates and/or bachelors degrees. A key list of terms and additional resources for students and families are included.

Both fields also attract interdisciplinary teams and create strikingly similar knowledge across contexts. However, key differences have emerged in these two fields of study and the assumptions they make in the empirical work. These differences provide opportunities to strengthen the next generation of both implementation science and research on research use. In this report, the authors highlight how similarities and differences in the methods, approaches, and evolution of each of these fields can contribute to mutually beneficial insights and potential alignments. They describe each field in detail, with an eye toward highlighting key assumptions and differences, and we conclude by discussing opportunities for learning across fields.

        "description":"Educational inequality is a long-standing and persistent challenge. Never has this inequality been more evident than during the COVID-19 era. The pandemic put existing divisions into sharp relief, and made them worse. Recent evidence tells a terrible story of the consequences of the pandemic--and the response of the education system to the pandemic--for educational inequality. Today, as the pandemic recedes, its effects are still there, in education as well as in other domains. Fortunately, there is considerable knowledge about how to respond to growing inequality. As the authors explain in this report, they have learned through research that effective responses include high-quality tutoring, effective expanded learning time, and strengthened relationships between learners and educators. Yet many questions remain, and new research is needed to help ensure that our education system not only overcomes the increase in inequality induced by the pandemic, but reduces the inequality that was already in place prior to 2020. In this report, the authors discuss the consequences of the pandemic for educational inequality, examine research-based strategies for responding to inequality, and identify new areas for research that can take everyone further down the road to an equitable education system.",

        "description":"The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction (NDDPI) is committed to providing guidance and support for high school faculty, staff, and administrators to ensure clear pathways to graduation. Many high school students face challenges in accrual and recovery of credit towards graduation. Class offerings, credit calculation, and course requirements for graduation can vary across districts within North Dakota. Students who continuously change schools or face personal health and family issues are among those greatly affected. Earning and recovering credits is critical to keeping students in school, advancing towards graduation, higher education and, ultimately, financial stability, civic engagement, and independence. This &quot;Credit Accrual and Recovery Guidance&quot; will keep learning aspirations high for current high school students and will help protect students' future success in changing times. This guidance provides educators with ideas to enhance opportunities for students to meet graduation requirements and remain on track to graduate with their respective class or cohort group. This guidance is also intended to clarify available options that exist for districts as they work to ensure all students can complete a pathway toward graduation.",

In both propensity score matching (pre-processing) and multiple regression analysis, the study controlled for baseline performance, grade level, and key school and student characteristics. Results revealed statistically significant larger gains among IXL schools relative to comparable non-IXL schools over the course of a three-year intervention in grades 3-8. Thus, the study not only built upon the large body of extant evidence supporting the efficacy of IXL Math, but it also did so using methodology that meets the requirements for ESSA Tier 2 (moderate evidence) as well as WWC standards with reservations. Last but not least, this study provided a formal evaluation of the benefits of a three-year intervention. An independent review determined that the study meets the requirements for ESSA Tier 2 and WWC standards with reservations (see Mislevy, Seftor, &amp; Wei, 2021).

The study was conducted in a large urban Title I school district in Texas where the majority of the population falls into a lower socioeconomic group. The guiding question states, &quot;Can hunger caused by food insecurity cause high school students, specifically seniors, to have a low participation rate in extracurricular activities?&quot; The baseline data was collected around the socioeconomic status of the focus district. This data was cross-referenced with the qualitative student self-report survey data from a sample of 34 high school seniors who attended the focus district. The study found that the subject group surveyed were less likely to participate in extracurricular activities and as an average only participated in .08 of these activities per high school senior. The state average is 2 extracurricular activities per high school senior. Within the focus group, students who were food insecure were less likely to participate in extracurricular activities than students who were not food insecure and that hunger had a negative impact on student participation in extracurricular activities and academic performance.",

Teaching practicum experience is one of the major opportunities for prospective teachers to advance their understanding about the profession. Colleges of Teacher Education in Ethiopia have generally given credibility to the student-teaching experiences. These experiences seem to be exciting, empowering and stimulating in many ways. However, the student-teaching experiences were also characteristically filled with lots of challenges beginning from the orientation program to the field supervision process and prost-student-teaching activities. Yet, these experiences have never been examined and lessons not extracted so far. This study employs a qualitative research design particularly phenomenological approach. The participants of this study were 20 composed of 12 prospective teachers, 6 teacher educators and 2 officers. For the sake of reliable data, all of the participants were selected purposively. Findings of this study reveal that even though pre-orientation is given, there is no post-practicum conference. Practicum materials for pre-primary teacher training is not relevant to the program nature. The supervision trend and support provision is not well- organized. Both trainees and tutors face scarcity of transportation while conducting practicum. Time allotment, trainee assignment, mentor assignment, language of instruction and assessment technique still requires to be aligned with the purpose of the program. Researchers suggest that the participation of properly trained professionals should be considered in the process of framework development.",

Learning emerges from rapidly-changing experiences and high-intensity social interactions, which requires instruction to continually adapt. These adaptations vary in content and impact, possibly improving quality or undermining fidelity (Hill &amp; Erickson, 2020; LeMahieu, 2011; O'Donnell, 2008; Penuel &amp; Means, 2004). As a field, administrators need to improve not just the quality of research evidence (Ming &amp; Goldenberg, 2021), but also the quality of research use and the processes supporting effective implementation of evidence-based practices. Whether framed as a problem of practice or research use, understanding implementation is critical for identifying and redressing the inequitable distribution of resources, facilitators, and barriers in systems, which give rise to disparities in student outcomes.",

A key component of creating the dashboard was knowing the large and varied group of exercise stakeholders' requirements for learning analytics and associated visualizations. Therefore, we collected data from 263 stakeholders through interviews and surveys at Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) conferences and meetings, asking about their understanding and experience with learning analytics and the type of analysis and visualizations they want to see. This report presents the analysis of detailed feedback from exercise stakeholders concerning their requirements for learning analytics and associated visualizations.

        "description":"In the city of Milwaukee, the vast majority of students do not achieve both high school and college graduation which has been termed as a &quot;completion crisis.&quot; This is negatively impacting not only those students but also the region's workforce challenges. Indeed, the area economy could suffer greatly unless metro Milwaukee leaders can develop strategies to increase the home-grown talent needed to fill the increasing number of vacant skilled positions created by retiring Baby Boomers and to fulfill the region's broader economic development objectives. A way to combat this situation is the multitude of out-of-school programming efforts that have been created to provide support and interventions for Milwaukee teens. While efforts like these are laudable, those who are administering them may find it difficult to take stock of others engaged in this work and to pursue appropriate coordination and collaboration. Meanwhile, philanthropic supporters of these efforts, school-based staff, and other stakeholders seeking to connect families to services also would benefit from greater awareness of the range of out-of-school efforts to improve college readiness in Milwaukee. This report was commissioned to provide greater clarity on key characteristics of this landscape--from student needs to available services to sources of funding. This report summarizes the findings from quantitative research, surveys solicited from out-of-school programming providers, and interviews with key informants to address the following questions: (1) Which organizations are providing formal out-of-school postsecondary readiness and success programming for Milwaukee youth, and who are they serving? (2) What specific programming are they providing? (3) How are these programs funded, and are they competing with one another for public or philanthropic resources? (4) Is the supply of these programs meeting the potential demand? (5) What do we know about the strengths and challenges of these programs? and (6) How well aligned or positioned are these programs vis-à-vis overlaps, gaps, and expansion opportunities? [For the executive summary, see ED628141. This report was commissioned by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Milwaukee and the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce (MMAC).

This new analysis by the Wisconsin Policy Forum lends credence to those concerns, revealing that fewer than half of graduates from public high schools in Milwaukee are enrolling in college immediately after high school completion. In addition, just one third of enrollees at regional colleges graduate with a degree within the expected time frame. In response to these shortcomings, a multitude of programs operating outside the traditional school system has arisen over the years to support youth in their pursuit of higher education. This study first provides a quantitative analysis of the data and trends that suggest the need for such programming, and then examines the characteristics of this programming landscape and potential opportunities for improvement. These findings show that some youth are likely underserved by the existing offerings and that ensuring greater coordination and a closer alignment between programs and student needs could help more Milwaukee students to enroll in and graduate from a postsecondary institution.

The career-oriented learning experiences can be gained through effective e-internship programs that involve three levels of collaboration, including organizational level, departmental level, and instructor level. Notably, an overly focus on early workplace learning experiences might run the risk of excessive vocational curriculum design so that the 'higher' education aspect was cast off. Therefore, an integrated eLearning curriculum development should consider fostering 'full-stack' students who possess the necessary skills for academic and professional success. In essence, technical training should complement academic education to create an integrated and comprehensive e-learning curriculum.

A corpus of English and Arabic numeral-based formulaic expressions containing zero, two, three, twenty, sixty, hundred, thousand…etc., and another corpus of specialized expressions with numerical prefixes (mono-, bi-, milli-, kilo-, mega-) were collected, analyzed and compared. It was found that English and Arabic numeral-based formulaic expressions fall into 4 categories:: (i) those that are identical in form and meaning in both languages (seventh heaven, four eyes, fifth column); (ii) those that are similar in meaning but differ in wording (cats have nine lives, high five, cloud nine); (iii) those that exist in English, but have no equivalents in Arabic; and (iv) those that exist in Arabic but have no equivalents in English. Specialized expressions containing numerals or numerical prefixes used in business, sports, science, politics and others are exact translations in both languages (five-power agreement, five percent rule, five tigers, tripartite alliance, fifth wheel replace). Student-translators could translate fewer than 25% of the test items correctly and left many blank. Numeral-based formulaic expressions similar in both languages were easy to translate, whereas opaque ones (at sixes and sevens, double Dutch, strap); culture-specific ones (Pentateuch, Millennialism, [special characters omitted], and those that require a specialized background knowledge (five C's, the big five, five pillars of the UN, three-name paper) were difficult. Literal translation was the most common translation strategy. Detailed results and recommendations are given.",

These sets of skills are obtained over an individual's lifespan, but the acquisition of these skills is highly regarded in early childhood and is a predictor of academic achievement. Students use self-regulation through several methods to monitor, manage, and assess both their behavior and academic achievement. Self-regulation is a large psychological umbrella that includes a wide range of strategies, skills, and cognitive processes appropriate for all ages and abilities. Broadly, this practice guide addresses emotional and behavioral self-regulation development in students within the context of family systems and examines the contribution of cultural influences. Additionally, evidence supports teaching these skills together rather than as independent domains.",

        "description":"In mathematics, the keyword strategy involves identifying a keyword (e.g., &quot;altogether&quot;) and using that keyword to determine the operation needed to find a word problem's solution. We analyzed 747 high-stakes released items across Grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 from the Partnership for Assessment for Readiness for College and Careers and Smarter Balanced assessments. Of these, 57 items did not involve written text. Of the 690 text-based items, we classified 69% as directive word problems and 31% as routine word problems. For all 690 items, we identified any keywords (e.g., &quot;total,&quot; &quot;each,&quot; &quot;share&quot;) appearing in the text of the word problem. We categorized the 214 routine word problems by schema: total, difference, change, equal groups, comparison, ratios or proportions, or product of measures. We identified keywords within these problems and determined whether a keyword and its implied operation matched the correct problem solution. For single-step routine word problems, we determined keywords featured within the problem led to a correct problem solution with less than a 50% match rate. For multi-step routine word problems, the match rate was less than 10%. These low match rates indicate that keywords are an ineffective word-problem strategy that educators should avoid.

We compared the word-problem performance of typically achieving (TA) students and students with mathematics difficulty (MD). First, we measured the word-problem performance of all students for schemas and position of the unknown. Then, the performance of students with MD for schemas, position of the unknown, irrelevant information, and charts or graphs. Across schemas, while TA students outperformed students with MD, all students typically scored higher on Change and Difference problems than Total problems. For position of the unknown, students often scored highest on problems with the final position unknown. Students with MD also demonstrated higher scores on problems with irrelevant information than charts and graphs. Although patterns emerged, not all problems followed the same trends, suggesting further research should investigate the impact of word problem features on word-problem accuracy.

        "description":"The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using the Teach-Model-Coach-Review approach to teach Spanish-speaking caregivers from low-income households to implement &quot;EMT en Español&quot; with their young children with language delays. A secondary purpose was to explore the effects of the caregiver-implemented intervention on children's vocabulary. A final and more exploratory goal was to gain insight into caregivers' perceptions of the intervention. 21 caregiver-child dyads participated in the intent-to-treat randomized control trial. Their children were 30-43 months old with language delays. Dyads were randomly assigned to receive 24 caregiver training sessions delivered at home in Spanish or a wait list control group. Pre, post and 3-month follow assessments included observational measures of caregiver-child interactions and child standardized vocabulary assessments. Caregivers completed surveys rating their perception of the intervention. Caregivers in the intervention group had significantly higher percentages of matched turns, expansions, and targets at post-assessment and of expansions and targets at follow-up compared to the control group. Overall, children in the intervention condition had significantly higher receptive vocabulary scores and performed better than children in the control condition on observational measure of their lexical diversity, with moderate effect sizes for most outcomes. Caregivers perceived the intervention as effective and culturally appropriate. Teach-Model-Coach-Review is effective in increasing Spanish-speaking caregivers' use of &quot;EMT en Español&quot; strategies with their young children with language delays. The intervention also appears to be effective for child vocabulary outcomes and acceptable to caregivers.",

        "description":"Aim/Purpose: This study explores how online writing groups facilitate the academic identity development of doctoral scholars. Background: Academic institutions around the world, and especially in developing societies, are demanding increasing amounts of research and publications from their doctoral scholars. The current study used an online writing group to facilitate writing skills development, which bolstered the academic identity development of participating scholars. Academic identity is defined as the becoming and being of an academic scholar, with writing skills as a means of acquiring and performing the status and skills of a scholar. It is reflected in the confidence, contribution, and relationship carried out in writing as a member of the academic community. Methodology: This study utilizes narrative inquiry as a research methodology to capture the experiences of six doctoral scholars from two universities in Nepal. We explore the academic identity of doctoral scholars from a sociocultural perspective, employing unstructured interviews, meeting notes, and entry and exit surveys of the online writing group. Contribution This article shows how online writing groups offer unique and impactful opportunities for networking, collaboration, and problem-solving, which can significantly enhance their writing abilities and prospects of publication, thereby fostering their intellectual agency and academic identity. Findings: This study reports three findings of the value of online writing groups: addressing gaps in formal education, community as a form of accountability, and virtual community as a platform for identity development. On the final finding of identity development, we identify and discuss four themes from data analysis: growth of self-image as scholars, strengthening of commitment to scholarship, identification of venues for expanding the scope of publication, and enhancement of digital skills. The informal and collaborative nature of online writing support facilitated socially constructivist learning, which was highly conducive to the development of academic identity among emerging scholars. Recommendations for Practitioners: It is recommended that institutions implement and encourage online writing support programs as an effective means of addressing gaps in doctoral education. While this program can fill gaps in the low-resource contexts of developing countries, it can bolster formal mentoring in any context. Recommendations for Researchers: Further research should use large-scale or longitudinal studies to explore how informal, especially online writing support and collaboration, accelerate research and writing skills, scholarly productivity, and overall academic identity formation of doctoral scholars. Impact on Society: As societies around the world accelerate their demand for doctoral degrees and also require research and publications for degree completion, new and creative approaches utilizing emerging technologies could help to fill gaps in curriculum and support systems for their doctoral scholars. Future Research: Future research could expand the scope and take a longitudinal approach for more fine-grained data and developing broader perspectives.",

        "description":"The Oregon Statewide Report Card is an annual publication required by law (ORS 329.115), which reports on the state of public schools. The purpose of the Statewide Report Card is to monitor trends among school districts and Oregon's progress toward achieving the goals referred to in ORS 329.015. In addition, this report provides a tool that makes education data accessible to researchers, media, students, and families and creates a clear, complete, and factual picture of the state of education in Oregon. This annual report acts as a snapshot of the state's education system that includes important statewide data about students, teachers, and schools from the 2021-22 school year. The data routinely archived in this report continues to be impacted by the statewide response to the COVID-19 pandemic. [For the 2020-2021 report, see ED619789.]",

        "author":["Al-Jarf, Reima"],
        "description":"Son and daughter metaphorical expressions are common in general as well as technical languages. This study explores the similarities and differences between English and Arabic ibn (son) and bint (daughter) expressions, and the difficulties that student-translators have with them. A corpus of English and Arabic general ibn (son) and bint (daughter) expressions (daughters of Eve, daughter of invention, son of Adam, son of a biscuit, son of a gun) and another corpus of specialized expressions (son of Minos, daughter board, daughter activity) were collected, analyzed and compared. It was found that ibn (son) and bint (daughter) expressions fall into 4 categories: (i) those that are identical in form and meaning in both languages (daughters of Eve, son of Adam); (ii) those that are similar in meaning but differ in wording (step-daughter); (iii) those that exist in English, but have no equivalents in Arabic (daughter of Sappho); and (iv) those that exist in Arabic but have no equivalents in English (daughter of Yemen, i.e., coffee). Specialized expressions used in medicine, computers, business and others are exact translations in both languages (daughter company, daughter cyst, daughter isotope). Student-translators could translate fewer than 13% of the Arabic test items and 12% of the English test items correctly and left 75% blank. Son and daughter expressions similar in both languages were easy to translate (like mother like daughter), whereas opaque ones [Arabic characters omitted], culture-specific ones [Arabic characters omitted] and those requiring a specialized background knowledge were difficult (daughter board). Extraneous translation, paraphrase, Literal translation, use of synonyms, transliteration of Arabic words, partial translation, and giving the same translation for different expressions were the most common strategies. Translation difficulties are due to semantic and syntactic problems that the students have. Results and recommendations are given in detail.",

        "description":"The purpose this review was to conduct a meta-analysis of 25 years of mathematics interventions for students with mathematics difficulty or disability in grades 4 through 12. A search of the literature yielded 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Studies were coded to extract important study information (e.g., participant information, research design, description of treatment and comparison groups) and data needed to calculate Hedge's g. We used robust variance estimation (RVE) to address dependence resulting from multiple outcomes per study. The RVE random-effects model estimated a treatment effect of 0.85. After adjusting for small study effects, the final model estimated an underlying, moderate effect of 0.49 with a large amount of unexplained heterogeneity between studies. Studies with more than 15 hours of treatment and those focused on fraction content significantly moderated mathematics outcomes. Findings are limited by extreme variability across study estimates, the lack of standardized mathematics measures, and a limited number of studies across 25 years of research.

        "description":"In this study, the scale named &quot;Survey of Online Reading Attitudes and Behaviours&quot; developed by Putman (2014) was adapted to Turkish after obtaining the necessary permissions. It was concluded that the scale could be used in Turkish education to determine the attitudes and behaviours of middle school students towards online reading activities. It was observed that the predicted five-factor structure of the scale explained 43.47% of the total variance and maintained the 53 item structure in accordance with the original scale. The internal consistency coefficient is 0.83 for the whole scale; 0.78 for the effect dimension; 0.83 for the cognition dimension; 0.92 for the value dimension; it was calculated as .81 for the self regulation dimension and .789 for the anxiety dimension. The differences between the 27% lower and upper groups were examined in order to ensure the reliability procedures. In the analysis (t([subscript 742])=24.35, p&lt;0.01), statistically significant differences were observed between the lower and upper groups. Subsequently, confirmatory factor analyzes were conducted to examine the compatibility with the original scale. As a result of the analysis, it was seen that the fit indices of the scale were in the desired range (TLI=0.90; CFI=0.87, GFI=0.89, RMSEA=0.06). As a result of all the procedures performed for the scale, it was decided that the scale is a tool that can determine the attitudes and beliefs of middle school students towards online reading.",

However, it is also critical to evaluate whether the treatment effects are heterogeneous, and whether they depend on contextual variables such as disadvantaged student status and characteristics of the school settings. The current study extends the evaluation of a novel video recommendation system by performing an exploratory search for sources of heterogeneity of treatment effects. This study's design is a multi-site randomized controlled trial with an assignment at the student level across three large and diverse school districts in the southeast United States. The study occurred in Spring 2021, when some students were in regular classrooms and others in online classrooms. The results of the current study replicate positive effects found in a previous field experiment that occurred in Spring 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, causal forests were used to investigate the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This study contributes to the literature on content sequencing systems and recommendation systems by showing how these systems can disproportionally benefit the groups of students who had higher levels of previous algebra ability, followed more recommendations, learned remotely, were Hispanic, and received free or reduced-price lunch, which has implications for the fairness of implementation of educational technology solutions.",

The key idea is to use variation across time and space (e.g., school districts) to estimate the effects of policy or programmatic changes that happen in some localities but not others. In this commentary we highlight some specific challenges for panel or longitudinal studies of K-12 education interventions during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to help researchers think through the underlying issues and assumptions, and to help consumers of those studies assess their validity.

        "description":"The synthetic control method (SCM) is a popular approach for estimating the impact of a treatment on a single unit in panel data settings. The &quot;synthetic control&quot; is a weighted average of control units that balances the treated unit's pre-treatment outcomes and other covariates as closely as possible. A critical feature of the original proposal is to use SCM only when the fit on pre-treatment outcomes is excellent. We propose Augmented SCM as an extension of SCM to settings where such pre-treatment fit is infeasible. Analogous to bias correction for inexact matching, Augmented SCM uses an outcome model to estimate the bias due to imperfect pretreatment fit and then de-biases the original SCM estimate. Our main proposal, which uses ridge regression as the outcome model, directly controls pre-treatment fit while minimizing extrapolation from the convex hull. This estimator can also be expressed as a solution to a modified synthetic controls problem that allows negative weights on some donor units. We bound the estimation error of this approach under different data generating processes, including a linear factor model, and show how regularization helps to avoid over-fitting to noise. We demonstrate gains from Augmented SCM with extensive simulation studies and apply this framework to estimate the impact of the 2012 Kansas tax cuts on economic growth. We implement the proposed method in the new augsynth R package. [This paper was published in &quot;Journal of the American Statistical Association&quot; v116 n536 2021.]",

The overarching project comprises multiple data sets, multiple scientists across (distant) institutions, and multiple teams of discourse analysts who are tasked with scoring over 20,000 verbal protocols (i.e., think aloud, self-explanation) collected in studies conducted in the last decade. Here, we describe the iterative modifications, negotiations, and realizations while coding our first subset comprising 7,559 individual verbal protocols. Drawing upon work in design research, we describe a process through which the research team has negotiated meaning around theory-driven codes and how this work has influenced our own ways of conceptualizing comprehension research, theory, and practice.

Thus, instruction needs to move from part (morphemes) to whole (polysyllabic words). This guide includes information about teaching students about morphemes for the purpose of improving students' word recognition and spelling skills. Students need to learn the meaning of parts of words and be able to read those parts to develop quality word recognition. It is intended for students with dyslexia who have a word-reading disability; therefore, instruction in morphology is beneficial (Austin et al., 2022). Further, research on children with dyslexia suggests older children exhibit problems based more in morphology than in phonology (Champion, 1997); thus, explicit instruction in morphology is recommended (Casalis et al., 2004). In addition, students with speech and language impairment are at-risk for literacy difficulties; thus, morphological instruction is advantageous (McLeod &amp; Apel, 2015; Wolter &amp; Green, 2013). Morphology instruction also supports bilingual learners to see similar word parts across different words (Crosson et al., 2018; Keiffer &amp; DiFelice, 2013).",

        "description":"The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and as many as a third of Americans have some type of criminal record. Upon reentry, individuals with a justice history, whom referred as returning citizens, face significant barriers to economic security and reintegration into their communities. Among the most formidable barriers to reentry are a disadvantaged living environment, low levels of education, mental health challenges, and stigma that excludes them from job opportunities and other resources. All of these factors contribute to a high recidivism rate among returning citizens and make it harder for them to secure employment. Entrepreneurship presents a promising pathway to economic security and reintegration into communities as it requires minimal formal schooling, provides additional income and control over their livelihoods, and has the potential to uplift the often-low-income communities to which these individuals return. While entrepreneurship has great potential to reduce recidivism and promote economic stability, returning citizens have to overcome several hurdles in their entrepreneurship endeavors, ranging from a lack of access to capital, collateral consequences of having a criminal record, a digital skills gap, and limited access to wraparound support services. The paper will highlight two entrepreneurship training initiatives in Missouri and Washington, D.C. [This paper is a collaboration with the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO).]",

By the end of the first year of their program, scholars in each cohort work in cross-institutional collaborative groups to create an Intensive Intervention Practice Guide. In each guide, scholars identify an approach to intensive intervention for a select population of students with disabilities, describe the existing evidence base behind it, and discuss the next steps in research needed to improve the understanding of designing and delivering the intervention. The &quot;Intensive Intervention Practice Guides&quot; are created for practitioners as well as faculty engaged in instructing pre- and in-service teachers. This practice guide discusses the purpose of self-monitoring systems, which is to develop students' self-determination skills by improving the awareness of their own behavior. Crucial components of a self-monitoring system include students observing, evaluating, and recording their own behavior that is explicitly defined; students striving for independence and maintaining positive outcomes; and generalization of these skills beyond the initial training setting. Among the two most common self-monitoring approaches include: (1) a student monitors and records the presence of a behavior; and (2) a student rates their own behavior according to a set of pre-specified criteria. This practice guide provides the benefits of self-monitoring and these two common approaches.",

        "description":"This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at supporting non-education faculty and facilitators in creating inclusive educational programs and learning opportunities that address the needs, interests, and priorities of underrepresented individuals and communities in the field of STEM. The framework centers on the fundamental concept of understanding the learner's &quot;why&quot; to assist faculty in developing effective teaching strategies. The article outlines how this framework can be applied in various academic settings and contexts and provides educators and program facilitators with guidance to foster meaningful student connections. Each element of the framework is discussed, accompanied by a set of reflective questions that encourage educators to rethink and redesign their educational experiences. Furthermore, the paper illustrates the practical application of the framework through three distinct case studies that include a project-based learning program for high school students, a college undergraduate STEM course, and a summer research experience for undergraduates. By employing this framework, educators and facilitators can enhance their pedagogical practices, ensuring that traditionally marginalized voices and perspectives are elevated, acknowledged, and valued within STEM education. Ultimately, this work can contribute to a more equitable and inclusive educational landscape, fostering increased engagement and success among underrepresented learners in STEM fields.",

        "description":"To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home orders, and numerous studies aim to estimate their effects. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. While these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. &quot;Target trial emulation&quot; emphasizes the need to carefully design a non-experimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement -- and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (&quot;panel&quot;) data need to take a similar careful approach to study design, which we refer to as &quot;policy trial emulation.&quot; This is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each &quot;treatment cohort&quot; (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods -- with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics -- can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.

        "description":"School leaders across the state of California seek tools to reduce the use of exclusionary discipline and improve school climates. Research suggests that restorative practices (RPs) have the potential to achieve these ends, particularly when staff throughout the school implement, and students throughout the school experience, these practices. Research also indicates that schools often struggle to achieve widespread adoption of RPs. In many cases, schools will see selective adoption of RPs--some teachers use these practices while others do not (resulting in only some students experiencing these practices). And districts will see some schools implementing these practices while others struggle to do so. How can schools overcome these implementation challenges? The first step is to identify sticking points in implementation. To do this, school and district leaders need simple, reliable means of measuring the extent to which teachers are using and students are experiencing RPs. At present, though, many leaders lack measures of RP utilization and exposure. This report provides detailed guidance regarding why, when, and how to measure the use of RPs in schools. In the first section, the authors briefly describe what RPs are and summarize research regarding the potential of these practices to decrease the use of discipline, reduce racial disparities in discipline and academic achievement, and improve school climates. In the second section, they discuss why measuring RP implementation is essential to employing RPs in a manner that is likely to achieve the intended impacts. In the third section, the authors provide detailed guidance on how to measure the extent to which teachers are using and students are being exposed to these potent practices.",

        "description":"Finding effective ways to improve school attendance is more important than ever given the dramatic increases in chronic absence nationwide and in California. This report presents a compelling case for using data about unexcused absences to advance a more preventive, problem-solving, and equitable response to poor attendance. When an absence is labeled unexcused, it affects how a student and their family are treated. Although students face no negative consequences for excused absences, they can be denied credit for missed work, excluded from extracurricular activities, and eventually taken to court and fined for unexcused absences. As absences accumulate, responses generally become more punitive. Yet punitive responses are unlikely to improve attendance when absences occur for reasons beyond the control of the student and their family. Rather, overuse of the unexcused-absence label could undermine efforts to partner with students and families to improve attendance. This report concludes with recommendations for how stakeholders can use data to detect and address disparities in the labeling of unexcused absences and advance more equitable opportunities to learn.

A survey research design with both qualitative and quantitative approaches involving concurrent triangulation strategy was employed. The study period was from February 2020 and November 2020. A total of 354 respondents (219 students, 125 instructors, 3 college deans, 4 department heads, 3 Quality Assurance and Cooperative Learning Coordinators (QACLCs)) were the participants of the study. Except for deans, heads, and QACLCs, who were selected by purposive sampling, all the rest were selected randomly. Questionnaires, and interviews, were tools/sources of data. The data gathered through questionnaires were analyzed using percentage, frequency, mean, combined mean, standard deviation, and combined standard deviation, one-way ANOVAs, and interview data were analyzed by narration and direct quotation of the respondent idea. The result of the study showed that the perception of both teachers and students towards the CA was positive. Regarding the practice of CA, there was low extent of CA practices. The implication is that CA as a means to improve students learning and academic achievement is not practiced in line with student assessment guidelines (such as MoE students assessment guidelines). Thus, to make the maximum academic benefits out of the practice of CA, all concerned bodies/actors (at all levels (higher level - Ministry of education/Ministry of science and higher education) to the lower level (department/staff level) should give special attention to the CA implementation policy. Appropriate training (particularly related to conceptualization, methods, techniques of CA including its practice, and academic integrity) should also be delivered to instructors and students. Finally, to properly implement CA, it is recommended that countrywide research, involving all other variables and higher learning institutions not considered in this study, should be conducted in the future.",

        "description":"This study investigates the effect of phonological awareness instruction on the development of word-reading ability for EFL first-graders in a Jordanian state school. Based on Chard and Dickson's (1999) phonological awareness hierarchy, a phonological awareness training program was developed by the researchers, and used in training the experimental group whose children after 10 training sessions significantly outperformed their peers in the control group on TampaReads' (2003) word-reading measures. The study concludes that phonological awareness is relevant to the development of first-graders' word-reading ability, and that explicit phonological awareness instruction is essential for this development. The study thus provides support to previous research, and implies that phonological awareness can be taught contrary to the notion of the pure whole language approach, and that explicit phonological awareness intervention can help overcome the Jordanian EFL children's reading problems once it is systematically integrated into their school curricula.",

This clenches the amplified direction of the current study, where its primary objective is to assess the speaking skills of the SHS-HUMMS students of the DNHS. This study envisioned identifying the speaking factors in terms of grammar, vocabulary, aspects of discourse, pronunciation, and interaction. It utilizes the quanti correlational descriptive method, which uses the purposive sampling procedure. Standardized rubrics for speaking skills were utilized, tabulated, and interpreted using the appropriate tools. This was further validated by the concurrent opinions of two language experts in the area of linguistics. Overall, the findings revealed a speaking peculiarity in proficiency. This surfaced after the data were treated with statistical measures using frequency and percentage, Kruskal-Wallis H-value for pairwise comparison, ANOVA, and Shapiro-Wilk for multi-variant normality. This was explained using a contingency table. Furthermore, the results showed no significant difference between the levels of indicators affecting speaking skills. Two factors that affected the respondents' speaking skills, however, were pronunciation and interaction. Overall, an intervention program was put in place in order to address the speaking problem of the respondents.",

        "description":"This updated 2022 annotated bibliography reviews nine postsecondary peer cooperative learning programs that have been implemented nationally and internationally to increase student achievement. A number of the publications report how they adapted their programs due to COVID-19 restrictions and online delivery platforms. They have been so satisfied with that move, they are now providing their services both face-to-face and online. Technology use was more often reported in these publications. URLs are provided for approximately half of the publications so that they can be downloaded. Nearly twenty-five percent of the entries in this bibliography are from authors and researchers outside of the United States. An extensive literature search was conducted of published journal articles, newspaper accounts, book chapters, books, ERIC documents, thesis and dissertations, online documents, and unpublished reports. Peer learning programs in this bibliography meet the following characteristics: (a) program must have been implemented at the postsecondary or tertiary level, (b) program has a clear set of systematic procedures for its implementation at an institution, (c) program evaluation studies have been conducted and are available for review, (d) program intentionally embeds learning strategy practice along with review of the academic content material, (e) program outcomes include both increased content knowledge with higher persistence rates, and (f) program has been replicated at another institution with similar positive student outcomes. From a review of the professional literature, 1,987 citations (a growth of 347 over the last edition) emerged concerning nine programs that met the previously mentioned selection criteria: &quot;Accelerated Learning Groups&quot; (ALGs, USC model), &quot;Emerging Peer Educator&quot;, &quot;Emerging Scholars Program&quot; (ESP, UC Berkeley; Treisman model), Learning Assistant&quot; (CU Boulder model), &quot;Peer Assisted Learning&quot; (PAL, UMN model), &quot;Peer-Led Team Learning&quot; (PLTL, CUNY model), &quot;Structured Learning Assistance&quot; (SLA, FSU model), &quot;Supplemental Instruction-PASS&quot; (SI, UMKC model), and &quot;Video-based Supplemental Instruction&quot; (VSI, UMKC model). This is the first year for the inclusion of the Emerging Peer Educator and Learning Assistant models in this bibliography. Guidance is provided to implement best practices of peer learning programs that improve academic achievement, persistence to graduation, and professional growth of participants and facilitators of these student-led groups. The literature reports not only positive outcomes for the student participants of such programs, but includes outcomes for the student peer leaders of these academic support programs such as skill improvement with leader identity emergence, leadership, public speaking, interpersonal communication, and other employment skills along with an impact of their future vocational choices including a career in teaching at the secondary or postsecondary level. Educators need to investigate these peer learning programs to discover effective learning practices that can be adapted and adopted for use in supporting higher student achievement for students of diverse backgrounds.

        "description":"In the formal education system, teaching-learning is a process where teacher is actively engaged in providing quality education to the learners. Teacher is the only one who can recognize and identify the unique capabilities of the students. In a diverse classroom, every student is different from others, keeping this in mind, a teacher has to design teaching-learning process as per the learning needs of the learners. One way of knowing and addressing the individual needs of students is by identifying and implementing theory of multiple intelligences in classroom. Research studies have shown that profile of multiple intelligences of a teacher has a direct impact on teacher effectiveness and teaching learning practices. Studies also claim that majority of the schools tend to focus mainly on two intelligences, those associated with academic intelligence, i.e., linguistic and logical/mathematical and teachers are low when it comes to intelligences like interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic and existential. Hence, the primary research question of this study is to explore about this less explored intelligences of the teachers. The present study is a cross-sectional survey study when the data about the multiple intelligences of 96 randomly selected teachers working in various schools of Delhi was collected using a pre-developed tool of multiple intelligences. The results of the study reveal that there is strong need to organize training programme to improve the multiple intelligences of the teachers. The findings also reveal that gender of the teacher has an influence on their multiple intelligences and female teachers scored better than male teachers in this regard. Also teachers from schools located in urban area were better in multiple intelligences than the teachers from schools located in rural areas. It was however observed that both government and private school teachers performed almost same and educational qualification of the teachers and their teaching experience did not have any influence on their multiple intelligences. The study also recommended about the scope of further research in this area of multiple intelligences.",

Because children spend much time in same-gender relationships, promoting other-gender prosociality could help them develop more inclusive relationships. Our goal in the present research was to better understand the extent to which elementary-school age children consider their own and the recipient's gender in prosocial behavior. Participants included 515 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders (263, 51.1% boys, M[subscript ageinyears] = 9.08, SD = 1.00) surveyed in the fall (T1) and spring (T2). We assessed children's prosociality using peer nominations. We found that gender mattered: children showed an ingroup bias in prosociality favoring members of their own gender group. Having other-gender friendships positively predicted children's prosocial behavior toward other-gender peers. Children's felt similarity to other-gender peers was not directly, but indirectly, related to their prosocial behavior toward other-gender peers. Findings shed light on potential pathways to fostering school-age children's gender-based prosociality. [This paper was published in &quot;British Journal of Developmental Psychology.&quot;]",

        "description":"Negative yes-no (polar) questions in Colloquial Arabic (CA) are formed by intonation without adding yes-no question particles, in which case, a statement is uttered with a rising intonation, whether this polar question is negative or affirmative. This case is more common in CA than written MSA. Sometimes, the same negative polar question is uttered with different intonations, giving different meanings. This article investigates the multiple meanings of negative polar questions in Hijazi Arabic (HA), the kinds of ambiguities resulting from using different rising intonations, and how negative polar questions are answered. A sample of negative polar questions in HA was collected. Each was uttered with different rising intonations by a sample of students enrolled in a Semantics and Pragmatics course at the College of Languages and Translation and recordings of those were made. The student informants were asked about the meaning conveyed by each intonation of the same negative polar question. Results showed that [Arabic characters omitted] Didn't you buy a dress last week?&quot; is a negative polar question formed with a change in intonations.

The answer would be either &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, or an echo answer: &quot;Yes I bought it&quot; or &quot;No I didn't buy it&quot;; (ii) a confirmation question to which the reply is &quot;yes&quot; only; (iii) a confirmation question to which the reply is &quot;no&quot; only; (iv) disapproval: &quot;Didn't you buy a dress last week? Why do you want to by another dress? (v) an exclamation: Wow! You have bought a new dress, although you bought one last week! What a surprise! The context makes it clear which meaning each intonation implies. Detailed results of the interpretation of a sample of ambiguous spoken negative polar questions are reported.",

        "description":"This study investigated the connection between translanguaging and reading comprehension of Filipino ESL intermediate learners. The respondents were intermediate pupils enrolled in the selected central schools in Bicol, Philippines. The respondents' ages range from 8 to 12 years old, and 124 students (27.55%) were males while 326 students (72.44%) were females. The descriptive-correlational method was used in the study. The descriptive method was used to describe the reading performance of the ESL intermediate learners and their translanguaging factors, while Pearson Product Moment Correlation was used to determine the relationship between the two variables. The primary instruments used were validated teacher-made reading comprehension test and translanguage factors survey questionnaire. Data disclosed that the general reading comprehension of the ESL intermediate learners along with vocabulary, drawing inferences, and getting the main idea, are very satisfactory. Meanwhile, the different translanguaging factors, along with personal, teacher, and social, were surveyed and identified in the study. The statistical test revealed that the reading comprehension of the respondents was significantly correlated with the identified translanguaging factors. Thus, it is recommended that teachers should promote group discussions and allow open interactions in the classroom. Teachers should allow the use of both the home language and English; employ translanguaging pedagogy in teaching reading; foster an understanding and acceptance of linguistic differences; promote multilingualism, and allow indigenous languages to be used in education to facilitate meaningful learning.",

        "description":"Stance is a feature of academic writing that refers to how writers interact and engage with their readers by means of linguistic devices. This study focuses on the grammatical devices--and semantic distinctions thereof--that are employed by academic writers of English to express stance in research article abstracts in the areas of applied linguistics (AL) and literature (L). To this end, a corpus of 120 research article abstracts (60 in the area of AL and another 60 in that of L) was built and analysed using SPSS and following Biber et al.'s (1999) framework of grammatical devices of stance. The abstracts were extracted from high-quality journals in the respective areas: &quot;Applied Linguistics&quot; and &quot;English: Journal of the English Association.&quot; Both are ISI journals and published by Oxford Academic Publishing. A mixed-method approach, applying quantitative and qualitative measures, was adopted to answer the two questions: How is stance grammatically expressed in AL research article abstracts and L research article abstracts, and How is the expression of stance in AL research article abstracts similar to/different from that in L ones? The findings are construed in light of theories of academic discourse and English for Academic Purposes (EAP). The results reveal that there are important similarities and differences in the extent to which and the means through which stance is expressed in AL research article abstracts and L research article abstracts. In particular, the findings show that both AL and L abstracts were similar in the most frequently used stance marker which is the stance complement clause. However, they were different in the frequency of use of other devices. The study provides insights into the ways academic writers express stance in various fields which better our ability to write research article abstracts.",

        "description":"Enderun School was a palace educational institution designed for the training of administrative and military staff in the Ottomans. The Enderun School had an important role in the success of the Ottoman Empire. Enderun, a school where especially civil and military administrators were trained, was established to create the necessary manpower resource for the Ottoman central and provincial bureaucracy. Enderun formed the basic education unit where students were taught and raised through the official Ottoman ideology or mentality. In addition, it had an important role in the determination of administrative and political goals and the functioning of the main institutions of the state. Enderun School was an educational institution that served the Ottoman Empire for centuries. The basis of Enderun's success was the process and quality of the education given to the students admitted here, as well as selecting the talents that were needed and with the necessary virtues from a wide candidate base at various levels and stages. When Ottoman educational institutions are examined in terms of educational function, Enderun School is seen as the most critical educational institution for the state tradition as Enderun Schools was mainly constructed for the training of Ottoman senior managers. Enderun School was the most organized and the most developed among the palace schools of the Ottoman period. It had many organizations and regulations of its own. The administrators of this school were people who were directly related to the Sultan. Enderun School had an important role in the history of the education of gifted children, as it selected and educated children with gifted intelligence and qualifications. It is believed that understanding and familiarizing oneself with the educational practices applied in the past can have a positive impact on the education of gifted children today. With this study, the Enderun School will be examined in detail, based on the work -&quot;Târih-i Atâ&quot;- of Tayyarzade Ata, who was one of the most important sources of the Ottoman period and was also a student of the Enderun School.",

        "description":"In the contemporary milieu of academia and quotidian endeavors, the faculty of critical thinking is recognized as an essential and irreplaceable aptitude for each individual. Over the course of recent decades, the subject of critical thinking has garnered substantial attention across the sphere of higher education, with Chinese students being no exception. The present investigation seeks to elucidate the exigencies evaluation of international Chinese postgraduate students' perceptions pertaining to the incorporation of critical thinking methodologies within research methods coursework, in conjunction with their requisites and expectations for the inculcation of critical thinking proficiencies as an integral constituent of the academic writing curriculum. This empirical inquiry, employing a mixed-methods approach, drew upon the Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CTDI) as its primary instrument. A total of 147 Chinese international college master's students voluntarily partook in the study. The resultant data revealed that the understanding of critical thinking abilities among the overseas Chinese postgraduate population was marked by ambiguity and perplexity. Such a phenomenon can be attributed to the influence of the traditional Chinese educational system, which engenders a prevalent indifference towards critical thinking competencies among the majority of the international Chinese postgraduate demographic. To address the exigency of bolstering their scholastic achievements and enhancing their thesis-writing efficacy through more analytical and critical means, the Chinese postgraduate respondents underscored the imperative to amalgamate critical thinking skills into their research methods coursework.",

        "description":"Children with hearing loss show a similar development to their hearing peers in terms of the development of oral and written language. They may experience some delays in oral language skills, which is one of the sub-fields of literacy. Children with hearing loss in the preschool period in Turkey receive support education services from preschool inclusive environments and special education and rehabilitation center (SERC). Research indicates that education programs related to early literacy positively affect teachers' professional development, the characteristics, and practices of literacy environments. In addition, supporting the professional development of teachers with roles such as guidance/mentoring/coaching indirectly affects the literacy development of children indirectly. Research with teachers on early literacy development in children with hearing loss in Turkey are about teachers' reflections on their own learning-teaching processes. It is stated that teachers working with preschool children do not have sufficient knowledge about early literacy in Turkey. Research in SERCs also emphasize the importance of supporting the education of children with hearing loss through the participation of teachers in SERCs with in-service training. The study aims to examine the process with one hearing-impaired children teacher in the context of the early literacy development in-service training program. It was designed as participatory action research because it overlaps with an in-service training process that can meet the information needs of one teacher in SERC about early literacy development. The data were collected through field notes and video recording observations, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, documents, products, and a research diary. All data were analyzed inductively during the research process and at the end of the research. It is seen that the knowledge of teachers in the SERC, where support education services in Turkey, is limited on early literacy development. Teacher's needs can be listed as relating the goals with early literacy experiences, planning the lesson in accordance with the level of the child and supporting early literacy, determining the appropriate material, implementation and evaluation. A program to be developed to support teachers regarding early literacy; in addition to informing, it can be stated that the implementation and evaluation processes are supportive of the development. In the implementation of such programs, it can be emphasized that it is important to consider adult learning, to give positive and immediate feedback, and to use internal and external motivational resources.",

        "title":"Different Pathways, Different Impacts: Examining How Alternative Certification Pathways Influence Student Achievement in Kentucky",
        "author":["Butler, Aaron James"],
        "description":"Alternative teacher certification has emerged in the past two decades as one policy state leaders can leverage to recruit and prepare high-quality teachers to meet demands that are unique to their student populations. Indeed, in specific circumstances such as addressing teacher shortages, alternative teacher certification can be viewed as an important aspect of a state's overall human capital management strategy. While a growing body of research has emerged examining the impact of alternatively certified teachers on student achievement, few economists and policy scholars have substantially investigated the relative effectiveness of alternative certification pathways within a state licensure framework. This quantitative research study broadens the field's understanding of alternative certification by examining the impact of classroom teachers who received their certification from one of eight different alternative certification pathways available in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Specifically, the study considers the impact these teachers have on high school student achievement in mathematics and reading as measured by the ACT. Using administrative data from the Kentucky Center for Education and Workforce Statistics (KCEWS) for academic year 2013-2014 and a propensity score matching method to estimate teacher effects, this study found both positive and negative effects of classroom teachers on student achievement in mathematics and reading. More importantly, the study discovered that these effects differed by the teachers' alternative certification pathway. Teachers who received their certification from an accredited university-based alternative teacher certification program generally outperformed other alternatively certified teachers in the Commonwealth. In fact, alternatively certified teachers trained through a university-based program were the only alternatively certified teachers to positively impact student achievement in both mathematics and reading when controlling for teacher experience. Taken together, findings from this study offer important implications for the ways in which the Commonwealth certifies alternative certification program providers, establishes expectations for program delivery, and evaluates programs during regular program accreditation cycles.",

A school's goals express the collective desires for each of its students, what the students know, what they are able to do, how they behave, and how they manage their own learning. The ultimate goal in school improvement is for the people associated with the school to drive its continuous improvement for the sake of their children and students. They do this by sharpening their practice and honing each specific practice every day. While some need to solve their problems alone, a school is surrounded by other people which is an advantage, and theirs, if they adopt an effective process to assist each other in sharpening their practices.

        "description":"Computers are problem-solving tools at heart. Without an operating system though, they would be rendered useless. Most computer users are unaware of the inherent capabilities of the bare OS and the problems it can solve for them. This comes naturally in an era of commercialized solutions in the form of apps and software packages. However, gaining understanding of the built-in functions of an OS hidden behind the graphical user interface may let students discover new, personally relevant problems. In turn, attempts at formulating and solving these could help students gain complex cognitive skills in IT. This study explores the notion of problem-posing and proposes a Web-based learning environment; where users may create guides and tutorials in addition to posing their own educational problems pertaining to GNU/Linux Command Line use. Problems are stored in a repository and may be rated, reviewed, discussed or solved by peers. A virtual environment running a Linux distribution may be configured by users to accompany a posed problem and help create a complete sandbox reflecting the problem's story and structural elements.",

        "description":"Geometry is one of the most important branches of mathematics education, because the aim of the geometry teaching is to provide students with the ability of critical thinking, problem solving and a better understanding of the other subjects in mathematics by making the students have a high level of geometric thinking skills (Sahin, O., 2008). Research of problem solving, which is located in the centre of education, in this extremely important branch of mathematics education is quite important for mathematics education in our country as in many countries. There is a lot of research on this issue in the literature. Elçin Emre (2008), has searched secondary school students' abilities of using problem solving strategies in her master's thesis and reached the conclusion that students are quite willing to use a strategy they have learned. Elçin Emre has also observed that students can use the strategies they have learned appropriately in their homework after the strategy teaching. On another research, Israel (2003) has examined problem solving strategies used by 8th grade students in terms of level of success, gender, and socio-economic level variables and reached the conclusion that there is a significant relation between problem solving strategies and the level of success, socio-economic level and gender. This study investigated elementary mathematics teacher candidates' problem solving strategies in geometry classes. The study was carried out with the participation of 20 students attending Buca Faculty of Education Elementary Mathematics Education program in 2012-2013 spring semester. In this study, semi-structured interview was used among qualitative research methods. In order to determine teacher candidates' problem solving strategies, semi-structured interview form and &quot;the form of determining geometry problem solving strategies&quot; consisting of open-ended questions were developed as a means of data collection. In the part of the research findings, there is data including problem solving strategies used by mathematics teacher candidates and the analysis of these strategies according to gender difference. According to the findings, it is determined that teacher candidates benefit from different problem solving strategies existing in the literature. It is thought that investigation of problem solving, which has great importance in the field of mathematics as in many other areas, in geometry classes provides an important contribution to mathematics education by helping students develop their reasoning and problem solving skills, which is one of the aims of mathematics teaching, and providing these skills to be used later in life (Yilmaz, 2007).",

Included studies (n = 28) meet the What Works Clearinghouse Group Design standards (Version 4.0) for study quality. Across all studies, we found significant mean effects (g = 0.68) favoring intervention. Understanding which instructional components within interventions are associated with effects was a fundamental purpose of the study. Random-effects meta-regression models with robust variance estimation (RVE) were used to examine which instructional components moderated effects. The teaching and use of accurate mathematical language emerged as significant (b = 0.50, p = 0.042) when controlling for other instructional components (visual representations, review, student explanations, and fluency building activities) and three control variables (group size, duration, nature of the control). Intervention characteristics and study design features were also explored through moderator analysis. Group size, duration, nature of the control, type of measure, interventionist, provision of ongoing training, and grade level emerged as significant moderators (p &lt; 0.05).

Capacity-building efforts help leaders develop a repertoire of knowledge, skills, and dispositions to collectively lead equity-minded change efforts on campus. To create environments where SEL can thrive, campuses need to build capacity for both shared leadership and DEI. This distinction is important because shared leadership capacity building involves working and leading collaboratively, whereas capacity building for DEI is more focused on the knowledge, skills, and critical consciousness necessary to make progress toward DEI-related goals. Additionally, capacity for SEL must be built at multiple levels--the personal or individual level, the collective or team level, and the organizational level.

        "description":"Staggered adoption of policies by different units at different times creates promising opportunities for observational causal inference. Estimation remains challenging, however, and common regression methods can give misleading results. A promising alternative is the synthetic control method (SCM), which finds a weighted average of control units that closely balances the treated unit's pre-treatment outcomes. In this paper, we generalize SCM, originally designed to study a single treated unit, to the staggered adoption setting. We first bound the error for the average effect and show that it depends on both the imbalance for each treated unit separately and the imbalance for the average of the treated units. We then propose 'partially pooled' SCM weights to minimize a weighted combination of these measures; approaches that focus only on balancing one of the two components can lead to bias. We extend this approach to incorporate unit-level intercept shifts and auxiliary covariates. We assess the performance of the proposed method via extensive simulations and apply our results to the question of whether teacher collective bargaining leads to higher school spending, finding minimal impacts. We implement the proposed method in the augsynth R package. [This paper was published in &quot;Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology&quot; v84 n2 Apr 2022.]",

However, few frameworks exist to help leadership ascertain how to select an MBC approach for a clinical setting. This paper seeks to define how an MBC approach can display clinical utility to provide such a framework. Broadly, we define clinical utility as evidence that an MBC approach assists stakeholders in fulfilling clinical goals related to care quality (i.e., improve client clinician alliance and clinical outcomes) at the client (i.e., youth and caregiver), clinician, supervisor, and administrator levels. More specifically, our definition of clinical utility is divided into two categories relevant to the usability and usefulness of an MBC approach for a specific setting: (a) implementability (i.e., evidence indicating ease of use in a clinical setting) and (b) usefulness in aiding clinical activities (i.e., evidence indicating the potential to improve communication and make clinical activities related to care quality easier or more effective). These categories provide valuable information about how easy an MBC approach is to use and the potential benefits that the MBC data will confer. To detail how we arrived at this definition, we review prior definitions of clinical utility, discuss how previous definitions inform our definition of clinical utility for MBC, and provide examples of how the concept of clinical utility can be applied to MBC. We finish with a discussion of future research directions.",

        "description":"The &quot;statewide system of support,&quot; a feature of Congress's 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, provided an organizational framework for a &quot;managerial&quot; approach to school improvement that was accelerated in No Child Left Behind (2001). When Congress temporarily flooded states with economic recovery money in 2010, the surge of resources fed a reform zeal and &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; attitude that systems of support helped contain. When the flow of money subsided, patience with federal imposition withered, and frustration with languid academic outcomes mounted, ESEA was reauthorized. This time it was called the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015, and the system of support was no longer named. The structure of a system of support, however, proved useful for states that were now more independently &quot;strategic&quot; in how they guided and assisted their districts and schools. As programs, projects, and initiatives within state departments of education rise and fall with shifts in legislative emphasis and educator favor, a systems approach to school improvement provides coherence, economy, and strategic discipline. This report traces the history of systems of support and looks for overarching themes in how states addressed the improvement of their schools.

The research team worked with three schools, over three years. Instructional delivery differed across schools, primarily in setting and amount of time students received mathematics instruction. Given these various contexts, the project provided job-embedded professional development to support each school's implementation of the three key features of the project: using evidence-based curricula, using evidence-based practices, and responsive coaching. By focusing middle school intervention on algebraic reasoning--which requires a strong understanding of rational numbers, variables, and equivalence--students with MLD and MD made gains across the school year that were comparable to their peers. However, the gains were not enough to close the achievement gap between students with MLD and MD and students who are on grade-level. Given the three-year implementation of this project included two years of altered instruction due to COVID-19 restrictions, it is encouraging that students with MLD and MD made gains that were comparable to their peers. The project worked with eight teachers across the three schools and found variability among their implementation and how they preferred to work with the research team. From an implementation science perspective, one year of implementing a new innovation is likely insufficient to fully build capacity in teachers to sustain the practices learned from the JEPD. However, teachers indicated that they learned many new things related to teaching students with MLD and MD through the JEPD, which is encouraging.",

        "description":"Education has gone through rapid changes during the emergency remote teaching period resulting by the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes, in part, have been associated with educational institutions attempting to implement a viable solution to the problem of distance education. Although organizational management theory literature suggests that great change in very little time results in a detrimental psychological phenomenon called change fatigue in employees and that this phenomenon has even been investigated in the context of teaching staff in the past; there have been no attempt at understanding change fatigue from a student perspective. This quantitative study attempts at proposing a structural equation model towards the understanding of how to change fatigue and other variables, namely, digital literacy, online learning attitude and school alienation that might have been influenced by it have affected teacher candidates after resuming face-to-face education followed by a 1.5 year of emergency remote teaching period. Results indicated that change fatigue predicts school alienation and yet; does not predict online learning attitude; hinting that there might be another category of alienating organizational change that universities have gone through that does not solely involve online education. Nevertheless, digital literacy is a beneficial skill for all students that helps bolster online learning attitudes and reduce overall school alienation.",

        "description":"This report provides a snapshot of the status of formative assessment implementation practiced in Sunnyside Unified School District (SUSD) in Tucson, Arizona in spring 2021. Since 2015, SUSD has engaged in a multi-year effort to support the development of teachers' formative assessment practices. The 2020-2021 school year represents an exceptional time in this learning journey as educators, leaders, and families responded to the global pandemic. During the 2020-2021 school year, a technical assistance team from the Region 15 Comprehensive Center (R15CC) supported SUSD's ongoing effort to enhance formative assessment practices (including how to translate them to online contexts) by working with 28 teachers (referred to as lab classroom teachers in this report) and 61 site leaders to support their formative assessment knowledge and practices. For this study, trained site leaders observed lab classroom teachers in their classrooms at the end of the 2020-2021 school year to assess the extent to which they implemented the FARROP formative assessment dimensions. This report summarizes findings from the observations, which focused on the extent to which all observed teachers (lab classroom teachers and nonlab classroom teachers) implemented different dimensions of formative assessment and their related indicators, with the goal of highlighting areas where teachers demonstrated proficient formative assessment practice and where there are opportunities to further support teachers' formative assessment implementation. Additionally, this report compares the formative assessment practices of lab classroom teachers who participated in the fall 2020 trainings to the nonlab classroom teachers. This report introduces the research questions, describes the data collected, and presents key findings. It ends with a summary, reflection questions, and a discussion to guide reflection on the results and the overall project.

Ever since the first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1992, the battle for fair funding has raged across the land. On the one hand, advocates of charters -- independently run, nonprofit public schools -- use research and other evidence to show how charters significantly boost the achievement of students. On the other, they have pressed hard to eliminate the massive disparities in the funding that charter students receive when compared with their district-operated peers serving similar children. As a literature review, this report aims to present facts and research from multiple sources about the impact of charter schools on student achievement, school funding, and issues related to the de facto segregation after &quot;Brown v.

District teams composed of principals, superintendents, business managers, and other district leaders participated in four 90-minute virtual sessions. The purpose of these sessions was to help leaders: (1) Collaborate with other districts to increase their knowledge and understanding of how to braid and blend federal funds; (2) Identify strategic considerations for mitigating common challenges that may arise when braiding and blending funds; and (3) Identify tools and resources that can support the successful implementation of braiding and blending funds. This guide was developed based on the community of practice work to inform other district and school leaders across Illinois about braiding and blending resource allocation strategies. The guide has four parts. It begins with an overview of the community of practice that the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) and the Region 9 Comprehensive Center conducted to support Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in braiding and blending federal funding. Following some background information, the next section provides users with the steps for braiding and blending funds by using a specific tool, including a table of priority areas and federal funding categories and programs. The third section addresses reporting. The final section is a series of appendices, including Illinois guidelines, scenarios, examples from ISBE and several Illinois districts for braiding and blending, and resources to inform those efforts.",

The U.S. Department of Education uses the term &quot;public charter school.&quot; A public charter school is a publicly funded school that is typically governed by a group or organization under a legislative contract--a charter-- with the state, district, or other entity. In general, states fund charter schools through the following channels: (1) same state formula as funding traditional public schools; (2) eligibility for federal/state grants and/or categorical programs; (3) different funding sources based on authorizers or types of charter schools; and (4) calculation methods that differ from distributing funds for traditional public schools. No uniform funding system for charter schools exists across the country. In some states, charter schools are funded just like traditional public schools, but in other states, how to fund charters is determined by the entity that authorizes charter schools. The current trend is that states and local school boards are considering their own situation in terms of students' needs and creating more diverse funding programs for public schools.",

Personal competencies--cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, social/emotional--help students coordinate and manage new learning. These competencies are enhanced by the teacher. However, the ability of a teacher to enhance these competencies cannot be assumed. The enhancement of student competencies depends on how well a teacher understands and uses his or her own competencies. These competencies are first developed through a teacher's personal learning of topics of interest to him or her. Curiosity drives a teacher to seek new knowledge (cognitive competency), and a growth mindset sustains the teacher through the process of learning with resilience and persistence (motivational competency). The teacher's high expectations for success (social/emotional competency) improve the teacher's self-appraisal of what he or she knows and his or her self-management of selecting the most appropriate strategies to ensure students' academic success (metacognitive competency). The interplay of competencies that improves personal learning also augments professional learning, increasing the teacher's ability to enhance the same competencies in students.",

        "description":"Hold-harmless provisions in state aid formulas are meant to restrict declines in revenues for school districts. They may take several forms, including limits on the changes in state aid from year to year, supplemental funding for districts with declining enrollment, alternatives for calculating the state aid amount, or use of past enrollments in grant calculations (Toutkoushian &amp; Michael, 2008). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, school districts across the country are experiencing a decrease in student enrollments, while states face reduced revenues and budget deficits in education. Therefore, hold-harmless provisions become an option for policymakers to meet the financial challenges created by the pandemic. This research brief analyzes multiple online sources (e.g., state governments, state departments of education, state school boards associations, local news). It found that nearly three in five states have implemented hold-harmless provisions or are likely to implement hold-harmless provisions in the 2020-2021 school year. In 11 states, there are some types of hold-harmless provisions embedded in basic grants for schools. In 10 states, it is unclear whether hold-harmless provisions will be implemented",

In this study, we explored the behavioral patterns of 441 3rd-grade students with and without mathematics difficulty (MD). Compared to students without MD, students with MD demonstrated higher rates of externalizing and internalizing behaviors. We then randomly assigned 162 3rd-grade students with MD to receive a 10-week word-problem intervention or to be in a business-as-usual comparison group. Within the word-problem intervention, students with MD who exhibited higher occurrences of externalizing behaviors performed significantly lower on a word-problem measure than students without as many occurrences of externalizing behaviors. Response to the word-problem intervention did not differ based on internalizing behavior patterns.

Quantitative findings revealed an intermediate-high level of procrastination, particularly in relation to writing assignments, exam preparations, and weekly reading tasks, while attendance tasks and general school activities elicited lower procrastination levels. Further analysis elucidated a substantial negative correlation between procrastination behaviors and both academic engagement and self-confidence, indicating the pernicious influence of this pervasive phenomenon on students' academic experiences. Qualitative insights garnered through thematic analysis explicated the complex reasons behind procrastination, including being overwhelmed by intricate tasks, lack of genuine interest, competitive milieu, insecurities, distractions, cultural and familial pressures, and struggles with time management, prioritization, and perfectionism. Furthermore, inadequate mentorship and anxiety surrounding future career prospects emerged as significant contributors to procrastination. Evidently, this detrimental factor not only impeded postgraduates' academic immersion but also eroded their self-confidence, exacerbating the detrimental repercussions on their scholarly performance. Thus, the findings underscore the imperative for targeted interventions, encompassing mentorship, time management skills, and emotional support, to mitigate the deleterious effects of procrastination on Chinese postgraduates' academic engagement and self-confidence.",

Alternative settings by design, as evidenced by West40 student experiences, offer strategies that merit consideration in traditional settings. Youth-serving adults in traditional school settings can consider the four recommendations presented in this report to better support students who are transitioning from an alternative school or are at-risk of dropping out of their traditional school: (1) Provide one significant adult for each student; (2) Improve communication with and for students; (3) Re-evaluate punitive disciplinary measures; and (4) Create positive learning environments.",

        "description":"COVID-19 has been a challenging issue for America's public schools and students. The pandemic highlights many issues that already impacted education but have now become far more transparent as the forced school building shutdowns and transition to online learning have spread across the nation. For the 2020-21 school year, the concern is not only operating schools efficiently and safely but also mitigating the learning loss caused by the pandemic. Some state leaders have asked the U.S. Department of Education to waive the annual federal testing and accountability requirements for 2021. This call follows the mass request and granting of waivers of the federal annual standardized test requirements in the spring of 2020, when schools physically closed, and tests could not be administered. To inform school leaders of waivers of assessment and accountability in 2020, the NSBA's Center for Public Education (CPE) gathered data from the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and compiled this brief. The following report is a summary of the data (as of December 2020) about ED responses to State requests for waivers from requirements under Title I, II, III, and IV-B of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) during the COVID-19 pandemic for both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school year.",

The social issues are 1) difficulty managing time; (2) lack of confidence; (3) harboring issues on their own, so they get stressed quickly, (4) overthinking, (5) relationships with parents that are not good; (6) unhealthy friendships or toxic relationship; (7) there is a misunderstanding with peers; and (8) difficulty adapting to the class schedule and new environment. Problems in these two fields have an impact on the academic field, making students less motivated to learn because of the mismatch between the desires and the majors studied, difficulty dividing time, and difficulty adapting to a new environment, coupled with problems that make new students feel stressed and depressed with their study activities.",

        "description":"This research is motivated by the increasing number of users of android-based learning media it impacts the learning outcomes obtained. This study aims to determine the effect of android-based learning media on improving student learning outcomes. This research is a meta-analysis study. Data collection techniques are taken from indexing databases such as Google Scholar. The filtered data results from research that contains the value of the number of data (N), correlation test (r), and classification, then analyzed using meta-analysis through effect size and standard error to see the summary effect size. The results of data analysis research using JASP software show that the estimation of the summary effect or mean effect size and publication bias test uses a random effect approach. The results of the effect size analysis using the random effects model show that there is a significant positive correlation between the effect of android-based learning media to improve student learning outcomes (z = 4.383; p &lt; 0.001; 95%CI [0.213; 0.559]). Therefore, the influence of android-based learning media on student learning outcomes is included in the low category (rRE = 0.386). In this study, it can be concluded that there is an influence of android-based learning media to improve student learning outcomes where at the 95% confidence level, the p-value &lt;0.05.",

        "description":"USDA helps millions of children from low-income households access healthy meals by purchasing food, including seafood, for the NSLP. USDA-purchased foods represent about 15 to 20 percent of the food served in the NSLP. According to the DGA, programs, such as the NSLP, can play an essential role in providing access to healthy meals. This can help reduce the health risks children may face from consuming a poor diet. Seafood offers particular health benefits, including omega-3 fatty acids, which can aid in the prevention of heart disease. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to review USDA's purchases of seafood for the NSLP. This report discusses: (1) USDA's purchases of seafood for the NSLP; (2) factors affecting selected states' and SFAs' efforts to provide seafood to students; and (3) USDA's efforts to help address these factors.",

        "description":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the disruptive technologies which is being used to customize the experiences of various learning groups, instructors, and tutors. It is considered the most in-demand technology in today's education system. It is expected that AI will enhance the education system worldwide. The educational institutions are nowadays facing various challenges like high dropout rates, unavailability of smart content, lack of customized content as per the textbooks, lack of personalized learning systems, rigid examination patterns etc. The use of AI brings hope to overcome these challenges. It helps to create personalized learning experiences, develop smart content, expand the range of education, and facilitate the management &amp; administration of education by integrating information and disseminating data as per the needs of the target group. With AI, teachers/instructors can identify the learning styles and hard points of students and provide new avenues of teaching and support to students. The current study discusses about AI in various areas of education and its application in Indian education. AI has the potential for enabling students to achieve their goals and streamline the process of education. It can analyse the students' previous learning history, identify their weaknesses, and improve the upcoming learning opportunities for personalized learning experiences. AI can be used effectively for transcription of faculty lectures in local languages which can thus become a good educational resource to students of technical education. The AI tools and programs are inclusive which makes the classrooms accessible to all irrespective of language or any other disabilities.",

Some of the challenges NDE faced with the previous process included a lack of clarity and transparency in the adoption process, content-area review rubrics varied in scope and complexity, content-area review participants' knowledge and understanding of the standards varied within and across content areas causing confusion and disagreement in the review process, and small and rural districts faced additional obstacles to participating in the instructional materials review and adoption process. Rural districts have limited staff capacity to calibrate rubrics and align with the rest of the state, and rural teachers felt their voices were overshadowed by larger districts.",

The VET sector has always prioritised practical experience and face-to-face engagement between learners and trainers, an underpinning characteristic of the sector that has been affected at every level throughout the pandemic. In 2023, it is now clear that while the fundamental structure of VET has remained intact, COVID-19 has significantly reorganised the business practices of training providers and its impacts on the sector will be long-lasting. This research assembles a range of quantitative and qualitative data to map the key impacts of the pandemic on VET students and providers. Student enrolments, outcomes, and satisfaction data from 2020 through to the end of 2021 are compared with pre-pandemic data (2019). Augmenting these data are qualitative findings from consultations with peak body representatives and interviews with training providers from across Australia.",

Survey (R4K!S) is a readiness assessment of children entering kindergarten about students' knowledge and skills within the first six to ten weeks of school. There are many interpretations of what constitutes &quot;readiness.&quot; Vermont's concept of children's readiness is multidimensional; it includes social and emotional development, communication, physical health, as well as cognitive development, knowledge, and approaches to learning (e.g., enthusiasm for learning, persistence, curiosity). Vermont's concept also reflects the belief that &quot;school readiness&quot; is interactional: children need to be ready for schools, and schools need to be ready to accommodate the diverse needs of children. The R4K!S consists of 34 items across the following domains: (1) Physical Development and Health; (2) Social and Emotional Development; (3) Approaches to Learning; (4) Communication; and (5) Cognitive Development. Kindergarten teachers are required to rate each child's skills as &quot;beginning,&quot; &quot;practicing,&quot; or &quot;performing independently&quot; on 28 items in addition to six additional questions related to health and well-being.

        "author":["Frenette, Marc"],
        "description":"Selecting a field of study is an important decision made by thousands of incoming postsecondary students each year. Numerous studies have shown that graduates from engineering, business and mathematics programs earn considerably more than their counterparts from arts and humanities. These earnings disparities may reflect differences in skills that are independent of the programs themselves, rather than supply and demand conditions. Estimating earnings differences between graduates from various programs--net of pre-existing skills differences--is thus a critical first step in understanding the true value associated with the field of study choices. This article informs our understanding of this issue by estimating the earnings differences across various fields of study after adjusting for differences in high school academic performance (course marks), neighbourhood factors (income and educational attainment) and postsecondary institution effects. Using a variety of administrative data sources, British Columbia high school graduates who later completed a postsecondary certificate, diploma or bachelor's degree program in Canada were followed in the labour market for five years after postsecondary graduation. The study found that despite important differences in high school academic performance among individuals who later completed a bachelor's degree, the earnings ranking of the fields of study was not substantially altered after considering the differences in these measures. Interestingly, bachelor's degree graduates of physical and life sciences and technologies programs registered average earnings (for men) or below average earnings (for women) despite being among the top academic performers in high school. By contrast, male and female graduates of business, management and public administration programs were among the highest earners despite registering average academic performance in high school. Among certificate and diploma graduates, earnings differences by field of study were smaller than among their counterparts who graduated with a bachelor's degree, but again, high school academic performance played little to no role in understanding these differences. In general, the remaining earnings differences across postsecondary fields of study may be related to unobserved factors such as noncognitive skills acquired before postsecondary education, or they may signal differences in the supply and demand conditions (i.e., economic returns) associated with these fields. Older survey data show that patterns in selected non-cognitive skills measured in high school are not consistent with the earnings differences by postsecondary field of study estimated in this study, suggesting that supply and demand conditions could explain earnings differences by field of study (as opposed to selection effects).",

        "description":"In today's interconnected world, many career fields--such as diplomacy, national security, and business--need individuals with knowledge about world languages and cultures. To address these areas of needed expertise--both at the federal level as well as in the education, business, and nonprofit sectors--the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, authorizes The Department of Education's Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) and National Resource Center (NRC) grant programs. The US Government Accountability Office was asked to review how these programs support employment in areas of need. Among other issues, this report addresses how selected grantee universities describe encouraging employment in areas of need in their grant applications, and what Education's most recent survey of FLAS graduates shows about respondents' employment outcomes. GAO reviewed relevant application narratives from a non-generalizable sample of 27 NRC grantee universities (25 of which were also FLAS grantees) and grouped employment activities described by grantees into nine categories. These grantees comprised about 23 percent of all fiscal year 2022 NRC and FLAS grantee universities. GAO also analyzed the results from Education's 2019 survey of FLAS graduates, the most recent available. Due to the differences in the structure of the FLAS and NRC programs, Education does not administer a similar survey to NRC grantees. In addition, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and program documents, and interviewed officials from Education.",

        "author":["Nowicki, Jacqueline M."],
        "description":"In recent years, researchers, advocates, parents, and students have raised concerns about equity in school dress codes. Concerns have included the detrimental effects of removing students from the classroom for dress code violations. A committee report accompanying H.R. 7614 included a provision for the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study dress code discipline. This report also addresses a request to study informal removals. This report examines (1) the characteristics of K12 dress codes across school districts nationwide, and how Education supports the design of equitable and safe dress codes; and (2) the enforcement of dress codes, and how Education supports equitable dress code enforcement. To examine characteristics of dress codes, GAO analyzed a nationally representative sample of public school district dress codes. To assess the enforcement of dress codes and how Education supports school districts, GAO analyzed Education data; reviewed relevant studies on dress code discipline; and interviewed academic researchers and officials from national organizations, school districts, and Education. GAO is making four recommendations: (1) The Secretary of Education should provide resources to help districts and schools design equitable dress codes to promote a supportive and inclusive learning environment; (2) The Secretary of Education should include dress code information in existing resources on safe and supportive schools. This information could include examples of dress codes that safeguard students' privacy and body autonomy; (3) The Secretary of Education should provide resources for states, school districts, and schools on the equitable enforcement of discipline, including dress code discipline. These resources should include information that helps states, school districts, and schools address potential disparities and disproportionality in dress code enforcement, as appropriate; and (4) The Secretary of Education should collect information on the prevalence and effects of informal removals and non-exclusionary discipline and disseminate this information to states, school districts, and schools.",

        "description":"Reading comprehension is key to knowledge acquisition and to reinforcing memory for previous information. While reading, a mental representation is constructed in the reader's mind. The mental model comprises the words in the text, the relations between the words, and inferences linking to concepts in prior knowledge. The automated model of comprehension (AMoC) simulates the construction of readers' mental representations of text by building syntactic and semantic relations between words, coupled with inferences of related concepts that rely on various automated semantic models. This paper introduces the second version of AMoC that builds upon the initial model with a revised processing pipeline in Python leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models, additional heuristics for improved representations, as well as a new radiant graph visualization of the comprehension model.",

In 2022, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that research showed more than half of rural counties lacked hospital-based services for pregnant people. GAO also reported on persistent racial and ethnic disparities in maternal death and severe maternal morbidity. Maternal health care providers, such as midwives, can play a critical role in improving maternal health outcomes. GAO was asked to examine midwifery education and access to midwifery care. This report describes information on midwife-attended births, the midwifery workforce, and any challenges to obtaining midwifery care; information on students of midwifery education programs, any midwifery educational challenges, and available federal financial support; and any challenges to measuring the quality of maternal health care, including midwifery care. GAO analyzed data from federal agencies and midwifery education and provider organizations, and reviewed research on midwifery care and education. GAO also interviewed a non-generalizable selection of 15 stakeholders knowledgeable about midwifery care and education, and eight researchers and officials from federal agencies about maternal care quality measures.",

ESEA requires states designate an ombuds to monitor and enforce equitable services requirements. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to review state implementation of the ombuds requirement and equitable services more broadly.

Unfortunately, the positive achievement of getting more children into school has strained the capacity of the system, and student learning has suffered. USAID's 2018 Early Grade Reading Assessment suggests that only 40 percent of students in grades 2 and 3 can read at a satisfactory level of 20-25 words per minute. The lack of printed materials and insufficient support for teachers has resulted in many students failing to acquire basic literacy skills that would allow them to learn other subjects and advance beyond primary school. In partnership with the Ministry of Education and regional state education bureaus, USAID invests in Ethiopia's children and youth to improve reading and reading skills among 15 million students in grades 1-8, and prepare young Ethiopians to lead more prosperous lives. The organization focuses on early grade reading because literacy is at the core of developing young independent thinkers whose academic excellence will enable them to make a meaningful difference in their community and around the world.",

COVID-19 has exacerbated these employment disparities. Despite the increasing number of job vacancies, Canada is at risk of failing to adequately support this emerging talent pool and ensure the country's future economic growth. This report examines the disparity between the high levels of academic success immigrant and refugee youth achieve and the challenges they encounter when seeking to enter the workforce. It also provides several programmatic and policy recommendations to facilitate the inclusion and long-term advancement of immigrant and refugee youth. This report will provide insight into: (1) The challenges immigrant and refugee youth face that often make career development and exploration difficult; (2) Opportunities to support immigrant and refugee youth in their career development journey; and (3) Suggested strategies from research and youth themselves to help ensure success in the Canadian labour market.",

        "description":"Ready for Kindergarten! Survey (R4K!S) is a readiness assessment of children entering kindergarten about students' knowledge and skills within the first six to ten weeks of school. There are many interpretations of what constitutes &quot;readiness.&quot; Vermont's concept of children's readiness is multidimensional; it includes social and emotional development, communication, physical health, as well as cognitive development, knowledge, and approaches to learning (e.g., enthusiasm for learning, persistence, curiosity). Vermont's concept also reflects the belief that &quot;school readiness&quot; is interactional: children need to be ready for schools, and schools need to be ready to accommodate the diverse needs of children. The R4K!S consists of 34 items across the following domains: (1) Physical Development and Health; (2) Social and Emotional Development; (3) Approaches to Learning; (4) Communication; and (5) Cognitive Development. Kindergarten teachers are required to rate each child's skills as &quot;beginning,&quot; &quot;practicing,&quot; or &quot;performing independently&quot; on 28 items in addition to six additional questions related to health and well-being.

Education is responsible for enforcing a prohibition against colleges making these types of statements, when it determines they meet the definition of &quot;substantial misrepresentation.&quot; GAO was asked to review Education's oversight and enforcement of this prohibition. This report examines (1) how Education has organized its oversight activities and enforced this prohibition since the agency created its Student Aid Enforcement Unit in 2016, and (2) the extent to which Education has complete and updated written procedures for enforcing this prohibition. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and Education documents; analyzed Education data for fiscal years 2016 through 2021; and interviewed Education officials. GAO recommends that Education (1) complete written procedures for substantial misrepresentation investigations, including for selecting colleges and conducting investigations; and (2) update written procedures for imposing penalties, as appropriate, on colleges that engaged in substantial misrepresentation. Education agreed with GAO's recommendations.",

The report presents childhood characteristics correlated with high school completion or higher by Indigenous group. Further, using a pooled sample, it examines the association between childhood factors and the outcome using multivariate analysis to account for confounding factors. Indigenous children living in some regions were more likely to complete high school or higher than those in other regions. First Nations (55.0%) and Métis children (66.3%) living in the Prairies region, were less likely to have completed high school or higher by 2016 compared with those in Ontario (68.9% and 77.5%, respectively). Inuit children who were living in Inuit Nunangat (38.1%) were less likely to complete high school or higher education than those living outside Inuit Nunangat (66.5%). Among First Nations and Métis boys and girls, those who were older were almost twice as likely to have completed high school or greater education compared with younger ones. Among Inuit, older boys (56.5%) were more likely to complete high school or higher than younger ones (29.7%E), but this relationship was not seen among girls. In all three groups, children living in suitable housing (i.e., not in crowded housing), were more likely to complete high school or higher education than those in unsuitable housing. This was evident among both Métis and Inuit boys and girls, but only among First Nations boys. The suitability of the housing did not play a significant role in First Nations girls completing high school or higher education. First Nations and Métis children who lived in two-parent households were more likely to complete high school or greater education than those in lone-parent households, but this relationship was not seen among Inuit children. Results of the logistic regression model show that age, household crowding, household income, and academic performance as children are associated with having completed high school or higher education. Older children had nearly three times higher odds (Odds ratio1 or OR=2.75) than those who were younger to have completed high school or higher education. Indigenous boys who lived in unsuitable housing during childhood had nearly half the odds (OR=0.52) of completing high school or higher education than those who lived in suitable housing. While a trend towards increasing odds of high school completion or higher was seen with increasing household income, it was only among Indigenous girls that a significant result was observed. Those living in the third (OR=2.67) and fourth (OR=4.23) quartile of household income had about three and four times, respectively, higher odds of completing high school or higher education compared with those in first quartile of household income. Finally, perceived academic performance in childhood was predictive of high school completion or greater education. In fact, odds of completion increased with increasing academic performance. Boys whose performance was very good during childhood had twice the odds (OR=2.17) of completing high school or higher education than those whose performance was average. In contrast, girls whose performance was very poor or poor had 73% lower odds of completing this level of education than girls whose performance was average. After adjusting for other childhood factors, region of residence, household type, familial residential school experience, prior attendance in an early childhood development program and ability to speak and/or understand an Indigenous language were not significantly associated with completion of high school or greater education. The findings of the study are in line with previous research and offer potential policy levers for developing programs and policies to increase the rates of high school completion or higher education among First Nations children living off reserve, Métis and Inuit children.

The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed the three main CSP grants intended to open or expand charter schools: (1) CSP State Educational Agencies/State Entities; (2) CSP Charter Management Organizations; and (3) CSP Non-State Educational Agencies/Developers. GAO conducted a multivariate statistical analysis to match CSP-grant recipient charter schools with similar non-CSP charter schools to compare enrollment growth. GAO conducted another statistical analysis to compare student subpopulation enrollment differences among CSP grant-recipient schools, non-CSP charter schools, and traditional public schools.

        "description":"The role of state education agencies (SEAs) in leading change to improve student learning has been evolving over several decades. The 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (U.S. Department of Education, 2013) introduced the &quot;statewide system of support&quot; as a framework for guiding the state's role in district and school oversight and assistance. This definition evolved into the more strategic and comprehensive System of Recognition, Accountability and Support (SRAS), which identifies and coordinates key policy levers states have for supporting low-performing districts and schools. Managing the SRAS for performance will not be business as usual. States will need to be deliberate in: (1) Strategically mobilizing all of their tools, including: (a) Building systemic and local capacity for change; (b) Creating opportunity for local agencies to pursue new strategies; (c) Offering incentives to improve; and (d) Intervening in the hardest cases; (2) Differentiating the application of specific tools to deal with schools' and districts' varied performance challenges and trajectories; (3) Including school districts as both partners and targets of reform; and (4) Continually assessing their own efforts and identifying ways to improve their system to more effectively support higher student achievement.

As such, a tool that curates the information and underlines central entities, both authors and articles from a given research context, is highly desirable. Starting from the articles of the International Conference of Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge (LAK) in its first decade, this paper proposes a novel method grounded in Cohesion Network Analysis (CNA) to analyze subcommunities of authors based on the semantic similarities between authors and papers, and estimate their global impact. Paper abstracts are represented as embeddings using a fine-tuned SciBERT language model, alongside a custom trained LSA model. The extrapolation between the local LAK community to a worldwide importance was also underlined by the comparison between the rankings obtained from our method and statistics from ResearchGate. The accuracies for binary classifications in terms of high/low impact predictions were around 70% for authors, and around 80% for articles. Our method can guide researchers by providing valuable information on the interactions between the members of a knowledge community and by highlighting central local authors who may potentially have a high global impact.",

Our aim is twofold: a) to automatically evaluate the quality of paraphrases across four dimensions: lexical similarity, syntactic similarity, semantic similarity and paraphrase quality, and b) to assess how well models trained for this task generalize. The task is modeled as a classification problem and three different methods are explored: (a) manual feature extraction combined with an Extra Trees model, (b) GloVe embeddings and a Siamese neural network, and (c) using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on our task. Starting from a dataset of 1998 paraphrases from the User Language Paraphrase Corpus (ULPC), we explore how the three models trained on the ULPC dataset generalize when applied on a separate, small paraphrase corpus based on children inputs. The best out-of-the-box generalization performance is obtained by the Extra Trees model with at least 75% average F1-scores for the three similarity dimensions. We also show that the Siamese neural network and BERT models can obtain an improvement of at least 5% after fine-tuning across all dimensions.",

        "description":"In 2020, the federal government implemented the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) to provide financial support to employees, self-employed individuals and students directly affected by COVID-19. The CERB was available for individuals who stopped working or were working reduced hours because of COVID-19, and who met various other eligibility criteria. CERB applicants received $2,000 for an initial four-week period and could reapply for additional periods, eventually extending to 28 weeks, for a maximum benefit of $14,000. The benefit covered the period from March 15 to September 26, 2020. The CESB was available to students enrolled in a postsecondary educational program leading to a degree, diploma, or certificate, who were ineligible for the CERB or EI benefits, but met various other eligibility criteria. The benefit was active between May 10 and August 29, 2020. The CESB addressed a gap left by the CERB, which excluded students who were not employed at the start of the pandemic but would typically be looking for work during the summer of 2020. This paper provides insights into the differences in the rate of receipt of CERB and CESB of postsecondary students who received emergency benefit payments in 2020. Emergency benefit receipt is examined along various educational and socio-demographic characteristics to highlight some of the key differences. The analysis is limited to Canadian citizens and permanent residents who were enrolled full-time or part-time in a public postsecondary institution in the fall of 2019 in a program leading to a degree, diploma, or certificate.",

        "description":"High-impact practices (HIPs) are educationally purposeful activities that college students experience in and out of the classroom which are found to be positively related to several learning outcomes including: better gain of academic knowledge and artistic skills, recognition of community issues and real-world problems, career success and leadership building, and community engagement. In arts education, HIPs have been gaining attention as a significant learning experience for nurturing future artists and art professionals who contribute to a wide range of organizations and communities. This report examines a recent study on the association between arts alumni HIP participation and their community engagement outcomes. In examining the association between HIPs and community engagement, the researchers hypothesized that resource allocations between higher education institutions and community partners are critical in providing community-engaged HIP experiences such as working with local artists, service-learning, or internships.",

The annual reporting must include, but is not limited to, the following measures: (1) Student goal attainment and retention; (2) Student persistence; (3) Degree and certificate completion rates; (4) Placement rate of graduates in the workforce; (5) Licensure and certification pass rates; (6) Demonstration of critical literacy skills; (7) Success in subsequent, related coursework; and (8)Number and rate of students who transfer. In an effort to accommodate the mandate set forth in Wyoming statute and to streamline the performance indicator reporting process, the decision was made to specifically address the required performance measures. The Wyoming Community College Commission Statewide Strategic Plan, adopted by the Commission in October 2020, has identified four primary goals and related objectives. All former and current strategic plans center around the Commission's mission. Wyoming community colleges provide dynamic lifelong learning environments through higher education, workforce development, innovative partnerships, and civic and global engagement that lead to responsible citizenship and economic, social, and cultural prosperity. Planning for the future of Wyoming's community colleges and fulfilling the mission of the Wyoming Community College Commission includes providing coordination, advocacy, funding, and accountability. Current goals identified in the 2020-2025 strategic plan include: (1) Educational Attainment -- Facilitate postsecondary educational attainment to the betterment of all Wyoming citizens; (2) Facilitate community college system sustainability, funding, and affordability while keeping higher education as nearly free as possible; (3) Facilitate alignment of post-secondary programs with the University of Wyoming (UW), the workplace, and the workforce to provide a seamless pathway for Wyoming citizens to pursue their employment goals while benefiting the state; and (4) Facilitate initiatives leading to the diversification and growth of Wyoming's economy.

Survey results and previous SNAAP Data Briefs [see ED612788] suggest a gap between alumni's sense of perceived importance and perceived preparedness (the skill preparation gap). Using three logistic regression models, this study investigates the impact of perceived preparedness and skill preparation gaps on three approaches of arts alumni entrepreneurship: freelancing, founding an arts-related venture, and starting a business of any kind. The study also examines other factors such as family resources, race, and student loans in determining whether someone will start a new venture or work as a freelancer to compare with the influence of university training.",

        "description":"Recent research on implementation and effects demonstrates the important difference comprehensive and aligned principal pipelines can make in districts and schools. The implementation studies analyzed in depth how school districts can strategically put in place policies, processes, and infrastructures to strengthen school leadership. Research on achievement effects showed that schools in these districts with newly placed principals outperformed comparison schools to a statistically significant and meaningful extent over three years. This guide is built on the research evidence. Because many districts have already put in place key pipeline elements and want to know where there is room for improvement, this guide was created to help districts reflect on their policies, processes, and infrastructures related to school leadership and begin planning for improvement. It provides a set of evidence-based indicators of pipeline functioning and a framework for applying the indicators through self-study. Districts rate their own status on each indicator as a step in their decision making and planning. This guide is designed to help in improving any school district's principal pipeline, recognizing that structures for advancement and support differ across districts. The guide encourages district decision makers to consider the quality of the design and implementation of their own structural arrangements and how well these work as a system. Districts that have principal pipelines find that alignment across the domains of leadership development lends important coherence to their work and can advance district-wide progress.",

Sustaining a pipeline requires attending to the following six elements--as defined by the authors based on research and practitioners' ideas--and this guide offers a framework for addressing them through self-study and planning: (1) Financial planning; (2) Partnerships; (3) Stakeholder involvement; (4) District policies and procedures; (5) Continuous improvement and evaluation; and (6) Communications. The guide describes each element and suggests discussion questions and local evidence for district teams to consider in assessing how well their district is currently addressing the element. A template at the end of the guide allows districts to identify sustainability elements they want to strengthen and to make a plan for the sustainability work they want to prioritize. The guide also includes a financial planning template that districts can use to account for the &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; funding sources available to support both the one-time and ongoing costs of the pipeline. That template also guides districts in assessing their pipeline's vulnerability to financial trouble based on the district's financial plan.",

        "description":"Entering the middle of the 21st Century, Texas has the ninth-largest economy in the world, whose success is powered by the increasingly educated workforce. Texans have earned more degrees, certificates, and credentials over the past decade than at any time in history, and Texas has outpaced every other state in growing undergraduate and graduate student enrollment. But the economy is always changing. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated trends that were already underway in how Texans learn, work, connect, and use technology. And, now more than ever before, a growing number of jobs require credentials beyond high school diplomas. To meet these challenges, Texas institutions of higher education must expand opportunities for all Texans to earn degrees, certificates, and other credentials. More specifically, the state must lead the nation in awarding credentials of value that offer purpose in the economy, value in the labor market, and opportunities for good jobs and meaningful careers. The plan will focus on three measurable, data-driven goals: (1) Attainment of Postsecondary Credentials; (2) Postsecondary Credentials of Value; and (3) Research, Development, and Innovation. In the plan, equity will be embedded throughout the goals. All goals will be tied to metrics that are publicly available for students and families, colleges and universities, employers, and policymakers to use in making decisions. These goals can only be achieved collaboratively, working with public and private sector stakeholders to break down historic silos and serving as a resource, partner, and advocate for Texas higher education.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns about the possibility of increased staff attrition from the public school sector, as it did for other occupations during the Great Resignation that followed the pandemic's onset. Recruiting and retaining education staff were pressing challenges even before the pandemic began. Since March 2020, education staff have needed to adapt to new job expectations and risk exposure to an unknown virus. These factors might have contributed to staff leaving public education jobs due to mental and physical health concerns and other issues. This research brief describes staff attrition during the pandemic from Pennsylvania local education agencies (LEAs). The brief describes annual rates of staff leaving the statewide public school sector from several jobs--including teachers, health and counseling staff, school administrators, and LEA administrators--and how changes in attrition during the pandemic varied with staff, school, and LEA characteristics. Key findings for teachers, health and counseling staff, and administrators include: (1) five percent of staff working in Pennsylvania local education agencies (LEAs) in fall 2020 left the statewide public school sector by fall 2021, an increase from 4 percent attrition in preceding years; (2) pre-pandemic attrition rates for staff of color were generally higher than for non-Hispanic White staff, and these differences grew during the pandemic except for school administrators, where they narrowed; and (3) gaps in attrition rates were also exacerbated during the pandemic for teachers and health and counseling staff early in their careers and in charter schools and for LEA administrators in large LEAs.

        "description":"To enable students majoring in translation at the College of Languages and Translation to read, identify the lexical and syntactic features of legal documents and hence comprehend their content, this article proposes an instructional module for teaching English for Legal Purposes (ELP). The module should be based on the assessment of the students' proficiency level in English and analysis of their academic and professional need. It consists of the most common legal terms such as (alias, amicus, peosequi, res judicata, puisine, puis ne, estoppel fee, simple laches, quash); grammatical structures common in legal documents such as the use of long and complex sentences, conditional clauses, adverbial clusters, long complicated nominal groups, the modal auxiliary shall, and French word order (court martial, heir apparent, secretary general); reading legal documents such as insurance policies, wills, statutes, contracts and agreements between individuals, leases, petitions, investigations...etc. Global legal themes are integrated in the practice material. The students practice listening, speaking, reading, writing and translation. They learn the legal terms and grammatical structures in context (through the text). The instructor performs text analysis. Together with the students, she goes through a legal text, locates legal terms and syntactic structures, and explains and/or translates them. Then the students perform text analysis of new legal texts. Numerous technologies can be integrated into teaching and learning ELP. Assignments are posted on Blackboard LMS, a blog or a social media page. At the end of the instructional period, the students are tested, and the ELP module is evaluated by the students and legal translation instructors. The article recommends that ELP be student-centered. The students should have an active role in the learning process where they select legal topics to read, talk, write about and translate.",

Students typically subscribe to podcasts using &quot;podcatcher&quot; software such as iTunes. The present study proposes a model for integrating grammar podcasts in teaching English grammar to EFL/ESL college students. It gives examples of English grammar podcasts that can be integrated in in-class grammar instruction. It shows how grammar podcasts can be downloaded and used and some of the grammatical structures and topics are covered by those podcasts. Grammar podcasts contain 2-5-minute-long audio explanations of a particular grammatical point or structure. They include a lesson script, exercises, quizzes with an answer key, and/or an English grammar help where answers are given to students' questions about problematic grammatical points. Students can download podcasts, print the script, do the exercises and score their answers themselves. Elementary, intermediate, and advanced level grammar podcasts can be downloaded depending on the students' needs and proficiency level. Unlike face-to-face classroom lectures, students can listen to grammar podcasts anywhere, anytime and as many times as they need. Classroom discussions on a grammar podcast can be performed in pairs, small groups or even whole class. End-of-semester grammar tests can be given to find out improvements in the students' grammatical knowledge/achievement as a result of integrating grammar podcasts in EFL grammar courses. Recommendations for the effective use of grammar podcasts are given.",

        "description":"The disruptions to schooling created by the COVID-19 pandemic prompted nationwide concern about negative impacts on academic proficiency, particularly for vulnerable student populations. Pennsylvania's 2021 statewide assessments offered the first opportunity since the pandemic began to assess how students across the Commonwealth were faring, whether achievement gaps had widened, and how remote learning affected student performance. As in other states, the raw assessment data did not tell the full story of the pandemic's impacts on academic proficiency. Fewer Pennsylvania students participated in the 2021 assessments than in prior years, and test takers were not a representative sample of all students. In addition, test administration dates varied widely across the state in 2021, with some local education agencies (LEAs) postponing the usual spring assessments to the fall. Using a predictive model that accounts for the unique assessment issues in 2021 and the instructional modes that Pennsylvania LEAs offered, this research brief provides a fuller picture of the pandemic's impacts on academic proficiency in grades 5 through 8. Key findings for Pennsylvania students in grades 5 through 8 include: (1) students in vulnerable groups and in fully remote learning had lower assessment participation rates than other students in 2021; (2) the pandemic led to a substantial reduction in academic proficiency statewide in 2021, reducing academic achievement even more than the results for tested students indicated (3) the pandemic had consistently large negative academic effects across student groups, including for vulnerable groups that had low rates of proficiency before the pandemic; and (4) LEAs that were fully remote after winter break saw lower proficiency rates in 2021, compared with LEAs that offered fully in-person learning to similar students.

When one tries to look, most research points to art therapy strategies which leave art educators feeling ill-equipped to implement in their classrooms. This study explored the implementation of visual journaling, an art therapy technique, in a high school classroom to see what the role the educator took on, the stress effect on students as a group and individually, and if it simultaneously had any academic benefits. The researcher gauged the effectiveness of the visual journaling therapeutically by measuring student stress before and after the activity, showing that it did in fact reduce stress in most students. This varied for students based on their individualized approach where some students appreciated prompts as starters while others wanted more open-ended choices. The researcher also weighed the academic benefits of the activity, showing that students felt more creative in other classroom art projects from their use of their visual journals. The visual-journaling technique shows to be effective as a social emotional strategy in the art classroom.",

In 2019, the most recent revision of this subject was adopted. It was labelled SAF01-04, and came into effect in August 2020. This article aims to identify areas where SAF01-04 implicitly encourages pupils to take specific normative positions in contested political-ideological questions. The article concludes that the implicit political-ideological content in SAF01-04 is moderately politically left-leaning and that pupils are expected to adopt moderately left-leaning positions. The article concludes that the ideological leanings of SAF01-04 are surprising given that the government behind SAF01-04 was centre-right.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 virus brought on a public health emergency that massively disrupted school systems and learning nationwide. During the 2020-2021 school year, many local education agencies (LEAs) in Pennsylvania and other states adopted remote learning to help slow the virus's spread. However, remote learning came with challenges for students, families, and LEAs. These challenges included very practical ones like not having a reliable internet connection or the correct link to log into classes, as well as fatigue from so many remote meetings and feelings of social isolation. This brief examines remote learning in Pennsylvania and its role in shaping education outcomes and COVID-19 case rates in local communities during the 2020-2021 school year. Key findings for the 2020-2021 school year: (1) Vulnerable groups of students were more likely than students overall to attend LEAs where the predominant instructional modes included remote learning; (2) The same groups of students were also more likely to be in LEAs where larger shares of the student population had trouble accessing reliable internet; (3) More remote learning was associated with lower assessment performance in grades 5-8, especially in schools with higher levels of economic disadvantage. It was also associated with lower suspension rates in grades 6-12 and did not appear to harm or help graduation rates; and (4) Remote learning in high school was associated with lower subsequent COVID-19 rates within an LEA's boundary, suggesting it had an important public health benefit.

        "author":["Pendergrass, Susan"],
        "description":"Open enrollment is a form of school choice that gives families the opportunity to choose an educational setting or school within the public school system that is best for their children. In U.S. public school districts, students typically must attend the school that is in their neighborhood and often do not have a choice of attending a different school if there is not an open enrollment option. Open enrollment options, however, vary by state and region. Open enrollment can be either intra-district or inter-district. &quot;Intra-district open enrollment&quot; allows students to transfer to another school within their resident district. &quot;Inter-district open enrollment&quot; allows students to transfer to another public school district, even if they live outside the choice district's attendance boundaries. This paper will describe trends in elementary and secondary enrollment and financing and how those trends interact with open enrollment in the US. Then it describes the open enrollment landscape at both the state and district level. It then reviews the available literature on the participation and impact these policies have on students and school systems, followed by detailed case studies of inter-district choice programs in Arizona, Florida, Indiana, and Ohio to understand and gain insight on the processes and perceptions of administrators in the state. Finally, policy implications for improving access to and the impact of opening district boundaries will be summarized.",

It follows Cooper's (1988) steps for synthesising the literature. The review begins by examining definitions of conceptions of learning, a process that enables analysis of the quantitative and qualitative dichotomy. It then moves to the potential interrelationship between various conceptions, more specifically, the hierarchical structure proposed by researchers. In the following section, it explores the significance of conceptions of learning by examining the close relationship between learning conceptions and learning approaches. Next, the review focuses on the conceptions of learning uncovered in the Asian contexts, particularly the Chinese context. The article concludes that studies on the conceptions of learning are meaningful and conceptually helpful, thereby calling for more empirical and theoretical works.",

There are two recognizable learning environments for students: classroom and laboratory environments. With the COVID-19 Pandemic, both environments merged to online environments, impacting students' processes and characteristic attitudes development. This paper introduces a theoretical framework based on experiential learning to plan and deliver processes online. A case study based on the power-factor correction experiment was presented. The traditional experiment that runs for 2 hours was broken into smaller tasks such as pre-lab activity, simulation exercise, PowerPoint presentation, remote laboratory activity, and final report based on the experiential learning approach. The delivery of the lab under online mode delivery was presented. Then students' performance was compared before and after the online mode of delivery. It was found that students' performance on average has a distinct improvement. In order to obtain students' reflections about the online experiential learning approach, a questionnaire that carries close and open-ended questions was administered. The majority of the students liked the approach followed and praised for allowing them to experiment in a novel way during the COVID-19.",

The first proposed explanation is flexibility in certification, while the second and third have to do with flexibility in hiring.",

        "description":"Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education pertains to using information and communication technology to support, enhance, and optimize information delivery. The study sought to ascertain the ICT competencies of elementary teachers in District 2 of the SDO Malolos City. The study employed a descriptive-quantitative method. The standardized questionnaire was adopted from the National ICT Competency Standards for Teachers (NICS), which covered the four domains of the ICT framework in education. Data were analyzed using the mean Kruskal-Wallis Test and the Mann-Whitney U test to determine significant differences between teacher respondents' profile and their level of National ICT Competency Standards. Results showed that teachers have a high level of competencies in Technology Operations and Concepts, Social and Ethical, and Pedagogical Domains, but an average level in the Professional domain. Likewise, a significant difference was not established in their gender, age, educational attainment, position, number of ICT-related training, and years of using ICT in teaching but found in teachers' length of service. The findings suggest that teachers must increase their level of competence in the Professional Domain to become more proficient and effective in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. This can be accomplished through seminar workshops on professional growth and development, research, innovation, and collaboration. To maximize their ICT skills, a competency-based training program should be provided in District 2 of SDO City of Malolos schools.",

        "author":["Stockwell, Glenn"],
        "description":"Despite the large amount of research that has taken place with mobile devices for language learning over the years, there are still limited conclusions that can be reached as to what contributes to sustained task engagement. A common problem that has long been seen in the CALL literature is that many tasks and activities that are reported are small scale studies taking place in a single environment with a limited number of subjects, often as a result of teachers investigating the outcomes of their own teaching (see Warschauer, 1997; Hubbard, 2005). Given the nature of the environments in which many teachers find themselves, it is in some way inevitable that studies tend to be of a smaller scale and often undertaken within a single class. It is possible to gain deeper insights into the tasks used through replication studies (Porte, 2012). This paper discusses the potential insights gained from replicating approximately the same basic language learning tasks in varied contexts. Research on vocabulary and listening tasks was carried out in Japan over an 8-year period from 2010 through 2017 for Japanese learners of English. In addition, the same tasks were adapted for Australian learners of Japanese in 2012 and Taiwanese learners of English in 2013, with a total of 420 participants. Data were collected through post-treatment surveys, semi-structured interviews and server logs recording the times spent on the tasks, the scores achieved, and the devices used to engage in the tasks. The same methods of data collection were used in each of the studies, using primarily the same tasks apart from adaptations made for developments in technology and for the different language learning contexts. Carrying out the same tasks in subsequent years with increasingly newer technologies and with teachers and learners from different cultural backgrounds provided insights into the effect of the context, the technology, and role of both teachers and learners in successfully implementing the tasks.",

        "author":["Scafidi, Benjamin"],
        "description":"The Indiana Choice Scholarship Program (ICSP), which began in fall 2011, is a state taxpayer-funded financial aid program that helps low and lower-middle income Hoosiers to send their children to the private K-12 school of their choice. This voucher program has been extremely popular among families, as the number of students receiving scholarships has increased from 3,911 students in academic year (AY) 2012 to 36,707 by 2020. This report addresses two questions regarding the fiscal effects of the ICSP up through and including academic year (AY) 2020: (1) The fiscal effects of the ICSP on the state of Indiana budget; and (2) The fiscal effects of the ICSP on local school corporation budgets (in Indiana public school districts are termed &quot;school corporations&quot;). The estimates in this report suggest that the ICSP has provided modest fiscal benefits to taxpayers to date--however, the fiscal savings per scholarship recipient are quite large. Therefore, as more students access the ISCP the savings to Indiana taxpayers will increase significantly. The major findings include: (1) The ICSP saved state taxpayers a total of $42.5 million in 2019-20. These savings translate to savings of $1,158 per scholarship student--a significant sum on a per student basis; and (2) The ICSP yielded a total of $60.6 million in savings to local public school corporations in 2017-18, which was the most recent year with complete data available. These savings to local school corporations were $1,709 per student. These findings are not surprising given that the average scholarship awards are below both total expenditures per student and state per pupil funding as well.",

With access to vast amounts of data on their programs, workforce training providers can leverage their management information systems (MIS) to understand and improve their programs' outcomes. By predicting which participants are at greater risk of dropping out of their program and why, providers can segment their caseloads so that participants receive services better tailored to their needs. Within the data science field, machine learning (ML) has gained popularity for its ability to extract hidden patterns without being explicitly guided by a data analyst. While these data science methods hold promise, are the added costs and complexity worth it? The authors explore the tradeoffs by answering the following questions: (1) What factors are important in predicting a participant's outcome in a program?; (2) Are participant outcomes predictable using simple methods, like creating basic risk indicators in Management Information Systems (MIS)? For example, how well does an indicator for prior education predict participant outcomes?; and (3) What is the added value and cost of incorporating regression and more complex machine learning methods?",

Yet unemployment among young people ages 16 to 29 years was well above the overall unemployment rate. In 2016, 8.2 percent of this group were unemployed, while the national average was 4.9 percent. However, among Black young adults it was even higher: 13.8 percent. Indeed, unemployment among young Black men was more than triple the national average. To help address racial inequity and increase employment among young people, workforce development systems and other systems that serve young adults would need to change. Given this context, in 2016, the Annie E. Casey Foundation launched Generation Work™ to connect more young adults--especially young people of color from families with low incomes--with meaningful employment by changing the way public and private systems prepare them and support their search for jobs. As part of the initiative, it asked partnerships made up of key workforce organizations in five cities to change how their workforce systems operated by better aligning education, training, and support services across organizations, and weaving into their systems best practices related to employers and youth. This report examines the first five years of the initiative as implemented by five partnerships.",

        "description":"This book proposes an innovative theoretical and practical model to promote green education in primary schools, focusing on inspiring teachers to design and execute effective green education activities. This model was pilot-tested with over 60 teachers in Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia. The book is divided into four chapters. The first examines the national baseline of green education in the named countries and global trends. Chapter two presents chosen methods for promoting green education, including educational space design, rituals, multimedia resources, project and game-based learning, outdoor activities, and external speakers. The third chapter outlines a methodological framework for a training course to prepare primary teachers for green education, providing an analysis of the pilot training, its scope, implementation, and evaluation. Lastly, the fourth chapter presents the 'Green Schools Model' and discusses European and international trends in this area, concluding with additional recommendations for school leaders. The results reveal that the proposed model, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and circular economy goals, is effective in promoting sustainability and environmental consciousness among primary school teachers and their students. These findings carry significant implications for policy and practice in green education, underscoring the need for a focused and coordinated effort to instill a sense of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. This work suggests future studies on a broader scale and deeper analysis of individual components of the model for further refinement. It contains 85 references, numerous tables, graphs, and images to aid comprehension, as well as an appendix with additional materials and test instruments. By equipping teachers with practical tools and insights, this book makes a critical contribution towards creating future change agents, pivotal in addressing our planet's environmental challenges. [This publication is created within the European project &quot;Green Schools&quot;, which includes three organizations: the Bulgarian Union of Teachers (SEB), Teachers Union of Serbia (TUS) and the Trade Union of Teachers in Romania (FSLI).

The study uses the researcher's informed reflection as a method. The informed reflector role allows the researcher to explore realities from multiple dimensions by scanning existing teaching and learning scholarship.

The goal of this study is to find out how IIUM postgraduate students balanced Qur'an memorization and working activities during their studies, to identify the difficulties they faced, and to find out how they balanced Qur'an memorization and working activities. A case study was used in this study to create a qualitative design. The data was collected via methodical triangulation, and the data was gathered through verbal interviews. Two postgraduate students from IIUM were chosen to be interviewed. Thematic analysis was used to examine the data. The keywords were determined once the data from the interviews were transcribed. The researchers then identified the theme for further investigation before analyzing the data. The findings revealed that these students value Qur'an memorization but that there is no timetable for memorizing the whole Qur'an due to their busy schedules.",

Researchers can retrieve relevant articles by author, identify those of interest, and follow their research in order to receive timely material. They can also find articles by topic, and in many cases, articles are available full-text. Additionally, ResearchGate has given scholars the exposure that they need for promotion and tenure. Unlike many library-based retrieval systems, ResearchGate is easy to use and is not protected by a firewall; any university affiliated scholar can develop a scholar profile. Unfortunately, some scholars are finding that it is easier and faster to publish their manuscripts on ResearchGate, and this could change the already volatile publishing industry in numerous ways. Librarians, students, and scholars need to be aware of ResearchGate and how it can impact the use of library-supplied databases.",

Twenty-five (25) FBS NC II trainees from General Santos National School of Arts and Trades participated in the study; 72% were female, 28% were aged 21-25, and 72% were college graduates. Trainers, assessors, and industry experts evaluated the modules. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and weighted mean were employed to answer study issues and examine evaluator ratings. The competencies of preparing the dining area, promoting food and beverage, and providing room service are the least mastered. There is a significant difference in these competencies based on sex with t-3.017, p-0.012 and age with t-5.081, p-0.005, but not on educational achievement f-1.856, p-0.160. Required knowledge, skills, and (STEM) Competencies were identified based on the training regulation of the qualification. The correlation test showed p-values greater than 0.05, supporting the null hypothesis that mean gain scores on evaluating localize modules with STEM competencies in objectives, concepts, skills, usability, appropriateness, and adequacy are not significantly different. Thus, it is recommended that the localized module be tested in the training of FBS NC II and employed in the subsequent study.",

ESAs allow parents to withdraw their children from public district or charter schools and receive a deposit of public funds into government-authorized savings accounts with restricted, but multiple, uses. The characteristics of Nebraska's private school sector can inform policy debates surrounding the potential creation of educational choice programs, such as ESAs. From March 31 to May 23 2022, EdChoice administered a survey of Nebraska private school leaders.

        "description":"Opponents of education choice often make two arguments about its effect on rural areas: (1) education choice will not help in rural areas because there are few or no alternatives to the district school system; and (2) education choice will destroy the district school system because so many students will leave for alternative options. These two claims are mutually exclusive. They cannot both be true, but they can both be--and indeed are--false. The dearth of education options in rural areas has been greatly exaggerated. About seven in 10 rural families live within 10 miles of a private elementary school. Children in rural areas can attend charter schools in states with policies that have fostered the creation of charters in rural areas. In Arizona, more than eight in 10 students live in the same zip code as at least one charter school. Rural areas are seeing the rise of microschools, a modern reimagining of the one-room schoolhouse. Additionally, high-quality virtual schools are available to anyone with a decent Internet connection--which is becoming increasingly available in rural America. Families in rural areas have access to more education options than ever before. The most recent data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress for Arizona--the state with the greatest access to education choice--do not support the claim that education choice has been harmful to the rural district schools. Indeed, the best available evidence indicates that education choice is the rising tide that lifts all boats. Policymakers who want to increase education options for rural families should enact education choice policies, such as K-12 education savings accounts, and broaden charter school laws to make it easier to open them in rural areas.",

        "description":"The Association of Public &amp; Land-grant Universities (APLU) launched the &quot;Powered by Publics: Scaling Student Success&quot; initiative in the fall of 2018. The South Eastern Cluster brought together a diverse set of institutions from this region of the country that included several of the larger universities, the North Carolina System Office and its regional universities, as well as a group of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in this region. The South Eastern Cluster decided that the success of transfer students should be the focus for improving student success at their institutions. In this report, the authors provide insights and a view across institutions as to how the cluster works with state agencies and each other to provide students pathways across institutions, programming in support of their success, and the work done to develop key metrics for assessment. The authors provide some detail on the perspectives of the four states on the transfer of credit, as well as detailing some of the key transfer student success programs and initiatives that have been implemented at each of the institutions and across the North Carolina System of institutions. They also provide some reflection on the difficulties encountered in developing a comparable transfer student success data set across institutions, much of this difficulty resulting from a lack of consistency in defining the metrics used for assessment. Finally, they provide some insight into lessons learned from this collaboration and on how institutions focus on student success. The authors' hope is that other academic leaders can find some takeaways for building successful programs and initiatives at their institutions, leading to the success of transfer students, with more of them obtaining their degrees.",

It is also an introduction to both concrete thinking and abstract one, which is rather about ideas and general thought. Abstraction is one of the steps ap- plied for design learning processes because it may improve students' capacity for creative thinking. In practice, architects may use abstraction to sim- plify complex design problems and create clear, concise solutions. Basic Design Studio at Faculty of Architecture, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Vakif University (FSMVU), has dealt with the task of abstraction, while each generation's initial phase changed. This paper aims to define basic steps that guided students in FSMVU to apply abstraction in developing their final design, starting from objects from nature to geometrically defined shapes.",

The first Phase was the quantitative Phase, in which Pearson product-moment correlation was carried out to understand the relationship between the variables. One hundred teacher educators are teaching B.Ed. A stratified sampling technique selected the course. The second Phase was the qualitative Phase, in which only 20 teacher educators were randomly selected and interviewed to understand the problems faced by teacher educators in teaching &amp; conducting research. The present study's findings revealed a significant and positive relationship between researcher-like disposition and teaching effectiveness of teacher educators, and the researcher-like disposition has positively contributed to enhancing the teaching effectiveness of teacher educators (p&lt;0.01 level). However, the findings also revealed that the teaching workload, inadequate research pre-service training, infrastructure constraints, Lack of training in ICT, and involvement in other administrative work were the various factors affecting teaching effectiveness and research performance. In a rapidly changing teaching and learning scenario, conducting research is one of the most potential approaches and thoughtful ways to inspire, motivate, and equip teacher educators with skills to teach evidence-based methods. The result of the present study provides a clear picture to the educationists and policymakers to improve the teaching effectiveness and research performance of teacher educators teaching in B.Ed.

Affordable childcare from a variety of providers, including at-home options, access to high-quality K-12 education that reflects a family's values, a higher education landscape that provides numerous routes to upward mobility, and flexible work arrangements will give couples the confidence that they can have the number of children they desire. Public policy should support families as they form and grow, and can do so through reducing government regulatory overreach, directly funding students instead of institutions, and by removing barriers to a flexible workforce. Ultimately, these reforms will support couples as they raise their children to become productive members of a free society.",

        "description":"Many welfare programs give greater benefits to unmarried individuals than to a married couple of otherwise identical income. The resulting marriage penalty discourages marriage and rewards single parenthood. Combined marriage penalties across federal and state welfare programs can reach tens of thousands of dollars per year for a given family. One component of the marriage penalties comes from state-level free or subsidized preschool programs. In addition to a failed track record in providing high-quality preschool education, the majority of government-funded preschool programs also have severe marriage penalties. Marriage is highly beneficial to adults, children, and society as a whole. Policymakers should consider the implications of their programs on marriage and design policies that do not discourage marriage, and, in fact, actively promote marriage and support married couples with children.

        "description":"Crises have a way of shaking up the status quo and creating space for new thinking. When shocked out of their familiarity, people start to ask questions as to why things are the way that they are and brainstorm ways to make them better. Enter entrepreneurs. They are the people who take those ideas that are lying around and attempt to create solutions to the problems blasted open by crises. The pandemic was a crisis for American education. From 2019 to 2022 the average fourth grade math score dropped 5 scale score points, falling to the lowest level since 2005. In eighth grade, the average math score dropped 8 points, the lowest they have been since 2003. Entrepreneurs responded to the pandemic with gusto. The Prenda microschool network started in 2013 but tripled in size during the pandemic. Parents looking for smaller, more responsive education environments met a platform that was ready for them. The Art of Problem Solving, a content provider known originally for its high-level math courses, leaned into the pandemic, flooding their website with resources for parents and building out the functionality of their products. Now emerging from the pandemic, it is an opportune time to take stock of exactly where the world of educational entrepreneurship stands. What are the headwinds and what are the tailwinds? Where is entrepreneurship succeeding and where it is struggling? To answer these questions, EdChoice partnered with Hanover Research to survey 59 educational entrepreneurs working today to find out about their experiences. This paper shares the results of that survey.",

It aims to give insight into the priorities of the education funding community, and to help funders understand their role in supporting education innovation that benefits the nation's learners. The findings in this report are based on survey responses representing 142 grantmaking organizations, 70% of which are EdFunders members. Among the key findings are: (1) Funders' expanded approach to the social-emotional needs of learners includes addressing trauma and the negative impacts of racial injustice; (2) Funders have major concerns about the politicization of education; (3) Funders' growing desire to overhaul the education system reflects a wide range of approaches; (4) Equity remains a priority; (5) Public policy is an area of focus in spite of less favorable local contexts; (6) Interest in funder collaboration is not matched by levels of funding; and (7) Funders increase efforts to be responsive to power dynamics, grantee perspectives and youth voice in funding decisions.

The bivariate statistical analysis confirms a significant positive relationship between the values of Self-transcendence and Openness to Change with the attitudes of pre-service teachers toward inclusive education. It emerged that the more a teacher approves of these values, the more she tends to favor of attitudes related to inclusive education. The results of this study suggest that values should be considered in teacher training programs to improve the implementation of inclusive education policies.",

A total of 60 general education teachers participated in the survey. The research tool used was the questionnaire and knowledge were measured by closed-ended questions, which would have a 5-point Likert format (1 = &quot;agree&quot; to 5 = &quot;disagree&quot;). In the present research: (1) teachers' perceptions of inclusive education for autistic children in general education classes were studied; and (2) the relationships between individual and demographic teacher characteristics. and their perceptions of inclusion. An important finding of the statistical analysis of the results was that teachers were generally found to have a relatively moderate level of knowledge, as assessed by a 48-question questionnaire. In addition, it was found that gender, educational level, and participation in autism education programs did not appear to significantly influence teachers' scores on this questionnaire.",

The infusion of substantial, highly flexible pots of federal relief dollars created an opportunity to pilot new programs and initiatives. Many states and districts opted to invest resources in traditional K-12 expenses, such as increasing staff capacity or updating facilities. However, states are also using the funds to spark new initiatives that otherwise may not have been possible and can be replicated across the country. This Policy Guide presents six strategies along with state examples to assist in planning, designing, implementing, and sustaining innovative services and programs. In addition to these strategies, other researchers have developed models for change that put forward other unique approaches, such as allowing for locally driven variation, providing human capital support for ongoing technical assistance and tolerating small-scale risk. The end goal of using these approaches is to design innovative policies that endure and improve long-term student outcomes.",

They help paint a holistic picture of student experiences--and inform school improvement in areas like engagement, climate, and culture. Minnesota has given a statewide youth survey since 1989. While it has provided some key insights over the years, it would be even more valuable if it was more relevant to and used by those who work with youth each day--educators, families, and students themselves. In this paper, we report on conversations with dozens of survey &quot;users&quot; in Minnesota, a 50-state analysis of student surveys around the country, and present recommendations. In short, our core recommendation is to shift the central purpose of Minnesota's student survey to improving learning and schools. This shifted central purpose is most likely to directly benefit youth. Practically speaking it is also the purpose that most naturally leads to meeting all other purposes--by maintaining the participation rates and political support that will be necessary for the survey's survival.

We examined learning experiences during the 2020-2021 school year and the impact the pandemic has had on high school student grade point average (GPA), including predictors of change in GPA from 2019-2020 to 2020-2021. Method: Participants were 238 adolescents (55.5% male), 49.6% with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in the United States. Adolescents reported on their GPAs via online surveys. Results: GPA significantly decreased on average from 2019-2020 to 2020-2021 school year. ADHD status and biological sex significantly moderated change--students with ADHD and male students reported decreased GPA, whereas students without ADHD and female students' GPA did not change. Low income and Black/Latinx students had lower GPAs in both school years. Conclusion: It is imperative that additional supports be provided for at-risk students to help them catch up on missed learning during the pandemic.

        "description":"It is unknown whether sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is prospectively associated with depression in adolescence, and possible processes linking SCT to depression remain unexamined. Using a longitudinal study with three timepoints over a two-year period, the current study tested the indirect effects of SCT on depression via peer victimization, specifically physical, relational, and verbal victimization. Participants were 302 adolescents (M[subscript age] = 13.17 years; 44.7% female participants; 81.8% White; 52% with ADHD). In the fall of 8th grade, adolescents and parents completed measures of adolescents' SCT and ADHD symptoms. Adolescents completed a measure of peer victimization in spring of 8th grade and a measure of depressive symptoms in 10th grade. Models examining indirect effects were conducted with and without control of baseline ADHD and/or depressive symptoms. Across analyses, adolescent and parent ratings of SCT symptoms uniquely predicted greater depressive symptoms two years later when controlling for adolescent sex, study site, and either 8th grade depressive or ADHD symptoms. Further, adolescents' self-reported 8th grade SCT symptoms predicted 10th grade depressive symptoms via verbal victimization when controlling for 8th grade ADHD symptoms, but not in analyses incorporating 8th grade depressive symptoms. Findings underscore the predictive association of SCT on depressive symptoms, the possible role of adverse peer relationships as a mechanism linking SCT to depression, and the importance of considering ADHD and depressive symptoms in research on longitudinal correlates of SCT.

Given school-based bullying programs' focus on bystanders, understanding the associations between school-level factors and individual bystander responses can improve intervention efficacy. Data from 64,670 adolescents were used to examine bullying bystander responses as a function of 13 school-climate dimensions within 3 main factors (Engagement, Environment, Safety) and individual-level factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, perceptions of student-teacher connectedness). Multi-level models showed schools with better Engagement and Safety had higher odds of defender behaviors, a better Environment was associated with lower odds of passive and assisting behaviors. Differences also varied by individual-level factors. For example, an aggressive climate was associated with passive behaviors more strongly in boys and high schoolers. Further, higher perceived parent-teacher and student-teacher connectedness were associated with positive bystander behaviors, and this was stronger for Black and Latinx youth, highlighting the importance of improving relationships as a crucial starting point.

During the 2019-2020 school year, both grant programs served a total of 24 preschool programs consisting of 9,864 students with 29% of those students qualifying as eligible students as defined in statute. Overall, students entering kindergarten from high-quality public programs had a higher proportion of students proficient in both Literacy and Numeracy compared to students entering from non-high-quality public programs. High-quality program participants performed at higher levels than the state average in Literacy. Both groups performed at lower levels than the state average in Numeracy. Due to disruptions from COVID-19, the Preschool Entry Exit Profile (PEEP) exit assessment was not administered in the 2019-2020 school year.

Participants/Methods: Participants were 137 adolescents (ages 13-15 years; 64% male). Approximately half (47.4%; n=65) were diagnosed with ADHD. Adolescents provided ratings of their dispositional mindfulness and brooding rumination. Both adolescents and parents provided ratings of adolescents' sleep problems. Results: In analyses controlling for sex, race, study site, and group (ADHD vs. comparison), brooding rumination was associated with more adolescent- and parent-reported sleep problems only at low levels of dispositional mindfulness. This effect did not differ for adolescents with or without ADHD and was also unchanged when controlling for internalizing psychopathology symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings showed that dispositional mindfulness might buffer against the negative impact of brooding rumination on adolescent sleep. These findings may have important clinical implications and underscore the potential benefit of including mindfulness and other cognitive-behavioral approaches when treating sleep problems in adolescents.

Methods: Participants were 238 adolescents (132 males; 118 with ADHD) ages 15.64-17.99 years and their parents. Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires in May/June 2020 when in-person schools were closed in the United States. Results: Twenty-two percent of families incurred financial costs to support remote learning, and only 59% of school-based services received prior to COVID-19 continued during COVID-19 remote learning. Adolescents with ADHD had fewer routines and more remote learning difficulties than adolescents without ADHD. Parents of adolescents with ADHD had less confidence in managing remote learning and more difficulties in supporting home learning and home-school communication. Thirty-one percent of parents of adolescents with ADHD with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or receiving academic accommodations (504 Plan) reported remote learning to be very challenging, compared to 18% of parents of adolescents with ADHD without an IEP/504 Plan and only 4% of parents of adolescents with neither ADHD nor an IEP/504 Plan. Fewer adolescent routines, higher negative affect, and more difficulty concentrating because of COVID-19 were each associated with greater adolescent remote learning difficulties only in adolescents with ADHD. Conclusions: This study provides initial findings of the nature and impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative for schools and communities to provide the necessary supports to adolescents, particularly those with mental health and/or learning difficulties, and to their parents. Implications and Contributions: The start of the COVID-19 pandemic included the near-universal closing of schools. This study describes the remote learning practices, continuation of school services, financial burden to families, and remote learning difficulties in adolescents with and without ADHD when initial stay-at-home orders were in place in the United States.

        "description":"Since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, more organizations have recognized a need to create more inclusive and antiracist environments. While anti-racism continues to be a highly contested value, for some, it has become an en vogue purpose. How do equity-focused school leaders, who are truly committed to constructing more justice-oriented and truly inclusive environments, distinguish themselves from those who claim to be anti-racist because it is the in thing to do? There are a myriad of relevant responses to that question, but one response that is underdeveloped in the research literature and in the field is the inner life of school leaders. While there has been an increase in attention to socialemotional learning (SEL) for students, and even for teachers, scant attention has been paid to the SEL needs and experiences of school leaders. The purpose of this brief is to address these gaps in a way that supports equity-focused leaders to reflect on their internal life; understand how that internal life intersects with their public equity leadership; and then offer grounding principles for beginning a practice of &quot;Conscious Praxis.&quot;",

        "description":"This study aims to explore the determinants of senior high school (SHS) track preference among grade 10 students in the Philippines using a mixed-method approach. A total of 179 respondents from two private and four public schools in the division of Toledo City were selected through stratified random sampling. The study utilized an online questionnaire to gather quantitative data. The study found that the most significant factors influencing SHS track preference were academic performance, career prospects, personal interests, and parental influence. Students who performed well academically tended to choose the academic track, while those who struggled academically were more likely to choose the technical-vocational-livelihood (TVL) track. Career prospects played a crucial role in students' decision-making, as they were more likely to choose tracks that they believed would lead to better job opportunities. Personal interests and skills also influenced track preferences, with students opting for tracks that aligned with their hobbies and talents. Finally, parental influence played a vital role in students' decision-making, as parents often encouraged their children to pursue specific tracks. The study provides insights into the factors influencing SHS track preference among grade 10 students in the Philippines. The findings suggest that academic performance, career prospects, personal interests, and parental influence are critical factors in students' decision-making. The study's results could inform policy and program development aimed at improving SHS education and helping students make informed decisions about their future education and career paths.",

Traditionally, the Breakthrough model has consisted of two components: (1) a summer enrichment program that provides academic and social-emotional learning support to students; and (2) out-of-school-time tutoring and enrichment during the school year to keep students connected between the summer months. The study focuses on a math-focused, school-year version of Breakthrough's summer program for the 2021-2022 school year. The program was designed to offer high-dosage math tutoring and social-emotional learning opportunities--both incorporating culturally responsive education practices--to 8th-grade students.

        "description":"This study aimed to identify potential gaps related to crisis preparedness at 98 public secondary schools, as such crises may occur following a substantiated eminent threat of school violence. Crisis preparedness data collected by trained external assessors captured knowledge of the procedure for responding in a safety-related crisis and process for notifying school staff, as well as the posting of the crisis plan in school locations. Data were analyzed in conjunction with data on student- and staff-reported school climate, school demographics, and external observations of the school. Analyses indicated that the staff were least aware of the process for &quot;notifying&quot; staff that a crisis was occurring. Middle schools, schools with higher levels of school disorder, and those with poorer reading and math scores were less likely to know the procedure, know the notification process, and have the plans posted in all locations. Schools also need to improve posting of school crisis procedures in shared and open spaces, such as the cafeteria and gymnasium; this is especially critical given that many school shootings occur in these large open spaces. Multilevel analyses indicated that staff perceptions of safety were significantly higher in schools in which the procedure was posted in all locations. Together, these findings provide evidence of a link among crisis planning, school context, and school climate, and complement the need for additional training on what to do following the substantiation of a credible and eminent threat.

        "description":"Math Corps is an evidence-based tutoring program serving students in grades 4 through 8 that increases opportunities to learn and practice fundamental math skills related to understanding whole and rational numbers. Its intent is that all students, in particular students who are Black, Latino, and/or experiencing poverty, will reach grade-level proficiency in math. AmeriCorps tutors are matched with a school and provide support to approximately 24 students, in pairs or groups of three, for 90 minutes each week in 30- to 45-minute, in-person sessions. The success of the program is built on the collective value of three core features: (1) tutors who share backgrounds or lived experiences with the students they serve; (2) personalized tutoring using evidence-based curriculum; and (3) tutor training and coaching. This study aims to provide evidence of the impact of the Math Corps tutoring program on student math achievement through a regression-adjusted matched comparison design, as well as descriptive evidence about program attendance and participants' math confidence, sense of belonging in Math Corps, and student-tutor relationship quality and focus group data. This report is one in a series of six reports on math tutoring programs. The goal of this report series is to inform the tutoring field more broadly and support the provision of high-quality tutoring to as many students in the priority communities as possible.

The rubric uses the term children because, although the children may range in age from preschoolers through students at the end of secondary school, addressing the success gaps is the responsibility of the adult professionals in the district or school, not the children. The rubric is part of the larger &quot;Success Gaps Toolkit: Addressing Equity, Inclusion, and Opportunity,&quot; located on the IDEA Data Center (IDC) website. The rubric contains five content areas. Within each content area, there are two or more indicators. The team will rate each indicator separately. For each indicator, there is a set of probing questions, and the answers to the probing questions provide information the team should consider to help it determine the rating for the indicator. The team has four rating options and rates each indicator as planning, partially implemented, implemented, or exemplary. The rubric provides a description below each rating option.",

The study used a descriptive correlation research design to achieve its objectives, which included determining the profile of Grade 8 students, identifying their learning styles, and examining the relationship between mathematics performance and age, gender, and learning styles. The data was collected through an adapted questionnaire from David Kolb's learning style inventory. The findings revealed no significant relationship between learning styles and academic performance in mathematics. However, it is worth noting that the lack of a significant relationship does not necessarily mean that there is no relationship at all. Motivation, teacher quality, and cultural background may also influence mathematics performance. The findings suggest that educators should consider students' different learning styles when developing effective teaching strategies to enhance mathematics performance among Grade 8 students. This study contributes to the literature on mathematics education and has practical implications for educators seeking to enhance their students' mathematics performance.",

Recognizing that today's students strive to make good use of their time and money, the TransferBOOST initiative worked to ensure that credits transfer and apply seamlessly from a two-year to four-year institution. The third brief in the series shares lessons learned for higher education policymakers and practioners from the TransferBOOST initiative. The 24 institutions that worked to improve equitable transfer student outcomes during the TransferBOOST initiative have helped formulate lessons that other community college and four-year institutions, state partners for higher education, and leaders might use to increase prospective and current student trust in higher education as well as increase enrollment, retention, and completion.

Participants were 288 adolescents (54.9% male participants) with (n = 151) and without (n = 137) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) between the ages of 13 and 15 years (M = 14.09, SD = 0.36). Adolescents reported on social integration and emotional connection (SIEC) to social media and parents reported on their impression of their adolescent's SIEC to social media. Adolescents also reported on cybervictimization experiences and internalizing symptoms. Adolescents with ADHD had higher cybervictimization scores than adolescents without ADHD and were also more likely to report multiple experiences of cybervictimization over the past month. Emotional investment in social media moderated the relations between cybervictimization and internalizing symptoms such that cybervictimization was associated with higher anxiety and depression symptoms at higher levels of emotional investment in social media. Results were consistent across both parent and adolescent report of social integration and emotional connection to social media. These findings indicate that cybervictimization may be associated with negative outcomes specifically among adolescents with a strong emotional connection to their social media use.

Drawing on interviews with the presidents of nine community colleges that are implementing Caring Campus and with four IEBC coaches, this report presents a set of strategies used by the presidents to build a more positive college culture and support reform efforts. The seven strategies are as follows: (1) Communicating the vision of Caring Campus; (2) Modeling the behavioral commitments central to Caring Campus; (3) Aligning new and existing work; (4) Establishing effective human resource practices; (5) Creating relevant structures; (6) Staying in touch with faculty, staff, and the college community; and (7) Celebrating wins. The report unpacks each of these strategies and cites specific examples of their implementation at the nine community colleges. Select reflections from the college presidents are also featured. The report illuminates the role of college presidents in supporting culture-focused reform and offers guidance for leaders at other colleges as they consider how best to initiate and nurture Caring Campus and other culture-focused reforms.",

        "description":"This study investigates the pedagogical competence of elementary school teachers in integrating educational technology in the classroom. Pedagogical competence involves creating effective learning environments, designing activities that cater to different learning styles, and using appropriate teaching strategies. Technology integration in education has opened up new opportunities for interactive learning experiences. The study found that elementary school teachers had a positive attitude towards educational technology, and most reported having high levels of competence in its use. However, the level of pedagogical competence toward educational technology varied significantly among teachers. Hence, the study emphasizes the need for programs and interventions to improve teachers' pedagogical competence in integrating educational technology into their teaching practices. Teachers must identify appropriate technological tools and resources to effectively incorporate educational technology to support their teaching objectives and engage students in meaningful learning experiences. Teachers must also assess students' technical skills and design activities appropriate for their technological competency level. The study recommends that elementary school teachers undergo training to improve their pedagogical competence in using educational technology. Thus, integrating technology into education is crucial in providing high-quality education in the 21st century. Programs are needed to improve teachers' pedagogical competence in incorporating it into their teaching practices.",

        "description":"Students, families, colleges, and lawmakers need clearer information on postsecondary outcomes to make informed decisions. By leveraging data available at institutions and federal agencies, a nationwide student-level data network (SLDN) would close information gaps that persist in our higher education landscape to answer critical questions about students' outcomes. The brief we released today shares lessons learned from a series of conversations with higher education experts aimed at developing a modernized SLDN to ensure stakeholders have the information they need to maximize our collective return on investment in higher education. &quot;Implementing a Student-Level Data Network?(Part IV):?Exploring Design Options&quot; examines high-level conceptual plans for the design and implementation of a federal SLDN developed by three teams of experts. By deliberately engaging experts with a range of perspectives and knowledge, RTI International and IHEP identified potential pain points and solutions related to data submission, data governance, information security, and data usage. Through the considerations presented in the designs and robust discussion at the forum, the authors examined how a well-implemented SLDN could improve data collection and count all students. The brief also highlights ways to reduce the burden on institutions and the National Center for Education Statistics. In our next steps, RTI and IHEP plan to continue to engage experts and gather intelligence, supporting the brainstorming around SLDN design in preparation for future passage of the College Transparency Act or a similar bill creating an SLDN.

A teaching self-efficacy scale was prepared and administered to both groups before the experiment. Participants in the experimental group were trained in vlogging and created a group vlog. For a whole term, they videotaped themselves during Teaching Practice and uploaded the videos to the vlog. They reflected on their teaching performance in the video clips and commented on each others' performance as well. The teaching self-efficacy scale was administered to both groups after the experiment. Statistical analysis revealed a significant improvement in teaching self-efficacy between pretest and posttest for the experimental group while the control group showed no significant improvement. It was recommended that vlogs be used as a method for enhancing EFL teaching self-efficacy.",

The completed thesis and dissertation reports obtained by e-mail during March 2020 were first evaluated using the AI-tool to assess if the manuscript is ready for submission or requires minor or major revision. I have demonstrated how academic research mentors can contextualize and introduce a new e-mentoring approach. The AI-enhanced tool was highly effective in addition to being able to process initial evaluation in an average of 8 minutes per submission, with its special features and accurate enough to determine the accuracy of the language and references of a scientific study.

The study focused on the analysis of the eco-friendly practices of STE implementers based on energy and water conservation practices. This study utilized the descriptive-survey design of research. It involved a total number of thirty-six STE teachers, eighty-four YES-O officers, and the sixty SSG officers among STE implementers. The instrument was subjected to a reliability test. The study concluded that there was no significant variation in the assessment of the participants on energy and water conservation.

          "Bueno, David Cababaro"],
        "description":"Superintendency is regarded as one of the most visible and powerful leadership roles in the world of education today (Sovine, 2000). This research was conducted to identify the challenges faced by assistant superintendents and their perspectives in terms of preparation and support. The study made use of the qualitative research design and was conducted in Region III, Philippines with 10 participants. Findings showed that assistant superintendents faced issues and challenges in terms of organizational and job-related mandates and have negative perspectives about the preparation and support extended to them. During the day-to-day operations in their respective divisions, assistant superintendents face governance and culture-related problems in terms of procurement, handling administrative cases and managing personnel-related actions. On the other hand, during the epidemic, public school superintendents faced several hurdles due to the complexities and challenges of education reforms at both the national and local levels. The school systems are undergoing continuous reforms and redirections as they transition from distance learning to limited face-to-face instructions. Additional obstacles have arisen because of increased public pressure for higher student performance in the face of the pandemic, causing problems throughout the educational system. As educational leaders, the Assistant Superintendents have a lot of work to accomplish to fulfill their duties. Furthermore, in the new normal, there is a leadership crisis due to teacher shortages, insufficient school finance, a lack of school facilities and resources to manage distance education, and excessive time demands. These complicated elements have added to the difficulties that assistant superintendents have in meeting the demands of their jobs. Finally, the critical requirement for skills and competencies to deliver efficiently and effectively has caused them stress, prompting them to seek personal and professional help by whatever means available. Based on the findings and analysis generated, this study recommends several pre-service activities, programs, and projects relevant to superintendency preparation and support. Conduct of immersion programs to prepare aspiring superintendents; coaching and mentoring of skills and competencies relevant to the functions of the job; attend graduate school; participate in exchange study programs; undergo induction program provided by DepEd; and intense preparation on legal and moral aspects of the leadership role.",

        "author":["Bueno, David Cababaro"],
        "description":"Innovation and the development of knowledge in the field of scientific research is increasing exponentially, but it continues to be disjointed. It makes it difficult to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research and dissemination, as well as to evaluate empirical evidence in the area of academic excellence. Recent literature reviews are frequently lacking in thoroughness and rigor and are carried out in part rather than using a specific design. This descriptive-mapping review aimed to illustrate plagiarism and research integrity literature published over a 10-year period (2010 to 2020). To achieve this goal, literature reviews were conducted to obtain relevant articles and documentation on plagiarism and its potential impact in the academic and publishing industries. Methodical searches in specific databases such as Web of Science and Scopus, including the Google Scholar Search Engine, have been undertaken to ensure the accuracy of the results. Thereafter, descriptive mapping was used to categorize qualifying articles. Over 350 titles were collected from the searches, of which 129 complete works were published in various journals during the covered period. Finally, in this review, 35 papers were eligible for inclusion. The themes were enumerated in the scholarly articles. Findings revealed a dearth of scientifically credible and relevant literature on plagiarism issues, such as the phenomenon in the academic environment, its particular specific factors and triggering causes, and the impacts of the institutional policy interventions being enforced. Although the results provided background information for the creation of a realistic guide to avoid plagiarism incidences, robust empirical and evaluative studies should be planned to identify the real implications of preventing plagiarism to uphold the credibility of scientific research and evaluate the impact of ethical issues, practices, and policies suggested by organizations and industries.",

It utilized descriptive cross-sectional design of research with the standardized instrument to measure the perceptions of the two groups of respondents on the supervisory practices within the specified time frame. The perceived supervisory practices in relations to the identified areas were analyzed per group of teacher using Weighted Mean and the comparative analysis on the level of agreement regarding the perceptions of the two groups of teachers, independent t-Test was used. Both the group of teachers registered the same level of agreement on the various aspects of supervisory practices. There was no significant difference between the perceptions of ST and NST on the supervisory practices in an autonomous national high school.",

This study focused on the Master Teachers' (MTs) skills and attitudes towards research as basis for research capability building program for MTs in the Schools Division of Zambales. The study used the descriptive-survey design. The data gathered were organized and processed through the SPSS. Majority of the MTs were middle aged, female and married, earned MA/MS units, and have served as Master Teacher I for 1-4 years. A very small percentage of the MTs have attended research-related trainings or conferences and undertaken, published or presented researches. They have average skills in searching, using and evaluating information including their awareness on the various sources of information and where to obtain them. They have fair skills in designing experimental study as well as selecting and developing research instruments, choosing appropriate statistical tools and preparing manuscript for publication. They strongly value training in educational research but moderately apply research findings to real life context. They have high regards relative to the value of doing research to become better educator. Time, efforts and resources in learning about research findings were essential elements to create positive attitudes towards research. A research capability training program is hereby proposed as the output of the study. The program consists of various levels from lectures, hands-on workshop, and writing research articles for colloquium and for possible publication.",

This report provides insight into the academic readiness of Minnesota public high school graduates. Developmental education courses add to the overall cost of college for students in terms of both tuition and opportunity costs for students who spend additional time finishing developmental course requirements before starting program-specific courses. &quot;Getting Prepared 2021&quot; fulfills the legislative mandate (Minnesota Statute 13.32, subdivisions 3 and 6) to provide summary information about Minnesota public high school graduates who enrolled in developmental courses at Minnesota postsecondary institutions within two years of high school graduation. The report utilizes analysis resulting from linking student level data within the Minnesota Statewide Longitudinal Education Data System (SLEDS) on Minnesota public high school graduates from the Minnesota Department of Education with college enrollment data from the Minnesota Office of Higher Education and the National Student Clearinghouse.

        "description":"The &quot;Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions&quot; (BDS) movement against Israel is one of the faces of anti-Semitism in the United States. It threatens not only Jewish students and scholars but also the political neutrality of the university. The BDS movement is particularly concentrated in higher education and creates an environment of academic politicization to the detriment of academic freedom, freedom of speech, and constructive civil discourse. This report finds that the BDS movement's success on campus is mixed, while its broader movement is well-funded and growing in influence. This report expands beyond previous work on the BDS movement by examining its constitutive student groups in the context of its off-campus support organizations and funding. BDS in universities must be understood as one component of a larger left-wing social justice movement that politicizes higher education. This report first describes the Palestinian origins and development of the campus BDS movement, before examining its rates of success and failure nationwide from 2005 to the Fall 2022 semester. Three campus case studies then examine how pro-BDS initiatives are propagated, how such anti-Israel measures affect anti-Semitism on campus, and how university administrations address the issue. The second half of this report examines the off-campus organizations that enable BDS student activism by means of training, legal assistance, and funding. This report also notes ties between BDS organizations and terrorism.",

Thus, this study traces the employability and productivity of a Private Higher Education Institution's (PHEI's) Graduate School graduates from 2010-2015 regarding employment status, position in the present job, and gross monthly income in the present job. The school-related factors relevant to graduate's employability and the competencies/ skills/ and values learned in the graduate school are important factors considered to further improve the curricular offerings. The descriptive-survey is used. Majority of the Ed. D., MA, MBA and MPM graduates are employed in a regular or permanent status. Thus, the Graduate School is continuously nurturing and embracing the quality of education as revealed by the graduates. They are occupying supervisory and managerial job level positions. Education graduates are school supervisors and head teachers, while the MBA and MPM graduates are supervisors and executives. The graduate programs are responding to the needs of various industries. Ed.D. graduates are highly satisfied with basic salary; the MA and MBA graduates were receiving at least Php30,000; and at least Php25,000 a month for the MPM graduates. Administration and governance, curriculum and instruction, research, professional and cognate courses, student services, library, internet laboratory, interdisciplinary learning, and teaching/ learning environment are the school-related factors relevant to their current employment. Communication, human relations, entrepreneurial, information technology, problem-solving, critical thinking, and research skills are considered relevant skills learned at the graduate school. Love of God, honesty, punctuality, obedience to superior, perseverance, creativity, professional integrity, unity, fairness, love for other, nationalism and eco-friendly are the values evidently manifested in their workplaces as part of the hidden curriculum of the institution.",

The study determines the current Work Life Balance (WLB) practices and policies as a basis for institutional policy reformulation in a Private Higher Education Institution (PHEI). Specifically, the study seeks to describe the work-life related activities of employees; impacts of work-life balance related activities; and the related policies of the institution in terms of leave arrangements, parenting and pregnancy, work arrangements, additional work provisions, and experience in the organization. The researchers utilized the descriptive cross sectional design of research to obtain information concerning the analysis of the work-life balance of employees using survey questionnaire at a given time in an academic year. The participants of the study were the school administrators and faculty members in one private higher education institution in the Philippines with full-time status during the Academic Year 2015-2016. The survey- questionnaire for work-life balance (WBL) was modified from &quot;Better Work Life Balance Survey- Employees&quot; of the University of Queensland. Spreadsheet software was used for more efficient, effective and accurate treatment of data. The work-life balance related activities of employees are sometimes at risk. Work-life related policies are viewed by the employees in various ways. Leave arrangements are being viewed by employees in various ways in the organization. Moreover, parenting and pregnancy related policies are also evident in the organization. Furthermore, various work arrangements related policies are also enjoyed by the employees. Additional provisions regarding work are also evident. There is a moderate impact work related activities and policies on the personal life of employees.",

Affordability matters a great deal for transfer students, but it has typically not been understood or prioritized. The IHEP and HCM teams joined forces with rpk GROUP to offer technical assistance to TransferBOOST institutions and state partners to make strategic finance and college affordability a signature feature of the initiative. The second brief in the series outlines the steps partnerships took and offers guidance on how institutions can use the Transfer Affordability Financial Tool. It also provides clear steps for how states can support institutions in improving transfer affordability. [This report was written with contributions from Katie Hagan.

The primary target audience for these recommendations is State Education Agency (SEA) assessment leaders and others at the state-and national level who are responsible for ensuring that braille readers are full participants in their state assessment, whether general or alternate. Most desirable is that these recommendations will initiate conversations between and among states, districts, braille service providers, and test developers.",

Done well, authorizing increases student achievement by expanding the supply of quality public schools. Because authorizing is a continually developing profession, these professional standards must likewise evolve in response to the growth and complexity of the ever-growing charter school sector. &quot;Principles &amp; Standards for Quality Charter School Authorizing&quot; derives from the National Association of Charter School Authorizers' (NACSA's) vast experience, research, and work with authorizers across the nation. Accordingly, NACSA revisits and updates them regularly to address current challenges and reflect the latest lessons drawn from practice, research, and analysis. These &quot;Principles &amp; Standards&quot; begin with three clearly stated Core Principles, followed by more detailed Standards and accompanying practical guidance that authorizers often seek. The Core Principles are broad, bedrock values that authorizers should uphold consistently throughout their pursuit and implementation of the Standards. The Standards are presented in five sections, each of which is introduced by a brief statement that summarizes the scope of the Standards that follow. Most of the Standards are &quot;essential standards,&quot; meaning that authorizers at every stage of development should place priority on following them.

This report compiles and examines the university's DEI plans, its progress updates, and all of the publicly accessible DEI plans and updates published by the university's various colleges and schools. Key takeaways from the report are that UT Austin's DEI initiatives espouse a clear ideological agenda, call for a vast overhaul of curriculum and instruction, make an overt commitment to make DEI an effective job requirement for faculty, and create and feed a large bureaucracy devoted to advancing the vague goals of DEI.",

This study seeks to identify the factors that support the strategies of Islamic Education teachers in akhlaq (character) building among students in an Islamic Private Secondary School. The research applied qualitative design with in-depth semi-structured interviews; the data were gathered from five Islamic education teachers to explore the supporting factors of teacher strategies of Islamic education and ensure the strengths and weaknesses of these factors. The teachers were purposively selected based on their experiences in teaching and learning. Moreover, the study revealed that the results identified the main supporting factor in the implementing of teacher strategies in Islamic education in akhlaq building among students was the school discipline, co-curricular activities of Islamic school, student (diversity in learning), and teachers as a role model as well as parental involvement in akhlaq building. The finding also asserted that the social environment is one of the supporting factors in implementing teacher strategies of Islamic education in akhlaq building among students. Based on the findings, the researcher recommends the future study, including examining other participants of the school, namely students, staff, principal of school, and parents, to enrich data from different views.",

These recent arguments stem from earlier scholars who claimed that the context of education is often taken for granted, although its influence on teaching and learning is crucial. Perhaps the main reason the context of learning is often ignored is that it has been defined vaguely over the years. Educational context is less understood because it comprises many aspects, including culture, history, social factors, and national ethos, influencing people's perceptions and understanding. The relationship between context and education outcome remains unclear due to the lack of a clear definition. Since context plays a vital role in influencing education outcomes, ambitious policies on educational reforms must consider the context of learning to be implemented successfully.",

Total of 425 responses of students who attend online classes during lockdown from Phuentsholing Higher Secondary, Phuentsholing Middle Secondary, Sonamgang Middle Secondary Schools, and College of Science and Technology in Phuentsholing, Bhutan. The result indicates that socio-economic, technological, and psychological situations hinder effective online teaching and learning. Household chores, large family members, data packages, and poor internet connectivity are other difficulties students face making online education ineffective. Some of the measures to support economically disadvantaged students and provide personal computers/laptops to teachers for preparing and developing teaching-learning materials are suggested. Other recommendations and viable measures based on surveys are suggested to overcome such challenges for students and support providers to make online education effective and focused.",

EPUB is a widely adopted format for many digital books and is specifically designed to display text, audio, images and, in some cases, video in a manner usable by all learners, especially those with sensory, physical and learning disabilities including those who use assistive technology (AT). For these students, the ability to personalize the format of learning materials is essential; and for all students, EPUB simply provides more options: it can be more accessible, in more ways, than any other format. EPUB has been fully embraced by higher education publishers, and K-12 publishers are now starting to modify their publishing workflows to create EPUB content. Users of this guide will learn how apps (reading systems) can personalize the reading experience, which benefits everybody. It also details how students with reading difficulties can benefit from the rich range of accessibility features built into the EPUB format and into apps. Teachers and curriculum development professionals will learn how to use common word processing software to create their own fully accessible materials as EPUBs.

Preliminarily, the open-ended questionnaire collected from conveniently sampled 39 participants was administered to reach students' metacognitive awareness of listening skill. The initial analysis induced the researcher to employ podcasts as an extensive listening activity by having 4 voluntary students fill up reflective listening journals for each podcast with the aim of realizing the effect of extensive listening on learners' metacognition. Lastly, the focus group interview was conducted to solicit students' possible changing metacognitive views about listening skill in general and extensive listening in particular. As a result, students instructed on listening through the traditional way did not practice their listening outside the class. The dominant factors affecting listening comprehension respectively comprise scanty listening practice, unknown lexis, and unfamiliar background knowledge. The dominant strategies were identified as listening multiple times, raising concentration, taking notes, and looking up into dictionary. The participants also designated favourable metacognitive awareness towards the study per se, extensive listening, and general listening skill.",

The specific measures of cooperating teacher effectiveness considered in this prior literature (value added and performance evaluations), however, are infrequently observable to individuals responsible for student teaching placements. In this paper, we consider a more easily observed proxy for mentor effectiveness: National Board (NB) Certification. We find that NB teachers are considerably more likely to host candidates than other teachers, candidates supervised by NB teachers are slightly more likely to be hired within three years, and these candidates have slightly lower value added in English language arts than their peers, all else being equal. We find no significant relationship between cooperating teacher NB certification and candidates' later attrition and value added in math. We conclude that individuals and policies seeking to leverage student teaching placements to improve student and teacher outcomes may need to focus on less easily observable proxies of cooperating teacher quality than NB certification status.",

This article addresses these concerns by presenting the methodological foundations for a replication science. It provides an introduction to the Causal Replication Framework, which defines &quot;replication&quot; as a research design that tests whether two (or more) studies produce the same causal effect within the limits of sampling error. The framework formalizes the conditions under which replication success can be expected, and allows for the causal interpretation of replication failures. Through two applied examples, the article demonstrates how the Causal Replication Framework may be utilized to plan prospective replication designs, as well as to interpret results from existing replication efforts.

        "description":"Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic era, concerns about teacher turnover and teacher shortages remain at the top of the education agenda. But contrary to media reports about a &quot;wave of resignations and retirements&quot; (e.g., Heller, 2021), early evidence from state databases showed a more nuanced picture: teacher attrition was actually down during the pandemic's first year (teachers leaving after the 2019-2020 school year) before it increased somewhat in the next year (e.g., Bacher-Hicks et al., 2021, 2022; Bastian &amp; Fuller, 2023; Camp et al., 2022; CERRA, 2022; Goldhaber &amp; Theobald, 2022a,b). In this policy brief, we follow-up and expand on our earlier analyses of teacher mobility and attrition in Washington state with an additional year of data from the 2022-23 school year. We draw on a longitudinal database of school staffing in Washington, the S-275, which now provides 39 years of annual data on teachers and other school employees in the state.",

        "description":"While there is overwhelming evidence of the positive impact of culturally responsive and equitable practices for adult learners and students of color, there is a remaining lack of infrastructural and institutional support for culturally sustaining work. Much anti-racist work has relied on individual dedication, grant-specific funding, and short-term programs. Standalone projects can have significant positive impact on those who participate and help individual students reach their personal and professional goals. However, anti-racist work has the most potential for influencing systemic change in community college structures in which inequity and exclusion are embedded and reproduced (Wilson, 2021). Community colleges need sustainable equitable infrastructure that dismantles embedded inequities and is supported by an institutional mandate that addresses the specific needs of Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) adult learners. This brief covers what infrastructure community colleges in New York have to support BIPOC adult learners, as well as the best practices for anti-racist and equity-supporting infrastructure. The authors conclude with three specific strategies for such an infrastructure.",

        "description":"Proposed by Ivan Illich in the 1970s, the deschooling society was one of the most contentious and radical thoughts in education in terms of its critics against compulsory education around the globe and proposals in the name of networks in which everyone in need of learning and teaching can participate to learn and teach anywhere and anytime without any prescriptions or proscriptions. With the advent of the internet and technology, the paradigmatic change towards post-method pedagogy in education and ELT, and the constricting current pandemic state, we have been much closer than ever to the actualization of deschooling society. This work, as a caveat, was not solely formed to deliver brief information about the contents of the book but rather also to reassess, renew, and readapt the deschooling concept of the 1970s into the 21st-century digital era at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic with the implications of a post-modern understanding of ELT. The issue discussed in the present paper is in general about the way of formal compulsory education through schooling, yet in specific the implications of deschooling on ELT in the current chaotic state of the world. Therefore, a brief reappraisal of the book was preliminarily outlined, and later its connections with ELT within the framework of post-method pedagogy were explicated in the revival part.",

Its objectives are to determine how physics teachers describe computer simulations based on how they are used, how these are embedded in the teaching-learning process, their impact on the teaching-learning process, and the challenges of integrating these into physics teaching. Using the phenomenological design, two themes emerged for the first objectives, which are process-based and system-based. First, the teacher-manipulated with sub-themes of engaging, demonstrating, elaborating, and evaluating, and student-manipulated emerged on how the simulations are used. Second, the impact to teaching generated knowledge-based, skill-based, and value-based learning-based primarily on the three learning domains. Also, respondents emphasized that the integrations of computer simulations are convenience, efficacy, and heterogeneity. Finally, the challenges in the integration process are classified as teacher and school-related. The results showed that teachers are integrating computer simulations differently depending on their resources and the TPACK knowledge.",

This study is focused on semester four students undergoing industrial training. This study was conducted on 158 respondents from various organizations. Using the important relative index (RII), the level of important factors was ranked through the value of the index. Findings show the highest employer satisfaction is towards the student mastering their knowledge, adhering to the working hours, improving their skills and knowledge, and communicating well with co-workers. Besides, it also shows a good correlation between knowledge and personality among industrial training students. This study found that industrial training students of the Civil Engineering Diploma Program had a good level of control over all four domains. Overall findings showed that employers are satisfied with the industrial training students of the UiTM Pahang Civil Engineering Diploma Program. This study is important to measure the effectiveness of the industrial training syllabus in terms of achieving the program outcomes addressed in the syllabus.",

        "description":"The main objective of this study is to identify the constraint hindering ICT integration in Ethiopian public secondary schools. The study's results demonstrate that the Integration of ICT is still in its infant stages due to a lack of infrastructure, insufficient funds, lack of technical and administrative support, lack of time, teachers' knowledge, abilities, and use of technology are lacking. Those challenges are distinguished as teachers-related challenges, students-related challenges, resource-related challenges and administrative-related challenges. The implication is that using ICT integration to improve learning and teaching is not happening in accordance with the national ICT policy strategy, thus reaping the greatest benefit from ICT integration all concerned bodies, and actors at all levels should pay special attention to ICT integration practices in the study area from the higher-level ministry of education to the lower-level woreda education office and schools. Finally, it is suggested that in the future a countrywide study involving all other variables and private secondary schools not considered in this study should be conducted.",

As part of a 2016 grant awarded to Uncommon from the U.S. Department of Education's Charter Schools Program to support replication and expansion of its school model, we conducted a rigorous external evaluation of the network's effects on student outcomes and the key practices implemented in schools that are part of it. The study aimed to address gaps in the existing evidence base for Uncommon's impacts, focusing on the network's two largest regions. We used a rigorous propensity score matching approach to examine the impacts of Uncommon middle schools in Newark and a lottery-based experimental approach to examine the impacts of Uncommon middle schools in NYC. We found that Uncommon produced substantial positive effects on student achievement in math and English language arts in Newark and no discernable effects on student achievement in NYC.",

Paraeducators are more racially and ethnically diverse than special education teachers, particularly in the last decade, and tend to be less experienced. They also have full-time salaries that are about half of the average special education teacher salary. Paraeducator-to-student ratios have decreased over time in the state, but they are higher in schools serving more students of color. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, paraeducator attrition rates from the state's public school workforce have increased dramatically over time; for example, the paraeducator attrition rate after the 2021-22 school year (23%) was over twice as high as the attrition rate after the 2008-09 school year (8%). These findings have implications for how policymakers and school leaders should approach decision-making related to the paraeducator workforce, as well as how researchers might approach further research with this group of educators.",

Claiming the purpose of their rating systems is to help families navigate increasingly complex school choice options, these organizations present their ratings as authoritative sources of information. In the growing evidence base about consumer-oriented systems, there is consistent research showing that the measures that comprise school ratings are associated with schools' demographic characteristics, such as students' race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.

Increasingly, parents, particularly Black parents, are taking out Parent PLUS (Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students) loans and putting off retirement to help their children pay for college. This brief highlights the struggles of Black parents who assume Parent PLUS loans on behalf of their children. This brief is the fourth brief in a series based on qualitative data from the National Black Student Debt Study, which includes a survey of nearly 1,300 Black borrowers and in-depth interviews with 100 borrowers. The brief combines data and quotes from the study with federal data. In recognition of the needs of Black borrowers, The Education Trust is encouraging Congress and the Biden administration to address the root cause of the student debt crisis by making college more affordable by doubling the Pell Grant and creating a federal-state partnership to make public two- and four-year colleges debt free. The Education Trust is also urging the Biden administration to cancel at least $50,000 in federal education debt and make Parent PLUS loans eligible for the proposed new income-driven repayment plan.

        "description":"The Tuition Opportunity Program for Students (subsequently renamed the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, also known as TOPS) was created by Act 1375 of the 1997 Regular Legislative Session. The first college freshman class to receive TOPS awards entered postsecondary education in the fall of 1998. Act 1202 of the 2001 Regular Legislative Session requires the Louisiana Board of Regents (BoR) to prepare a report analyzing various aspects of the TOPS program. Act 227 of the 2015 Regular Legislative Session modified prior law to clarify and specify data points without making any substantive changes to the program. In accordance with Act 227, this report includes: (1) An analysis of the relationship between high school courses taken and the student's score on the American College Test (ACT); (2) The number of high school graduates who are eligible for TOPS and subsequently enroll in college; (3) Persistence (retention) rates of TOPS recipients; (4) The number of and reasons for students losing award eligibility; (5) Graduation data; and (6) TOPS time-to-degree and degree attainment information. Act 587 of the 2014 Regular Legislative Session added new reporting requirements to the TOPS report, including: (1) Demographic information of program award recipients (race, gender, parents' income); (2) High school GPA and ACT scores of program award recipients grouped by mean; and (3) Average high school GPA and average ACT scores of students who lost the award. Act 227 requires that this report be submitted annually to the Senate Committee on Education and the House Committee on Education by December 1. The report includes current and historical data on TOPS students (students receiving an Opportunity, Performance, or Honors Award) and, where appropriate non-TOPS students to allow for comparison. Overall, the findings indicated that: (1) From 2011-2012 to 2020-2021, 86.0% of students deemed eligible for a TOPS award accepted the award by enrolling in a postsecondary education institution in Louisiana; (2) The average ACT score of all TOPS recipients between 2012 and 2022 was 24, and the average high school GPA (Core GPA) was 3.47; (3) From 2011-2012 to 2020-2021, the majority of TOPS recipients were disproportionately white (73.9%) and disproportionately female (56.9%); (4) Students who begin college with a TOPS award persist and graduate at a higher rate than non-TOPS students; (5) The average time-to-degree for TOPS recipients pursuing an associate's degree is 3.6 years, compared with 5.7 years for non-TOPS; and (6) The average time-to-degree for TOPS recipients pursuing a baccalaureate degree is 4.4 years, compared with 5.1 years for non-TOPS.

As one might expect in a nation as diverse as the United States--with respect to economics, geography, and politics--the level of commitment to education varies on a state-by-state basis. Thus, NEA Research offers this report to its state and local affiliates as well as to researchers, policymakers, and the public as a tool to examine public education programs and services. Part I of this report--Rankings 2022--provides state-level data on an array of topics relevant to the complex enterprise of public education. Part II of this report--Estimates 2023--is in its 78th year of production. Estimates provides data tables projecting public school enrollment, employment and compensation of personnel, and finances, as reported by individual state departments of education. The influx of federal funding through COVID relief measures added a new layer of complexity to the development of financial projections. Part III of this report--National Trends 2014-23--presents summary data of national trends in student enrollment and attendance, staff salaries, sources of school funding, and levels of educational expenditures in the previous 10 years.

        "description":"Among programs designed to reduce teen pregnancy, few evidence-based interventions specifically aim to reduce repeat pregnancies. Repeat pregnancies among adolescent mothers, however, are both prevalent and consequential. About one-sixth of births to adolescent mothers are repeat births. Compared to adolescent mothers with only one child, those with more than one face increased health risks and greater long-term difficulties related to educational and economic outcomes. Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy (TOPP) is an 18-month multicomponent program to delay repeat teen pregnancy among adolescent mothers. Developed by staff from the OhioHealth hospital system and Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, TOPP features personalized contraceptive counseling by nurses trained in motivational interviewing (MI), along with access to a contraceptive clinic and transportation and social worker assistance. Beginning in 2011, Mathematica collaborated with staff from OhioHealth and the Nationwide Children's Hospital to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of TOPP with 598 adolescent mothers with low incomes. Based on follow-up surveys conducted 6 and 18 months after study enrollment, as well as state birth records collected for up to 30 months after enrollment, this initial RCT found that TOPP significantly reduced the chances of study participants having a repeat pregnancy or subsequent birth, and increased their chances of using long-acting reversible contraception. This present study builds on these results by examining the longer-term impacts of TOPP on participants' educational outcomes. As mentioned above, repeat births among adolescent mothers are linked to greater difficulties in attending or completing school, which might hinder their ability to achieve economic self-sufficiency later in life. This study examines whether TOPP impacted mothers' enrollment and persistence in postsecondary education over a period of up to eight years after starting the program, using college enrollment data from the National Student Clearinghouse.",

Equity in higher education can be accomplished by meeting the needs of marginalized and minoritized populations, particularly BIPOC students. As well, the North Carolina economy can increase its GDP by positively impacting the racial wealth gap. North Carolina Community Colleges as presented in this brief generated $35.3 billion in social benefits in 2019-20, including $23.8 billion in added student income, $8.7 billion in added business income, $2.1 billion in added income from the colleges' activities, and $633.9 million in social savings.

The report also features national eight-year completion outcomes for the fall 2013 and fall 2014 cohorts through June 2021 and June 2022 respectively. The national completion rate measures the performance of the entire higher education system. It counts all students who enter postsecondary education for the first time each fall, enrolling full-time or part-time at two-year or four-year institutions, and completing at any U.S. degree-granting institution. It includes those who complete after transfer, not just completions at the starting institution. Thus, the results more fully capture today's students' success, which increasingly involve mobility across institutions, re-entry after stop-out, and changes in enrollment intensities. A longitudinal data dashboard accompanies this report and offers detailed six-year and eight-year completion outcomes by cohort year across starting institution sectors and student backgrounds, enabling national and state-level comparisons through interactive visualizations and analysis tools.

        "description":"The Yearly Success and Progress Rates report goes beyond traditional student outcome measures by showing year-by-year rates of retention, persistence, transfer, completion and stop-out. It is designed to help institutions and states better identify and inform effective intervention points to increase student success. This report examines yearly academic progress for approximately 2.3 million individuals who began college for the first time in fall 2015 with the intent to earn a credential. Their yearly progress and success rates can be compared among 50 states and Washington D.C. through interactive data dashboards available on the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center's website. Academic progress is measured in each subsequent academic year for six years after entry. The report shows the highest level of academic progress made, broken out by the type of starting institution and enrollment intensity at entry (full-time vs. part-time). Results do not account for enrollment status changes after entry. The outcome categories are modeled after those used in the Student Achievement Measure (SAM), and can be used as the most current national and state benchmarks for institutions participating in SAM. Unlike in SAM reporting, undergraduate certificates are counted as completions in this report. A recent data reporting change occurred that improved student-level data matching in the Clearinghouse database. As a result, the outcomes of the fall 2015 beginning postsecondary student cohort are the primary emphasis of the report this year. There may be some trend discontinuities from the previous editions.

Improving access and completion using strategies that attempt to support all students--regardless of demographic background--may yield important progress. There are significant and longstanding racial disparities across student populations with respect to college access and completion in Washington. Alongside these racial disparities are disparities in access and completion for other underserved populations, including: adult learners, foster youth, incarcerated and previously incarcerated individuals, low-income students, LGBTQ students, undocumented or DACA students, and veteran learners. This research brief chronicles high-level evidence of inequitable access and attainment in Washington higher education and identifies potential state-level efforts to advance equitable outcomes for students from historically excluded and underserved populations. The authors complement this scan of state strategies with a distillation of the state- or system-supported initiatives that existing evidence suggests can contribute to widescale improvements in equitable access and attainment.",

The framework organizes the policy work into four areas deemed essential to achieve the 70 percent goal: (1) Affordability; (2) Enrollment; (3) Completion; and (4) Student Supports. The framework is an expression of the belief that if an affordable and supportive educational environment is built, more Washingtonians will enroll in programs and complete credentials. Ensuring equitable access and success for all students is central to the strategic framework. This Strategic Action Plan (SAP) is built on the educational attainment goal and the strategic framework that organizes the work to increase the likelihood of achieving our goal. This SAP includes a summary of the current state policy environment and a work plan for the Council, partners, and stakeholders to take on over a two-year cycle.

        "description":"The decision to close schools in March 2020 was a massive disruption to public education. But pandemic-related closures did more than put in-person instruction on hold. School closures also meant that teacher candidates could not complete their student teaching experiences. Three years later, the negative consequences of school closures for students are well known: learning declined and pre-existing inequities grew. But how (if at all) changes to licensure requirements affected teachers and students is less clear. To provide an initial picture of what happened, this research brief describes the nature of pandemic-era licensure modifications, how many teachers they might have affected, and why we should care. The rough estimate suggests that around 100,000 graduates of traditional preparation programs might have entered the profession under changed licensure rules in 2020-2021. Most of these teachers likely would have entered the teacher workforce, regardless of the changes to licensure rules. Still, under normal circumstances, some of them might have failed their licensure test or balked at the costs of entering the profession; virtually all of them would, absent the changes, have completed student teaching before being hired.",

        "description":"Washington has made some strides in recent years toward increasing awareness and state support of students' basic needs but has lacked state and regional information to drive larger-scale policies, programs, and investments to address the attainment barriers associated with basic needs insecurity. State and regional data on unmet basic needs can help Washington more effectively tackle basic needs barriers to postsecondary attainment by: (1) increasing awareness of the true scale of basic needs insecurity, particularly in communities and education sectors where it may be &quot;invisible&quot; or counter to popular perception; (2) pointing to disparate impacts in particular student populations through the lenses of student status, race/ethnicity, veteran, or employment status, etc.; and (3) serving as an advocacy tool for data-driven solutions on campus, regional, and state levels. To address this information gap, in 2021 a statewide Basic Needs Data Work Group proposed a coordinated basic needs survey across Washington higher education institutions. The Washington Student Experience survey reported on here identified considerable levels of basic needs insecurity among college students across the state. In addition, the survey highlighted significant disparities for certain student groups, especially American Indian/Alaska Native students, Black/African-American students, low-income students, students with disability, students with dependents, and former foster youth.

KIPP administers three school leadership programs examined in this evaluation: (1) the Successor Prep program, which prepares new principals to lead existing schools; (2) the Fisher Fellowship program, which prepares new principals to lead new KIPP schools; and (3) the KIPP Leadership Design Fellowship (KLDF) program, which disseminates effective school leadership development strategies outside of KIPP. In addition to supporting KIPP to improve the design of the KIPP school leadership programs, the evaluation findings can guide the replication of effective tools and strategies that increase the number of highly effective principals among other charter and traditional public schools as well as across the principal preparation field. To understand how KIPP school leadership programs support the development of effective school leaders, this evaluation (1) conducted a descriptive analysis of results from surveys that we designed and administered to former program participants, (2) compared outcomes for teachers and students in schools that received Successor Prep principals to those for other similar KIPP schools in a comparison group, and (3) examined properties of the instrument KIPP uses to select participants for the Fisher Fellowship program, including its reliability.",

        "description":"While the world is experiencing a severe global crisis for the COVID-19 pandemic, the academic education sectors of several developing countries face formidable challenges, including Bangladesh. The current study aimed at finding out the barriers and possibilities for blended learning in the new normal situation in the education sector of Bangladesh. The researcher followed a descriptive approach with reviews of related literature and conducted Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with twenty-one university teachers to collect data and develop the study. The study found some challenges for blended education, e.g., poverty, lack of familial and institutional support, inadequate internet facilities, untrained teachers for using technological gadgets, electricity issues in rural and coastal areas. Still, the study found prospects to deploy blended learning and flipped classrooms in the post-pandemic period because of the countenance of 71.43% of participants. Finally, the study recommended some possible strategies in the new normal life for a more balanced educational system, particularly at the tertiary level.",

        "description":"The paradigm shift from traditional didactic instruction to technology-enriched teaching and learning environments significantly benefits learners. Educational technology can visualize abstract mathematical concepts contextually and graphically and allow learners to actively construct this knowledge. This study aims to ascertain the efficacy of a computer-assisted instruction method using GeoGebra in further developing the concept of the function limit for grade XI students. This study employed a quasi-experiment static-group comparison design with 60 students from Gongzim Ugyen Dorji Central School at Haa in Bhutan. The students were divided into two equal groups. Group 'A' used the GeoGebra software, while group 'B' used the conventional method to learn the limit of the function. The data was collected through a Conceptual Knowledge Test of Limit Function. In addition, an independent sample t-test was employed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 22.0). This study demonstrated that students who were taught using GeoGebra outperformed those who learned through conventional methods. The results confirmed that GeoGebra software could enhance and significantly improve students' conceptual understanding of the limit of the function.",

The self-determination theory model and contextual approach to e-learning delivery (learning flexibility, online learning, study management, technology, modular learning, and online interaction) were used as theoretical underpinnings. Data collected using electronic surveys and information from semi-structured interviews were analyzed. The application of a descriptive survey confirms the low level of readiness among students. When compared across the population, the results provided no significant difference in the level of readiness among students when grouped according to sex and provided significant difference according to year level and Course. Interpreting the results together with qualitative analysis parallels the notion of difficulties among students in all dimensions of flexible learning. This research places the thrust of improving curriculum delivery by addressing flexible learning policies in the local context.",

A quantitative method was used to define the study's objective, where two sections of Psychology students who took up Science 101 and Science 104 were chosen as respondents to answer the survey questionnaire through google forms. The purposive sampling technique was also employed since these students can appropriately answer the queries sent to them. The Likert scale method was used to measure the students' level of agreement, with the 5-point range, where the results were collated and analyzed. The research result finds several strategic activities such as report enhancement, online debates, virtual experiments, discussion and updating of recent findings, and the creation of infomercials that truly captured their interest and attention. This study made use of several references and tables in order to support the results obtained. The researcher recommends that there should be effective and efficient motivational activities to sustain student engagement.

Under federal law, states must also enact their own laws that require local education agencies(LEAs) to expel students for firearm offenses for a period of no less than 1 year. State education agencies (SEAs) must submit data to the secretary of education on an annual basis, reporting the number of students who were expelled for firearm offenses under the law during the 12-monthreporting period. The report describes the GFSA review process and results and includes a summary of how the quality of data submissions improved as the result of the data review and feedback process with states. The report also summarizes compliance with GFSA reporting mandates and data on firearm incidents for SY 2019-20 and includes detail about the number of incidents reported by student grade level, weapon type, and disciplinary action resulting from violations of the law. The report also presents comparisons to incident counts and rates from prior school years to explore changes in incident rates across time. However, it is important to note that data for SY 2019-20 are not comparable to prior schoolyears of reporting, because of widespread school closures that occurred nationally beginning in March of 2020, which were prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These school closures had the effect of truncating the reporting timeline, because students were not present on campus for in-person instruction for approximately a quarter of the school year.

With many students not on campus for in-person instruction, incidents of firearm possession and related disciplinary actions were generally lower than in previous years, even with SY 2019-20 being truncated due to COVID-19 related closures across the country. Any year to-year comparative data should be interpreted with caution.

The guide is intended to support educators and education leaders to create systems of mutual care and shift the paradigm about what safety is and how it is achieved, building safe schools through an &quot;asset frame,&quot; which means defining people by their strengths and aspirations rather than their deficits and challenges. Further, working from this paradigm of safety and centering the lived experiences of students and families--especially those who have been kept furthest from institutional power--can be a key component of designing systems that are more equitable and sustainable. This interactive guide pulls from different frameworks and concepts, including &quot;complex adaptive systems,&quot; &quot;restorative justice,&quot; &quot;co-designing&quot;, and &quot;design thinking,&quot; to provide educators, school leaders, and district administrators with mindsets, strategies, and grounded examples of what is possible by reimagining school safety.",

        "description":"Providing high-level support to students on NGSS inquiry practices can be challenging; however, teacher dashboards can help teachers provide just-in-time instruction to students, both in-person and online. Prior work has shown some success with a dashboard that alerts teachers in real time on students' science inquiry difficulties, but teachers differed in their use of the alerts. To further support teachers, we designed a second iteration, in which the alerts included actionable, evidence-based Teacher Inquiry Practice Supports (TIPS), a series of suggested scaffolds that teachers can use to support students on the practices with which they are struggling. In this study, we investigate how the discursive support patterns from one teacher differed when using the dashboard alerts &quot;without&quot; TIPS followed by &quot;with&quot; TIPS. Findings suggest that TIPS influenced how the teacher incorporated different types of support for her students, and further, that the support given varied across different virtual lab stages.

        "description":"As higher education institutions across Colorado continue to address the impact of COVID19 on enrollment and identify practices that promote student success and institutional sustainability, many are focusing their attention on the enrollment of adult learners. The Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE) has actively engaged in building awareness and understanding of the demographic changes impacting postsecondary attainment. In doing so, CDHE aligned its attainment practices for adults 25 to 64 with Lumina Foundation's Path Toward Equity Tool, which seeks to reach 66% completion nationally by 2025. However, despite having the second highest attainment rate in the country amongst adults 25-64, alarming racial and ethnic disparities continue to exist amongst Coloradoans who identify as African American/Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Hispanic/Latinx in comparison to their White counterparts. These gaps cannot be solved in isolation or by one institution type. However, community colleges can be one of the solutions to higher attainment rates and equity gaps. The open access mission and commitment to the social and economic mobility of underserved and underrepresented student populations such as racially minoritized adults ages 25-64 make community colleges a smart choice for students to further their education and/or workforce development. Nevertheless, in order to be a solution, various considerations need to be addressed. This brief provides an overview of the legislature and equity efforts and present recommendations for community colleges to apply equity-minded practices in closing the attainment gap amongst racially diverse students.",

        "description":"The Kauffman School is a public, tuition-free charter school serving Kansas City students. In the 2019-20 school year, the school enrolled 1,186 students in grades 5 through 12. Most (88 percent) of the students were low income, and 89 percent were Black or Hispanic. To measure the impact of the Kauffman School on its students, the authors identified a group of students in other Kansas City district and charter schools who had similar demographic characteristics and achievement at the end of 4th grade. They compared outcomes for those students to the outcomes of Kauffman students in 5th grade through high school graduation and enrollment in college. During March 2020, the Kauffman School switched to virtual instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as did all schools in Missouri. Because attendance and suspension data were not tracked during the fourth quarter of 2019-20, the results in this report are based on the first three quarters of that year. This report discusses the impact of the Kauffman School on college enrollment, high school graduation, attendance, and suspensions. Key findings include: (1) Substantial positive impacts on enrollment in four-year colleges; (2) Impact on enrollment in four-year colleges compares favorably to those found in studies of other high-performing charter schools; (3) Eighty percent of Kauffman School graduates enrolled in a four-year college; (4) Positive impact on attendance; and (5) Reduced suspensions.",

(2022) say county density of cross-class friendships (referred to here as &quot;adult-bridging capital&quot;) has causal impacts on social mobility within the United States. We instead find that social mobility rates are a function of county density of family capital (higher marriage rates and two-person households), community capital (community organizations, religious congregations, and volunteering), and mean student achievement in grades 3-8. Our models use similar multiple regression equations and the same variables employed by Chetty et al. but also include state fixed effects, student achievement, and family, community, schoolbridging (cross-class high school friendships), and political (participation and institutional trust) capital. School-bridging capital is weakly correlated with mobility if adult-bridging is excluded from the model. R-squared barely changes when adult-bridging is incorporated into the model. When it is included, mobility continues to be significantly correlated with the achievement, family, and community variables but not with school-bridging and political ones. We infer that county mobility rates are largely shaped by parental presence, community life, and student achievement. To enhance mobility, public policy needs to enhance the lives of disadvantaged people at home, in school, and in communities, not just the social class of their friendships.",

Academic assessments that intend to capture what these students know and can do, are not always designed in ways that allow students to do so nor are they designed to support educators in recognizing student excellence when they see it. In this way, assessments may underestimate Indigenous students' skills and knowledge and interfere with, rather than support, their academic success--from course grades, to specialized program placement, to graduation and attending college.

The first report in the series utilized survey data from school safety key informants (e.g., SSSC staff, state educational agency [SEA] staff, policymakers) who were knowledgeable about the current SSSC context and their state's SSSC history (McKenna et al., 2021). The report focused specifically on SSSCs over the past 2 decades, after the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999. To build on the first report, this report describes the characteristics, practices, structures, and services of current SSSCs to examine variation in SSSC landscape, structure, and activities. The specific objectives of the evaluation are to: (1) document the history of SSSCs across the United States following the massacre at Columbine High School, a seminal school safety event in 1999 that prompted the creation of several SSSCs; (2) describe the characteristics, practices, structures, and services of current SSSCs; (3) assess the perceived impact of SSSC services from the perspective of diverse stakeholders, including SSSC intensive service users, SEA and state Department of Justice (SDOJ) staff, policymakers, SROs, district superintendents, and school principals; and (4) utilize the information collected to develop a framework that outlines promising structures and practices to facilitate the development and improvement of SSSCs and to guide future research to examine the impacts and outcomes associated with SSSC practices.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the in-person summer program was adapted to a 19-day (67-hour) online synchronous summer program for summer 2020. This report follows students who attended the in-person summer program in 2019 and the online summer program in 2020. It analyzes results for incoming grades 6 and 7 students in summer 2019 and incoming grades 7 and 8 students in summer 2020 and a 2-year component that analyzed results for the returning incoming grades 7 and 8 students in summer 2020. Key findings include: (1) Two years of participation in Elevate [Math] raised students' probability of earning a passing grade and earning a B or higher in their math courses; (2) The 2020 program participants experienced a slightly larger 1-year impact on course grades than did 2019 program participants; (3) In comparison to nonparticipants, students who participated in Elevate [Math] for 2 years scored higher on the standardized math assessment after the second year; (4) Compared to nonparticipants, grade 7 students who attended the Elevate [Math] program for two summers earned higher assessment scores and were more likely to earn a math grade of B or higher; and (5) Patterns of impacts on standardized math assessment scores and course grades were not consistent for other subgroups of students, including groups defined by student race/ethnicity and free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) participation.",

        "description":"The &quot;Roadmap of Need&quot; is a whole child needs assessment for North Carolina youth, produced annually by the Public School Forum of North Carolina's Center for Afterschool Programs (NC CAP). The Roadmap includes 20 indicators of wellness across four domains: health, youth behavior and safety, education, and economic development. These four domains capture the interconnected social, emotional, and academic elements that are necessary for a child to succeed, both inside and outside of the classroom. Taking the approach of a whole child needs assessment is critical to understanding what is necessary for each child to have in order to thrive in school and in life. The publication's examination of 20 indicators represent data that demonstrate various needs across North Carolina, with each indicator being used to identify where young people are most at risk of not succeeding. In addition to county-specific data on each indicator, the Roadmap provides rankings for each indicator and domain, as well as an overall ranking of all 100 counties that takes into account the data on all 20 indicators.

The challenges and deep inequities facing schools today are largely the result of decades of disinvestment, compounded by a global pandemic. All of this has led to a breaking point for the system of public education. In 2023, lawmakers and stakeholders are urged to recognize the responsibility to act quickly to meet the needs of each and every student in North Carolina. The top education issues highlighted in this brief document represent the Public School Forum's policy agenda for the 2023-24 biennium. They include: (1) Ensure fair and competitive compensation for educators; Grow, retain, and diversify the teacher pipeline; (3) Address the root causes of mental health and school safety crises; (4) Prepare students for the world they live in; and (5) Implement, monitor, and evaluate the Comprehensive Remedial Plan.

Based on a review of leading frameworks and research, together with significant input from experts, the E-W Framework offers holistic guidance for translating data into action to identify and address disparities through detailed guidance on the following: (1) Data equity principles to support ethical data use across the data life cycle; (2) Essential questions that every E-W data system should be equipped to answer; (3) Indicators that matter most along the E-W continuum for states and localities to measure; (4) Key student characteristics to inform data disaggregation; and (5) Illustrative evidenced-based practices shown to move the needle on key outcomes. Through improved data systems, policies, and practices, policymakers, administrators, practitioners, community organizations, and researchers will be better poised to support the individuals least well served by current education and workforce systems in achieving economic mobility and security.

Participants of the study--31 EFL students at Suez Faculty of Education, Suez Canal University--were pretested on teaching skills. Each participant completed a Pedagogical Action Research Project as part of the ELT Methodology course they studied that term. In completing the projects, participants 1) identified and limited topics, 2) reviewed the literature related to these topics, 3) developed research plans, 4) implemented the plans and collected data, 5) analyzed the data, 6) developed action plans, 7) shared and communicated the results they reached and finally 8) reflected on the whole process. Participants were posttested on teaching skills. Results revealed that participants achieved significant gains in teaching skills between pretest and posttest. Therefore, it was recommended that action research be used as a tool for professional development of Egyptian EFL teachers.

To inform state preschool administrators and policymakers as they refine their mixed delivery systems, this report describes the mixed delivery systems of five states that have taken different approaches to supporting providers across settings. The five states discussed in this report include: (1) Alabama; (2) Michigan; (3) New Jersey; (4) New York; and (5) West Virginia. This report answers the following questions: (1) What is the landscape of mixed delivery in select states' preschool programs? (2) How are state preschool contracts awarded, and what supports are provided to non-LEAs to participate? and (3) What are quality requirements, and who monitors and is ultimately responsible for program quality?",

        "description":"The aim of this research was to identify the teaching practices and student support services that facilitate the successful online delivery of vocational education and training (VET), including in blended delivery. To achieve this, the research examined the characteristics of teaching approaches and student support services across eight qualifications delivered online, with these qualifications also representing diverse student cohorts (including apprentices and trainees), industry types and Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) levels. Using information collected from interviews with 37 registered training organisations (RTOs) who deliver at least one of the eight case-study qualifications, it explored: (1) how teaching practices and student support services vary across the diverse VET system (that is, differing RTO type, student cohort, training type and industry) and across delivery mode (that is, blended and fully online delivery, synchronous and asynchronous delivery); and (2) the elements of VET that are being delivered online, including for apprentices and trainees.

        "description":"Experts in the field of family and school partnerships have called for a shift from a focus on engagement to a focus on empowerment of parents, guardians, and caregivers to improve education outcomes for historically marginalized students. Although the terms &quot;engage&quot; and &quot;empower&quot; are often used interchangeably in the research, there is a significant difference in terms of practice. Family engagement generally refers to educators inviting families to participate in school-related activities. More than 50 years of research indicates that family engagement is one of the most powerful predictors of a child's development, educational attainment, and success in school and life. Family empowerment occurs when educators and schools remove the barriers to and provide opportunities for families to gain agency and influence their schools' communities to bring about positive change in their children's schooling. Empowerment involves a mutually shared effort to reach mutually identified learning goals for an individual child or for all children in a school or district. To support educational equity in terms of both opportunity and outcomes, families must be empowered by schools, districts, and communities to support their children's learning. Family empowerment occurs when educators and schools remove the barriers to and provide opportunities for families to gain agency and influence their schools' communities to bring about positive change in their children's schooling. Empowerment involves a mutually shared effort to reach mutually identified learning goals for an individual child or for all children in a school or district. To support educational equity in terms of both opportunity and outcomes, families must be empowered by schools, districts, and communities to support their children's learning. This brief presents a narrative synthesis and is based on a partial review of the relevant literature on strategies for engaging and, more recently, empowering families to support their children's learning and development. The brief also reviews and summarizes lessons learned from this research, and offers recommendations for how local education agencies can engage and empower families.

Public community and technical colleges offer a relatively affordable, open-access option for students seeking higher education. Community colleges also provide an array of services to support students along their educational journey, and it is increasingly evident that basic needs supports should be among the services offered. Food insecurity, housing insecurity, and other basic needs insecurities are prevalent among community and technical college students in Washington. In response to these needs, United Way of King County (UWKC) launched the Bridge to Finish campaign to implement a successful basic needs delivery model, provide these services to current students, build evidence to influence policy, and contribute knowledge to the broader conversation on the benefits of a culture of care for community and technical college students. This report shares insights from the collaborative study by providing information on characteristics of Bridge to Finish participants, patterns of service receipt, and rates of successful academic outcomes. The report highlights ways to help Bridge to Finish and other similar programs prepare for a rigorous impact evaluation.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for high-quality supports focused on families' health, education, and employment needs. As service delivery organizations have worked to meet these needs, they have been stretched thin. The complex challenges these organizations faced have increased the need for them to engage partners across sectors, including research and philanthropy, to better support staff members and families. The Refining Virtual Services to Engage 2G Families project (REVISE 2G) emerged as one such partnership. The collaborative effort between Mathematica, Agape Child &amp; Family Services (Agape), and the Annie E. Casey Foundation (Casey) aimed to help Agape, a place-based service provider in Memphis, Tennessee, strengthen its two-generation paradigm (2Gen) in the face of COVID-19 and the transition to virtual services. Through equity-focused capacity building, the partners helped 2Gen staff members address opportunity areas for two initiatives: Stars, a school-based mentoring initiative for youth, and TeamWorks, a coaching initiative to help adults meet their education and employment goals. The change efforts revealed key lessons for two-generation organizations, and their research and philanthropic partners, to consider when using rapid-cycle learning to enhance services for young people and their families.

E-learning makes use of multimedia technologies to enhance teaching and learning. However, the readiness to E-learning is influenced by many factors and hence, the current study aimed at exploring the influence of Gender, Location of Institution and Type of Institution on the E-learning Readiness (ELR) of Students. The sample of the study consisted of 57 students of higher education institutions of the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir. The students were asked to rate their readiness to E-learning on a five-point symmetric likert scale consisting of 43 items related to various dimensions of ELR. The collected data was analysed with the help of SPSS V26. The statistical techniques like Independent Samples t-test was used to test the hypotheses. The results of the study reveal that Gender, Location of Institution and Type of Institution have no significant influence on the ELR of Students. The study concludes by giving further suggestions for research in this area.",

The study assessed the contribution of strategic questioning to the improvement and development of the foundation of knowledge of learners to come up with improved performance and developed a plan of strategic questioning. The experimental evaluation design-posttest only was used with posttest for both control and experimental groups. The experimental groups were exposed to the treatment. Data gathered through a checklist and plan for strategic questioning were developed. Two hundred twenty-five students under the researcher were randomly selected as control and experimental groups. Data were statistically treated with percentage, mean, standard deviation, t-test, and p-test. It was found out that there was a significant difference between the performance of students in the controlled and experimental groups after instruction/intervention. This meant that strategic questioning as formative assessment contributes to the effective performance of the learners in mathematics. It can be inferred further that categorizing questioning to the lower level and higher level can really increase the learners' performance in math. The research revealed then that using contextualized problems/lessons as one form of strategic questioning in every quarter contributed to improving the learners' competence in solving math problems.",

        "description":"For far too long, the United States has neglected and wasted an enormous amount of human potential--much of it among groups that have never been given the opportunities they deserve. We're talking about bright students, advanced learners, striving pupils, and those with high but untapped potential--especially those who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, low income, or from otherwise marginalized backgrounds--whose educational needs aren't being satisfactorily met by our schools. In response to this and a rash of high-profile, related controversies, the National Working Group on Advanced Education was formed in Spring 2022. It met four times since then, with two goals in mind: developing a robust research agenda and developing a policy and practice agenda. This document is the product of that work, and comprises thirty-six recommendations for how districts, charter networks, and states can build a continuum of advanced learning opportunities, customized to individual students' needs and abilities, that spans the K-12 spectrum.

        "description":"The Indian community consists of 2.21% disabled people, whose capabilities and strengths are often not recognized by the majority abled population. This inability to identify the specially abled population as co-contributing members of the society hampers their social and educational development. Despite policies and strategies for supportive integration and inclusive education, the beneficial impact remains to be low. There is a desperate need for the Indian community to work towards social integration and self-actualization. This study aims at discovering the degree of awareness about the specially abled population among the younger Indian population. The study is a cross sectional observational study conducted across Pune city, India done in normal school going children aged 9-12 years old. Data collection was done for 116 children for the duration of 7 months in 2021-22. The questionnaire involved personal response questions, tables to be ticked and drawing pictures. The open ended questions focused on getting answers about awareness about their perception of the disabled and their capabilities, their attitude towards such humans, and their skills about communicating with humans having different disabilities. Awareness about disability was observed to be low and more candidates knew about the term 'Handicap' than 'specially abled'. Knowledge about the capabilities of disabled was found to be poor although most candidates portrayed empathetic and accepting attitude towards the specially abled. Relevant skills of the participating children such as the ability to communicate with the specially abled was variable and depended on the category of disability. Further research related to social strata can be conducted to find the correlation between social background and level of awareness about disability. The paper suggests designing and implementing programs as a probable solution to increase the general level of awareness about the specially-abled among school going children. Moreover, developing empathy amongst young malleable minds would also promote social integration. This would potentially increase disability integration achieved in educational institutions consequently leading to higher rates of literacy in the future.

Higher education is now more widely available thanks to these online universities that provide online courses and degrees. In this paper, I will give an overview of the virtual university scene, look at the development of online learning over time, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of virtual universities. We also talk about new developments in online education, such as the advent of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the gamification of education, and the application of AI and machine learning in the educational setting. Finally, we look at concerns with accreditation, quality assurance, and student participation, as well as opportunities and challenges for virtual universities. We seek to provide a thorough grasp of the virtual university landscape and its possible effects on higher education through this analysis.

This review paper examines the mobilization of the ethnographic research approach reported in studies from two distinctive learning contexts: an elementary school and a vocational college. Employing the specific evaluative criteria of Punch (2005), the desk-based study draws on existing literature to document the strengths and limitations of ethnographic method and reportage to reveal edifying insights to novice and experienced qualitative researchers who may be contemplating an ethnographic study in the future. The review reveals how extensive ethnography lends itself well to presenting thick descriptions in rich narratives to demonstrate high veracity. In contrast, this research approach may be limited in its verisimilitude, especially if ethnographers abridge their methodological and analytical descriptions and fail to acknowledge reactivity.",

The descriptive design was employed involving all the basic education teachers and using a survey-checklist to gather pertinent data. The data were treated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The teachers knew the goals and objectives of the enhanced program but were lacking information, skills and expertise in delivering the curriculum. They were aware relative to the areas on curriculum development, teacher education and training, instruction, career guidance and assessment. Moreover, they were highly aware on the goals and objectives of the enhanced basic education program. The teachers were able to show that being aware of the enhanced program is not sufficient for them to become effective teachers of the new curriculum. Thus, there is a need for further information and skills enhancement regarding the Program. The department should devise strategies on how to impart knowledge, information, trainings and seminars to teachers.",

Parental incarceration has been linked to an array of consequences for children's development and well-being, spanning most developmental domains and all developmental stages. The overarching goal of this report is to briefly summarize the associations between parental incarceration and adverse outcomes across various aspects of child well-being and development (Section I), and to discuss the role of policy (Section II) in both contributing to mass parental incarceration in the U.S. (Section II.A.) and addressing the many impacts of parental incarceration in the U.S. on child well-being and development (Section II.B.). Throughout this report, we acknowledge impacts and additional considerations related to families of color, who are disproportionately affected by incarceration and associated policies.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to describe the experiences of St. Scholastica's College Manila High School librarians in implementing library online services during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The researcher used a descriptive research design and employed Document Analysis and Thematic Analysis vis-a-vis the respondents' answers on the electronic questionnaires. It was revealed, through this study, that the roles and responsibilities of the SSC Manila HS librarians were technologists, online learning support professionals, instructional partners, and game-based learning developers. On the other hand, they experienced challenges such as having limited transactions and time constraints in delivering library online services and the opportunities of having proactive team culture and providing appropriate and innovative services to their clientele. With these findings, the following are recommended for better library online services of the school libraries and librarians. First, librarians and staff's technical competencies and skills must continuously be honed. Second, the library's online services must also be evaluated annually by the students and faculty members. Third, the librarians and staff must explore more technological applications or apps and learning management systems. Lastly, further research studies are recommended in relation also to delivering library online services that can be in the contexts of other types of libraries, most especially their experiences so that there will be a deeper and bigger understanding of the roles and responsibilities, and the challenges and opportunities of librarians during the COVID-19 Pandemic.",

This study was conducted to aid in achieving that objective and provide ways for educators to develop strategies that learners can perceive and appreciate, particularly those who are not inclined toward science. This study also utilized a qualitative research design and descriptive approach to understanding the learners' perspective in Evolutionary concepts. The majority of the respondents are believers in the theory of human evolution. Interviews were conducted to gather data. Most respondents expressed their belief that modern humans are successors of ape-like organisms. The majority of the same informants mentioned their need for clarity about the stages that humans underwent during history, while almost all of those respondents stated the utilization of various graphic materials to elucidate these evolutionary concepts. It was recommended that educators engage in learning methods that call the attention and those that the students can easily understand.",

        "title":"Ivrit&apos;s Place in the Dual Curriculum Model of Orthodox Jewish High Schools in North America",
        "author":["Klein, Reuven Chaim"],
        "description":"The dual curriculum model ubiquitous to Orthodox Jewish day schools in North America typically bifurcates into religious (Judaic) studies and general studies. While most classes generally fit into one of those two halves of the curriculum, some classes are not intuitively categorized as wholly belonging to one part over the other. One of those classes is &quot;Ivrit&quot; (Modern Hebrew). This study aims to describe &quot;Ivrit's&quot; place in the dual curriculum model and the various factors that contribute to that reality by exploring the context in which &quot;Ivrit&quot; emerged as a subject-matter for Orthodox schools and seeking to identify trends in the ways &quot;Ivrit&quot; is taught. This paper lays out the theories behind how ideology influences curriculum formation and documents how Hebrew has fit into the curriculum of Jewish Education throughout the ages. It also provides a picture of the particular context of North American Orthodox Jewry that this study focuses on, as well as a review of the different theories behind Hebrew education (heritage language vs. communicative language). With this theoretical background in hand, this dissertation surveyed 36 Orthodox high schools in North America to better understand how they viewed &quot;Ivrit's&quot; place and shows that ultimately this subject's place in the dual curriculum model remains ambiguous. Documenting how &quot;Ivrit&quot; is taught and examining the reasons as to why &quot;Ivrit&quot; is taught helped shed light on &quot;Ivrit's&quot; precarious place in the dual curriculum model, as some of those policies/techniques/motives seem to line up with the aims of the Judaic studies curriculum, while others seemingly reflect the goals of the general studies curriculum.",

To identify efficient ways to expand the reach of A2i, this study uses a school-level randomized controlled trial design to assess the relative effectiveness of two PD models in implementing A2i and improving student literacy achievement. Fifty-nine schools in 20 school districts were randomly assigned to either a mixed-mode PD delivery model that combines in-person and virtual PD activities or a face-to-face model that is tested and resource-intensive. A cohort of 4,733 first-graders in these schools was followed and their reading achievement tracked for three years. Due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the full implementation of A2i was not realized during the study period. As a result, while student achievement in reading was similar in mixed-mode and face-to-face schools across all three study years, such results might not reflect the actual relative effectiveness between the two PD models.",

        "description":"Thanks to rapid increases in the state's Hispanic and Asian populations, the number of Texas students classified as English Learners has surged in the past decade, from approximately 830,000 in 2010 to more than 1.1 million today. In the charter sector, change has been even more rapid. In 2010, 16 percent of charter students in Texas were classified as English Learners. Yet by 2021, that figure had nearly doubled to just under 30 percent, even as the share of all Texas students who enrolled in charters &quot;also&quot; doubled (and then some). Consequently, the total number of English Learners in Texas charters has quintupled in the past decade, from less than 25,000 in 2010 to nearly 120,000 in 2021. The rapid growth in Texas's English-Learner population puts a premium on analyzing the educational experiences of this student group, and the disproportionate share of this growth that has occurred in the state's charter sector makes it particularly important to understand how English Learners in that sector are faring. Accordingly, this report addresses three research questions: (1) How do the English Learners who enroll in Texas charter schools compare to their peers in traditional public schools?; (2) How do the academic and economic outcomes of English Learners in Texas charter schools compare to those of their peers in traditional public schools?; and (3) How have the academic outcomes of English Learners in Texas charter schools evolved as the number of English Learners in charters has increased? To address these questions, this report uses student-level data spanning much of the first two decades of this century and a wide range of analytic techniques. In so doing, it brings important new evidence to bear on the educational experiences of one of the fastest-growing student populations in one of the fastest-growing sectors in one of the fastest-growing states in the country.

This brief challenges the notion that college admissions exams are at the heart of inequities observed in college admissions, higher education attainment, and broader social disparities. More specifically, the brief addresses five ideas that have become conventional wisdom in some quarters: &quot;College admissions exams are racist,&quot; &quot;College admissions exams limit students' pathways into quality higher education,&quot; &quot;Other parts of college application packets promote equity better than entrance exams,&quot; &quot;Admissions officers should just focus on grades,&quot; and &quot;The future of college admissions is 'test optional.'&quot;",

        "description":"Over the past three decades, transition practices research has demonstrated that post-school outcomes of students with disabilities improve when educators, families, students, and community members and organizations work together to implement a broad perspective of transition planning, more appropriately referred to as transition-focused education. In general, this concept represents the perspective that &quot;transition planning&quot; is the fundamental basis of education that guides development of students' educational programs--including strategies that keep them in school--rather than an &quot;add-on&quot; activity for students with disabilities when they turn age 14 or 16. The impact of transition-focused education is greatly enhanced when service systems and programs connect and support the implementation and application of such learning. This report builds upon the earlier &quot;Taxonomy for Transition Programming&quot; (ED399722) and provides concrete practices--identified from effective programs and the research literature--for implementing transition-focused education. As indicated in the references at the end of this document, the Taxonomy 2.0 brings in the latest literature regarding predictors of post-school success, strategies to increase graduation and reduce dropout, school climate, and vocational rehabilitation services focused on fostering successful transition of youth with disabilities in college and careers. The model continues with five primary practice categories: (1) Student-Focused Planning; (2) Student Development; (3) Interagency Collaboration; (3) Family Engagement; and (5) Program Structure.",

        "description":"The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the application that postsecondary students complete to receive federal grants, work-study, and loans; as well as some state and institutional grants, and private financial aid. In 2019-2020, 17.7 million undergraduates filed a FAFSA and in 2021-2022, full-time equivalent students received an average of $15,330 in financial aid. While the percentage of undergraduate students filing the FAFSA has increased significantly in the past twenty years, it is estimated that over one-third of non-filers in the 2015-2016 school year would have qualified for the Federal Pell Grant. This brief examines data from 59,208 students at 104 higher education institutions that participated in Trellis' Fall 2021 Student Financial Wellness Survey (SFWS). The report focuses on self-reported FAFSA completion and reasons for not completing the FAFSA. Research indicates a link between filing a FAFSA and within-year persistence, year-to-year persistence, and earning a degree within six years. Therefore, understanding students' FAFSA completion rate and reasons for non-submission can inform strategies to help students remain in school and graduate on time.",

Sense of belonging can be strengthened by building relationships on campus through a variety of ways such as friendships, mentorships, and campus activities. This allows students to feel a connection with faculty and peers. A strong sense of belonging has been shown to increase retention, and ultimately graduation, as well as improving the mental health and overall wellbeing of students (Lu, 2023). An efficient way to gauge a student's sense of belonging is by surveying them. This brief discusses the Diverse Learning Environment (DLE) survey administered by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA. The purpose of the survey is to assess the experience of undergraduate students by asking questions about their interactions with faculty and peers, any engagement with co-curricular activities, opinions on campus climate, and their overall satisfaction with their collegiate experience. The data can then be utilized to better understand institutional practices, assess student learning outcomes, and identify strengths and areas of improvement for the campus.",

        "description":"Many factors impact intervention implementation in everyday practice, including the social validity of these interventions. As a way of addressing social validity, this study aimed to understand the perspectives of multiple stakeholders of school-aged children and adolescents who use aided and unaided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) on their key intervention priorities for these children. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 parents and professionals, which included special education teachers, paraprofessionals, and speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Qualitative content analysis focused on (a) identifying a framework of intervention priorities for children with complex communication needs and (b) understanding stakeholders' underlying values and attitudes that influenced perceptions about these priorities. Participants shared many intervention priorities and several core values. These intervention priorities included approaches focused on improving children's intrinsic abilities (i.e., skills-focused) and on improving children's extrinsic supports and opportunities (i.e., environment-focused). However, participants often portrayed diverging attitudes about different aspects of intervention, particularly self-efficacy (e.g., persistence in the face of challenges; confidence about inclusive education) and perceptions of students (e.g., keeping high expectations). These findings have important implications for practice and future research related to how attention to social validity can help bridge the research-to-practice gap.

Additionally, it is worth noting that educational culture worldwide is converging as indicated by world culture theory.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a disruption in higher education, especially posing considerable challenges to international students. Given the emphasis of international higher education in the U.S. and the prominence of Chinese international students in this country, as well as the sparsity of research outside large cities, this study sought to examine particular challenges posed to Chinese international students studying at universities in smaller cities in the U.S. Results indicate that this group of students experienced a myriad of hardships and challenges during the pandemic. Understanding these effects can inform international higher education programs perhaps worldwide, ultimately improving such programs to better manage crises, but also to improve normal practice.

        "description":"In practice, adult basic education activities are educational activities that adults engage in systematically so they can gain new forms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values for self-sustenance to ensure self-improvement and national development. Achieving these requires an appropriate approach which is vital for the participation of learners to ensure transformational results. However, the plague of COVID-19 created a disorientating dilemma for facilitators around the world, especially in developing countries like Nigeria, with little or no alternatives to regular physical contact learning-delivery systems using digital learning approaches. This imposed paradigm shift has created the need for flexible, adaptable, and sustainable delivery of adult basic education in Nigeria, while we await full utilization of digital learning. An adaptable Transformative learning delivery model which uses a blend of both transformative learning and each-one-teach-one approaches is proposed to achieve the dual-aim of adult basic education. The proposed learning-delivery model to be implemented by adult educators in Nigeria as well as other developing countries will assist learners to become active citizens for self-improvement and national development. This model suggests that facilitators will utilize the full participation of learners through their conscious and concerted efforts towards learning. In addition, facilitating learning with this model will show continual effort to attain sustainability of adult basic education, even in the advent of national or global uncertainties like COVID-19.

The economic, political, cultural, and social rights of citizens set the parameters of what is expected by citizens from the government as we exist and socialise in society. It is also what gives the legal backing to citizens and what protects them from undue interferences and pressure from individuals, corporate, and government organizations. In Nigeria, serious social issues infringe on the social rights of citizens. Problems of insecurity, regular kidnapping, unemployment, and low standard of living exist. Many believe these long-lingering social issues, which are rooted in corruption, can be curbed via adult education. This will in turn bring about improved democratic practice by the government so citizens are safe and protected. This paper discusses the concept of adult education and how it can promote social rights in the practice of Nigerian democracy in the post-COVID-19 era.

        "description":"This paper recaps Henschke's 2021 CIAE Pre-conference paper on the fact that the first 200 years of the epistemology and practice of adult education in the United States was almost exclusively sponsored by the Church. Even in ancient times from the Bible book of Ecclesiastes, third chapter, there are 14 sets of things [28 in number] that God set to occupy us in this life on earth; beside this He also placed 'eternity in our hearts.' Thus is identified an often-overlooked broad spectrum of adult education/ andragogical epistemology of religion, spirituality, and piety/devotion. My life has been mainly guided by what I declare as God's call(s) for me on earth and 'eternity in my heart' for the afterlife to come. This background will then be connected with this year's (2022) CIAE Pre-conference focus of the paper on a deeper probe into four major variations of caring and love exemplified and included in God's creation with elements, such as: Four sets of Greek, Hebrew words, and English explanations with supporting illustrations of caring and love; presented in the order mentioned above a. Eros, Yada, sublime intimate sexual love; b. Storge, Basar, the good news of 'I've got your back'; c. Philia, Rea, family relationships and common interests; and d. Agape, Ahav, God's eternal, divine love for humankind. All of this is set within this life on earth and in the afterlife (eternity) to come. [For the full proceedings, see ED628982.]",

The programme hopes to enhance teachers' and school leaders' capacity to deploy technology in classrooms and improve online and offline distance learning methods. Training needs assessment was conducted to ensure digital training was designed to fit the identified digital skills gap of teachers in Nigeria. This paper scrutinized secondary data to discuss various processes of the intervention. It further discussed outcomes of the programme on teachers who were target beneficiaries of the program and education in Nigeria. It then concluded with a focus on benefits of partnerships between donor agencies and Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), the training goal, desired outcomes, methodology, challenges, the way forward, and implications for school administrators on teaching and learning in Nigeria.

        "author":["Tsevi, Linda"],
        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all global spaces. Higher education institutions were not left out of the effect of COVID-19 as it impacted the teaching and learning needs of both faculty members and students. Through a comprehensive literature search, this paper explored teaching and learning in higher education institutions in a post-COVID era as a consequence to the pandemic. This review examined nine databases for peer-reviewed articles and book chapters published between 2020 and 2021 relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher education. The search terms used were 'COVID-19', 'blended learning', 'higher education', 'online learning', and 'post-COVID era'. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they related to the aforementioned items. The literature search revealed that higher education institutions in some countries, were least prepared to address the disruption that the pandemic caused especially in terms of availability of technological infrastructure. However, they adapted to the situation by being innovative and using available technological resources, though not without challenges. Further, the review indicated that COVID-19 has legitimized the acceptance of online education in most developing countries where traditional teaching methods have been the most recognized form of teaching and learning. Therefore, there was a need for retraining faculty members and support staff in digital literacy. Some of the teaching and learning methods that were adapted have continued even in the post-COVID era. Higher education in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially, has recognized the need for investment in extensive ICT infrastructure and the adaptation of a blend of face to face and online engagement of students. Varied ways of student assessment and innovative methods of teaching have been adopted. COVID-19 has fast-tracked higher education institutions' digital transformation by expediting the adoption of digital technology. The digital inequality educational divide has also been shown in the post-COVID era among others. [For full proceedings, see ED628982.]",

        "description":"Task-Based Instruction (TBI) is a dynamic approach in tertiary language education that emphasizes the integration of authentic and meaningful tasks to enhance language learning outcomes. This study aims to explore the implementation of TBI in the Philippines, investigate its cognitive benefits and transformative nature, identify pedagogical considerations, and provide recommendations for optimization. The study employed a qualitative research design, with data collected from five private schools in Iligan City. A purposive sampling procedure was used to select 20 participants who engaged in interviews, focus group discussions, and thematic analysis. The results revealed that TBI positively influenced language proficiency, cognitive development, learner autonomy, intercultural competence, and pedagogical considerations. Participants reported enhanced language skills and increased confidence in real-life language use. They also highlighted the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills through engaging in challenging tasks. TBI was found to empower learners by promoting autonomy, ownership, and self-directed learning. Additionally, it cultivated intercultural communicative competence and fostered appreciation for diverse perspectives. Pedagogical considerations included task design, clear instructions, scaffolding, and feedback, while recommendations focused on optimizing TBI, integrating technology-enhanced learning, and supporting professional development for educators. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on TBI in tertiary language education and underscores its potential for creating transformative learning experiences. The findings provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers in enhancing language education practices in the Philippines and beyond.",

IXL's proposed optimal usage guideline for students to strive to reach proficiency in at least two skills per week (2 SP/week) is based on a comprehensive analysis of various usage levels and associated outcomes (An, 2021a). This 2 SP/week implementation and usage goal encompasses a number of important characteristics (e.g., specificity, proximity, and appropriate difficulty) that are tied to achieving better learning outcomes as suggested by the literature.

This article highlights the connection between language, literature, critical thinking, moral reasoning, and values integration in education. Through language and literature, teachers can incorporate values education in their classroom, which can benefit not only individual students but also society as a whole. Theoretical frameworks such as character education, moral education, and values education provide the basis for this approach. The researcher recommends strategies for incorporating values integration in language and literature curricula, including the use of literary texts that promote critical thinking and moral reasoning skills. The limitations of this approach, including the challenges in assessing the effectiveness of values integration and potential resistance from some stakeholders, are also discussed. Ultimately, this article aims to call on educators to take a proactive role in promoting values integration in language and literature education, guided by the principles of Jesus Christ and the belief that education is not only about acquiring knowledge but developing character as well. Moreover, this concept has a significant and lasting impact on students' overall development that highlights the importance of values and moral reasoning needed to live a better life.",

One way to support this learning in adult higher education is to offer education abroad programs -- often short-term international field experiences led by faculty for adult students. In the current study, we investigated experiences of adult education/HRD faculty who have experience teaching in such programs; additionally, we explored what and how they have learned in order to do so. Through the amalgamated conceptual framework of learning readiness, communities of practice, and motivational learning theory, we offer preliminary analyses of interviews conducted with five tenured/tenure-track faculty members about their motivations and professional development in advance of leading these programs.

        "description":"Migration is a significant life event that usually triggers cross-cultural preparedness and the need for learning, even transformative learning. This exploratory study answers two research questions: How do Nigerian immigrants describe their preparedness for cross-cultural transition in Italy? What are the indications of transformative learning processes and outcomes in the immigrants' narrations? Emerging results from six semi-structured interviews with six Nigerian immigrants in Italy are presented. Narratives and themes from the interviews showed evidence of preparation (nonlearning and learning) as well as nonpreparation for cross-cultural transition among the immigrants. Participants' preparedness was associated with their motivation to emigrate, cross-cultural experiences, and proficiency in the Italian language. Also, their cross-cultural experiences pointed to different aspects in processes and outcomes of transformative learning. Disorienting dilemmas of individual participants were identified. The study concluded a further inquiry could show how Nigerian immigrants' cross-cultural transition leads to various outcomes of transformative learning. [For full proceedings, see ED628982.]",

        "description":"Drawing on theories from transcultural theory, I examined Chinese immigrant mothers' transcultural perspectives on mothering and learning. Recent adult educational studies contain limited research on the effects of cultural influence on mothering and learning by immigrant mothers from their perspective. Based on 30 semi-structured interviews among Chinese immigrant mothers in Canada, this study revealed there are not only interactions between the fluid cultural values and the understanding of mothering and learning by immigrant mothers, but also race, gender, and class relations behind Chinese immigrant mothers' mothering and learning practice. This paper contributes to a better understanding of cultural influence on Chinese immigrant mothers' learning and mothering practice. The findings help foster adult educational programs for immigrant mothers in multicultural societies. [For full proceedings, see ED628982.]",

        "description":"Across the United States, students attending rural school districts can face different obstacles than their urban counterparts, particularly rural students from households living below the federal poverty level. But how rural districts are defined can vary by federal, state, and local entity and can sometimes not capture the difficulties specific districts face. The authors examine the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) definitions of rurality--the predominant avenue of federal funding for rural districts--and compare these definitions with how states define &quot;rural&quot; in their own funding formulas. The authors show that these definitions often identify different districts, and they investigate how summary data on district demographics, staffing, revenues, and expenditures vary across these different definitions. Based on the findings in this report, the authors recommend the following: (1) States should consider incorporating a &quot;small&quot; school district component into support systems, either for the first time or in addition to other components; (2) States should reevaluate (or evaluate for the first time) which definitions determine eligibility for funding; and (3) Researchers should consider the geographic context of their research and which definitions of rurality are most appropriate. The pandemic has had significant consequences for rural students, who often lacked internet and other supports necessary to learn from home. It is crucial that policymakers understand how state and federal definitions of rurality affect their understanding of rural districts' needs and resources to support students who are often already at a disadvantage.",

The fund leverages a tax on individuals earning more than $250,000 a year to sustainably fund supplemental payments to early educators in efforts to address longstanding inequities and achieve pay parity with public school teachers with a comparable degree. In spring 2022, the authors surveyed 137 DC residents who had newly enrolled a child in a licensed DC child care program. They held virtual focus groups with a subsample of 39 survey respondents in fall 2022, just as the first Pay Equity Fund payments were rolling out, to probe on specific survey findings around search process difficulty and child care experiences. During the focus groups, the authors asked parents and legal guardians about their experiences with staff turnover in their child care programs as well as their thoughts about the pay supplements and how their children's teachers could benefit. In this fact sheet, the authors summarize parents' thoughts on the Pay Equity Fund payments and their suggestions for additional ways the District could help child care programs recruit and retain qualified staff.",

Under the proposed income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, most undergraduate borrowers with typical debt levels--and nearly 90 percent of those with certificates and associate's degrees--would have at least some of their loans forgiven if they enroll in IDR. Under the newly announced plan, most undergraduates who take on typical debt loads would have at least some of their loans forgiven if they use the plan. Borrowers with certificates or associate's degrees would benefit the most, with 89 percent receiving some forgiveness and 38 percent paying nothing. The proposed IDR plan is the most generous yet, but it will make the student loan program significantly more expensive and risks encouraging students to take on more debt, which could have implications for their personal finances even if it is eventually forgiven.",

As of the 2021-22 school year, 87 percent of teachers in the state were White, compared with only 54 percent of students. In response to this disparity, Massachusetts lawmakers have proposed legislation targeting the shortage of teachers of color. In this report, the author uses data on Massachusetts K-12 public school students and teachers to provide evidence on three leaks in the teacher pipeline that policies could target to support teaching candidates of color. The sample consists of Massachusetts public school students from the high school graduating classes of 2003 to 2013 who indicated an interest in teaching by taking the state's Communications and Literacy Skills Test (CLST), which is required for teacher licensure.",

In response, schools have instituted preparedness and response measures, including school-shooter drills. This essay examines the relationship between active-shooter drills and two school accountability outcomes: attendance rates and proficiency rates on statewide end-of-year tests. There are two main results. First, in English and math, students in grades three through five who test on the school days immediately after an active-shooter drill have lower proficiency rates than their counterparts who test on the days and weeks before the drill. But proficiency rates return to typical levels as tests are administered in the weeks following the week of the drill. Second, attendance rates are slightly lower during quarters when active-shooter drills occur, relative to quarters without these drills.",

To help fulfill that mission, ACT offers school-day testing programs that provide all students with state- or district-funded access to its college readiness and admissions assessment, removing barriers to testing and opening doors to postsecondary opportunities. During the 2021-2022 academic year, over 1.3 million students, across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, participated in ACT school-day testing through state or district testing programs. Of these 1.3 million students, it is estimated that 59% could be considered members of underserved student populations according to at least one criterion. In this brief, the authors describe six evidence-backed benefits of school-day ACT testing: (1) Removes Barriers to Testing; (2) Increases the Number of Students Identified as College Ready; (3) Increases the Number of Students Who Are Contacted by Colleges; (4) Provides a Complete Picture for Research; (5) Leads to Improvement in College Enrollment; and (6) Provides Valuable Information to Students Navigating Different Paths.",

        "description":"With the rapid advances in technology (e.g., the internet, hardware, and software), technology-supported learning environments have widely emerged in K-16 learning and instruction. A survey found that 73% of teachers had their students use smartphones to conduct internet searches, and almost half of students reported using e-readers and tablets to complete in-class assignments (Purcell et. al., 2013). More recently, a survey of high school students (Moore &amp; Vitale, 2018) reported daily use of technology or technological devices for school-related activities, including checking grades, emailing the teacher, researching information, and using school related web-based applications. The integration of educational technology (EdTech) or digital tools into learning and instruction is essential to education success. In this study, the authors aim to examine student factors that may contribute to their usage of EdTech or digital tools for learning by looking at students' self-reported usage of a wide range of tools designed to aid students in learning activities within their schools. Students' use of different learning technologies was examined in a model with three core constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model, two external constructs (i.e., self-efficacy and cognitive engagement), and three background measures (i.e., student-computer ratio at school, poverty level at the school, and students' high school grade point average).",

Caregivers play a critical role in SEL by modeling and reinforcing their students' SE skill development.

These programs support a diverse set of educational opportunities--from certificate programs to associate and bachelor's degrees. They are available to help cover the costs of tuition for many low- and middle-income students. Washington's commitment to helping students pursue postsecondary opportunities continues to grow as state financial aid programs grow. Many more students could access financial aid by completing a financial aid application. Students must apply for federal or state financial aid with a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or a Washington Application for State Financial Aid (WASFA). In 2022, only about half of high school seniors in the state completed a FAFSA. Washington historically ranks near the bottom in FAFSA completion nationally. Like other states, Washington's FAFSA completion got even worse during the COVID-19 pandemic as fewer students applied for financial aid or enrolled in postsecondary education and training. The Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC) has led efforts to address this challenge and raise awareness about the state's many financial aid and postsecondary opportunities.

Federal student aid provided through Pell grants, work study, and loans can offer students with low incomes an avenue toward receiving a postsecondary education. But for students to be eligible for federal student aid, they need to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Many students who could benefit from federal aid often neglect to submit a FAFSA form because of various barriers, including a lack of awareness about different financial aid options, a lack of understanding about the eligibility requirements, and the FAFSA form's complexity. Despite FAFSA's potential to promote access to postsecondary education, the national FAFSA completion rate was just 53.8 percent for the high school class of 2019. To increase FAFSA completion rates, Louisiana (in 2017) and Illinois (in 2020) introduced mandatory FAFSA completion policies. Following their lead, Texas implemented a mandatory FAFSA completion policy as a graduation requirement beginning in the 2021-22 school year. Although higher education enrollment data are not yet available for 2022-23, Texas hopes that the increase in the number of students who filled out FAFSA applications will in turn create more access to financial aid and to postsecondary education. With other states in the planning stages for implementing similar policies, the early results from Texas can offer key insights on best practices when introducing their own policies.",

        "description":"Today's learners are looking to explore career options that allow them to change their communities and often the language used to communicate careers and skill-building falls short of connecting a career path with a learner's passion. Similarly, while employers are searching for ways to increase dedication and retention among employees while also building a robust talent pipeline, employers are challenged to connect the skills and knowledge gained in Career Technical Education (CTE) programs to their employment needs. &quot;Contribution to Society: Exploring Purpose-Driven Framing for Career Pathways&quot; builds the case for purpose-driven framing for career advising, shares the results from preliminary research into this type of framing and lays out both implications for different populations and future work needed to validate and implement this framing. To better understand &quot;contribution to society&quot; as a frame for CTE, Advance CTE commissioned focus groups of both CTE and non-CTE learners at different levels and conducted in-depth interviews with business professionals responsible for hiring across six industries. Advance CTE's preliminary research shows that: (1) Titles and descriptions of programs of study or industry sectors alone are insufficient for effective advising; (2) Employers often misunderstand titles and descriptions of CTE programs or pathways and that these descriptions of programs do not consistently align with descriptions of their work; and that (3) The most effective framing of a program of study--for both learners and employers--links a learner's contribution to society to their career goals. This resource was made possible through the generous support of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Additional appreciation goes to Edge Research for participant recruitment and focus groups and interview facilitation.",

        "author":["Singer, Jeremy"],
        "description":"Michigan policymakers and advocates are calling on the state to adopt a new school funding formula that provides additional funding to students with greater educational need, such as students with greater economic need. For Michigan students who have been identified as economically disadvantaged, at least a 35 percent weight is necessary for schools and districts to support those students' academic progress and material and social-emotional well-being. Yet some of these low-income students face greater economic need, and districts with the highest concentrations of economic disadvantage serve many more students in poverty and deep poverty. A poverty-based measure would require new administrative data linkages to implement, but it would most directly target the highest-need students. If policymakers prefer to more heavily target funds at the highest-poverty districts (or if linking tax and education data is not feasible), a concentration-based measure is an alternative. In either case, a fully funded high-need weight is necessary to ensure adequate funding for these students. There are other considerations for Michigan policymakers as they specify a high-need weight in its framework: (1) policymakers should calculate the total costs of a new funding formula with a high-need weight included; and (2) states need to identify individual students' household incomes. Finally, in addition to a new high-need measure, the state could use existing indicators that clearly signal greater economic need. Students identified as being homeless, being a migrant, living in foster care, or being in a family receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits could be automatically identified as high need, as these all directly indicate adverse economic experiences.",

These positive and negative experiences affected the holistic disposition of teachers thus, in every small group discussion -- both formal and informal, their predicaments regarding their experiences on class management were the primary topic. For this reason, this hermeneutic phenomenological qualitative study focuses on the experiences of the teachers and reflect upon the lived experiences of teachers in class management. This study utilized the criterion sampling where ten participants were selected from the teachers of Grade 7 to Grade 10. The data were gathered using semi-structured interview and were analyzed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The findings of this study demonstrated that teachers were bombarded with problems which cause them to lose their patience. These problems were on the behavior of the students. However, teachers recognized their role in the classroom and provided insightful innovation on combatting the problematic behavior of the students. Considering the management strategy and the personality of the teacher, they were able to realize that even if teaching is a tedious and arduous profession, teachers were still grateful because of their inspiration imparted, happy memories collected, and self-development gained from a fruitful experience in class management.",

Family engagement affects the development of these important skills (Brooks &amp; Lambert, 2019). As such, parents and caregivers are viewed as an integral part of social and emotional learning (SEL). For instance, the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) includes families and caregivers as part of their model of SEL (2023). Given the importance of family involvement, a growing number of studies have examined the perceptions of family members toward SEL. For example, studies have found that parents support teaching students SE skills in schools (Committee for Children, 2022; Daley et al., 2002; Horowitz, 2022; National PTA, 2022). Additionally, parents perceive SEL positively (Committee for Children, 2022; Murano et al., 2022) and think SE skills are important to develop (Daley et al., 2021). These positive perceptions suggest that caregivers are generally supportive of SEL. To examine this support more directly, the current study surveyed caregivers of high school students.",

The Legislature charged the State Board of Education (SBE) with reviewing the Profile of a Graduate and submitting a report to the Legislature in December 2022 with findings and recommendations. To inform the process of developing the recommendations for aligning graduation requirements with the Profile of a Graduate, the SBE held two series of listening sessions, in the spring to identify areas for recommendations, and in the fall to review draft recommendations. In developing these recommendations, the SBE was asked to consider the relationship between credits and core subject area requirements; potential changes to the requirements; and how the components of the diploma can work together better as a system. The recommendations along with SBE's budget request, respond to the findings developed through research on graduation pathways and through engagement with students, parents, and partners. These recommended changes would result in an education system and a system of graduation requirements that would be more flexible and relevant and would more clearly connect each student's learning to their individual goals for their education and career after high school.",

Graduation pathway options include tests and advanced courses in English language arts and math, Career and Technical Education course sequences, and the military vocational aptitude test (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery). In anticipation of potential barriers, the Legislature charged the State Board of Education with researching the first three years of pathways implementation to identify barriers and provide recommendations for changes to the existing pathways and additional pathways options. While implementation was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the research identified other challenges. Strobel Consulting collected District Survey, focus group and interview data during the third year of this three-year project to address: (1) Whether changes to the existing eight pathways should be made and what those changes should be; (2) The barriers schools and districts have to offering all of the graduation pathways and recommendations to eliminate or reduce those barriers for school districts; (3) Whether all students have equitable access to all of the graduation pathways and, if not, recommendations for reducing the barriers students may have to accessing all of the graduation pathways; and (4) Whether additional graduation pathways should be included and recommendations for what those pathways should be.

An instructional tool called Symperiod Board Game) The study was designed and developed, containing 20 test items distributed in three different levels in order of complexity from simple to complex. The between-group experimental research design was adopted for this study in which 20 Form IV students distributed into four groups was selected. The alpha value 0.830 of the Pearson correlation coefficient determines the strength of the instrument's reliability, hence used for data collection. The data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the results indicated that the cognitive development of the respondents' increases as students play the instructional game from level 1 to 3. Thus, the study reveals that a learner cannot understand a concept if he/she does not first remember it; similarly, he/she cannot apply knowledge and concepts if he/she does not understand them. It is imperative to conclude that the poor performance of students in chemistry can be associated with the quality of instruction provided by the teacher during classroom instructions.",

Textbook reviews were carried out by teachers (22 female and 54 male) teaching classes IX to XII in the form of clustered workshops using the Blumberg model of textbook analysis which was employed to analyse gender biases in Vietnamese primary school textbooks. The findings revealed a presence of imbalance of gender among the authors, reviewers, editors and designer as well as the presence of gender biases, gender stereotyping in the content, illustrations and student activity.

Understanding how connections form in university classes and their effects on learning outcomes may provide extraordinary knowledge for researchers, educators, and policy-makers. This paper collected data from the questionnaire survey and then processed them with Gephi software to produce visualization and measurement. Initial results seem to indicate a significant correlation between students' connectedness and academic performance in one class. However, in another class, the results show a contrasting situation as there is no evidence that social network attributes impact learning performance. Taken together, these results would seem to suggest that the characteristics of the network should be judged on a case-by-case basis, and large-scale SNA analyses have been rarely reported. This present study provides a springboard for a new way to shed some light on classmates' interconnection. Using a similar approach to this article, it is believed that there is ample opportunity to study the association between classmate connectedness and career success. Research techniques and approaches around Social Network Analysis are expected to evolve further in the foreseeable future.",

        "description":"The US Supreme Court will hear arguments next month about whether President Biden has the authority to forgive up to $20,000 in student debt for millions of borrowers. Part of the Biden administration's legal argument rests on the claim that borrowers as a group were made worse off financially by the pandemic. Urban Institute's analysis indicates that most borrowers are currently in a similar or stronger financial position than they were in 2019, but there are warning signs that many borrowers will be in a weaker position once the payment pause ends. Key findings from this report include: (1) Most borrowers said they were doing at least as well financially in 2021 as they were before the pandemic; (2) Credit records also show financial improvement; and (3) The role of the payment pause is unclear, as is what will happen when payments resume.",

Slovin's formula was used to identify the respondents with a stratified random sampling technique to generate the required sample size of the study. The results revealed that the level of academic stress in times of the COVID-19 pandemic is high. It is also revealed that there is no significant difference in the level of academic stress when respondents are grouped according to sex, year level, and the number of hours spent for modular learning per day and provided significant difference when grouped according to course. Demographic profiles show that most of the students belong to the poor classification of monthly family income and with a low allowance for internet subscriptions. It also shows that with the intensity of requirements in the course pack, most students allocated many hours to answer the lessons per day. Present findings suggest that the institution must address intervention schemes through academic and non-academic services.",

The purpose of this study was to assess and investigate the effect of T&amp;L preference techniques and technologies chosen by employing ODL in universities during the pandemic. This research adopted a descriptive approach and a quantitative survey was used to collect the necessary data. The questionnaire consisted of 14 questions and was separated into two parts: demographic information and undergraduate students' preference towards online class technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four themes and 16 sub-themes were identified in the set of questions in the survey. The results of the analysis revealed that ODL is the preferred method with WhatsApp social media platform as the medium for communication between educators and learners. Educators might consider devoting additional attention to improving teaching and learning practices in open and distance learning in choosing the right approaches and platform to be used through online and offline classes.",

The transition to the new normal requires adjusting the learning process to prepare students to learn normally. This study aims to describe students' physics learning outcomes using a blended learning model. This research is a type of experimental research. The research design was pre-experimental with the type of intact group comparison, where this type of research divided one class into two treatment groups. The population in this study were 11th-grade students of private madrasah majoring in science in Mataram city. The research sample was 50 students who were divided into two groups. The two groups were given a different treatment, where group 1 was taught with a blended learning model, while group 2 was taught using an online learning model. The physics learning outcome data were obtained through the initial and final tests, which were then analyzed descriptively using the N-gain test to determine the achievement of the learning process. Based on the research that has been done, it is found that the group taught with the blended learning model has a mean value of 70.14 with an N-gain of 0.36 (included in the medium category), which indicates that the use of blended models can be used to adjust students during a period of transition to a new normal. The use of the blended learning model in the learning process is to accustom students to return to normal learning, namely face to face in madrasah. It was done to increase student motivation to learn during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "author":["Kersten, Kristin"],
        "description":"Theoretical approaches within the cognitive-interactionist framework (Long, 2015) have identified various aspects of L2 input and characteristics of instruction that predict learners' L2 outcomes. Such strategies of L2 teaching relate to shaping characteristics of communicative activities in which the L2 is embedded and modifying L2 input, L2 interactions and learners' L2 output. These strategies are in line with task-based and content-based teaching approaches. This article starts out with theoretical underpinnings to L2 instructional principles. It introduces the roles of sensory input and individual perception, internal knowledge construction, prior knowledge, and selective attention as understood within this framework. Consequences of this type of processing for instruction are discussed with respect to the instigation of noticing, salience, cognitive activation, learning from insight and depth of processing. The second part gives an overview of characteristics of teachers' linguistic behaviour, which includes how teachers modify verbal and non-verbal L2 input, shape communicative activities and interactions in terms of authenticity, negotiation of meaning, feedback and focus on form, and create opportunities for learners' L2 output. The goal of these strategies of L2 teaching is to provide comprehensibility and cognitive stimulation during the L2 acquisition process, induce wide-spread neural activity, and facilitate long-term retention. All of these strategies are exemplified by, and operationalised in, the Teacher Input Observation Scheme (TIOS, Kersten, Bruhn, Ponto, Böhnke, &amp; Greve, 2018), which provides a systematic basis for empirical L2 classroom observation, teacher training and teachers' self-evaluation. The article closes with empirical and practical examples of the effects of L2 instructional strategies in pre-school and primary school.",

In the study, data were collected by interview technique and a semi-structured interview form designed by taking expert opinions was applied. According to the research findings, school principals consider themselves primarily responsible for student safety at school. They are aware of the need to ensure the safety of children who are sent to school for education in all aspects (psychological, social, physical) before education. While this awareness leads school principals to take precautions, they are concerned that students may be adversely affected by dangers that develop outside of what they can do and control.",

In addition to experiencing the pandemic disruption in high schools, students were also likely aware of disruptions in colleges and in the labor market. Fast-forward to the spring of 2023. The students who are now graduating from high school are those who started high school shortly before the pandemic began to significantly affect the U.S. The pandemic was a defining aspect of their high school journey, leading to many circumstances that made these students' high school years different from those of other graduating classes. To understand how the pandemic affected students' thoughts about their college and career choices, the authors surveyed a random sample of 12th-grade students in September 2022. As part of a broader survey on the college and career preparation of students from the class of 2023, the authors asked students to indicate which, if any, of the thoughts they had about college and career choices were affected by the pandemic. As a follow-up, the authors also included an open-ended question asking for more details on how the pandemic affected these thoughts. In this brief, the authors share what they learned from 1,549 high school students from the class of 2023.",

It was found that peer bullying was against lower grades in both levels, there was a school uniform application in all schools, the success factor was considered sufficient, and both levels had two school administrators. It was concluded that situations such as phone addiction and smoking were more common in high school. Chronic absenteeism was rare at both levels. In addition, most school administrators stated that they did not have a communication problem with teachers. It was suggested that the interview form created could be used before guidance studies and could be applied in different regions.",

This report, however, focuses on two different questions: (1) Where do school revenues come from?; and (2) How does revenue composition affect education policymaking? Put differently, this report focuses on the degree to which states rely on state versus local revenue, or on different types of taxes (e.g., those on income, sales, or property), and how such features matter for the adequacy and equity of education spending. Two states with identical finance systems and student populations, and which spend the same amount overall on K-12 schools, might have very different adequacy and equity outcomes depending on the composition of their revenue.

However, faced with a national teacher shortage, schools across the country are struggling to hire a workforce of qualified educators that reflects the racial diversity of their communities (Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, &amp; Carver-Thomas, 2016). While conditions in many states have contributed to shortages of teachers of all types, teachers of color encounter unique barriers to entering the profession and continuing to teach for the long haul. Fortunately, a variety of programs, policies, and practices hold promise for helping to bolster the pipeline of teachers of color. This is a summary of a literature review seeks to help readers better understand the research showing the systemic barriers interrupting or blocking pathways into teaching for persons of color and how state and local education agencies can engage certain research-based strategies to overcome those barriers.

It determined the academic performance of the students according to content knowledge, quality of the artwork, and communication skills; and determined what group of learners benefited most from using 3D instructional models. It involved 30 second-year high school students in a private school in Imus, Cavite. Data were treated statistically with arithmetic mean, dependent t-test, gain scores, Pearson r Product Moment of Correlation, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), F-test, and Tukey multiple comparison test. Findings revealed that the use of 3D instructional cell models was effective in improving the academic performance of the students in terms of content knowledge, quality of the artwork, and communication skills. The computed mean difference of 3.60 and t-value of 10.998 for 29 degrees of freedom, which is 2.756 at a 0.01 level of confidence, showed a significant difference from their pre-test and post-test scores. This implies that participants obtained much learning on cellular diversity using 3D cell models. All groups of learners benefited most from using 3D instructional cell models thus students' academic performance in Biology has improved. Thus, the study recommends that 3D instructional models should be used in teaching professional science subjects such as Biology. More so, similar studies should also be conducted not only in Biology subject but also in Chemistry and Physics courses. Other 3D Model Biological Systems can be used for instruction to senior high school science majors and college students.",

The total numbers of CCPs used correctly both syntactically and semantically in their argumentative essays were counted for the pre-tests and post-tests for both groups. Results of Paired Samples and Independent t-tests suggest that neither of the two teaching sequences was more effective than the other in raising the participants' total instances of CCPs; however, blocking appears to be more effective in boosting the use of prepositions as linking words. Sentence transformation, whether administered in the interleaved or blocked sequence, was considered to have served the teaching purpose of providing an opportunity for the students to engage in serious thinking about the semantic relationship between two given sentences.

        "description":"Absent a nationwide plan for universal public prekindergarten, states and districts have taken various approaches to increasing access to school-based educational opportunities for their youngest learners. Though some of these programs have focused on making public prekindergarten available to all families, others have targeted families most in need by introducing means-tested programs. Early efforts to expand access to public schooling for preschool-age children, such as the War on Poverty-era federal Head Start program, focused on reaching low-income children. More recently, states and cities have made significant investments in their own public preschool programs, often citing their utility in combatting racial, ethnic, and income-based test score differences that are apparent at school entry. A long-standing debate has weighed the relative merits of targeting limited resources to equalize early educational opportunities versus providing universal programs. But an underexplored distinction between the two approaches is how they might contribute to racial and ethnic school segregation among this country's youngest students. Key findings in this essay include: (1) Black and Hispanic prekindergarten students in means-tested programs experience consistently higher rates of racial isolation and lower rates of exposure to white students relative to their K-12 counterparts than those in open programs; (2) In states with open-enrollment prekindergarten, the proportion of Black prekindergarten students enrolled in racially isolated schools is nearly identical to that of Black first-graders (roughly 46 percent), but in states where prekindergarten is means tested, the proportion of Black preschoolers in racially isolated schools is 6 percentage points higher than that of Black first-graders; (3) Hispanic preschool students are 5 percentage points more likely than their first-grade counterparts to attend racially isolated schools in states with means-tested prekindergarten and are 3 percentage points less likely than first-grade students to do so in states where prekindergarten is open; and (4) In comparing states with diverse and robust prekindergarten programs, the data show that Black and Hispanic prekindergarten students in Texas and North Carolina, which have means-tested programs, have less exposure to white students than their counterparts in Georgia and Oklahoma, which have universal enrollment.",

        "description":"To support English learners (ELs), schools across the US have been providing programs and services to ELs, such as English language development instructions and bilingual education (Umansky &amp; Porter, 2020). However, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant changes to education, including the abrupt transition to online learning. Several studies have found declines in ELs' academic performance and English language proficiency performance, and, in some cases, these declines were disproportionately larger compared to other students (Lazarin, 2022). To understand why their performance declined, it is important to first find out whether the pandemic disrupted the programs and services that ELs received in school. In 2002, ACT surveyed EL students who took the ACT® test in February or April 2022 to learn about their experiences and perceptions of instruction and testing supports at school. This data byte focuses on survey responses to questions about the programs and services they received at school during the pandemic.

        "description":"The Utah State Board of Education (USBE) released a Request for Proposals (RFP) during the summer of 2021 for a firm to support the redesign of Utah's School Accountability System so that it's more aligned with Personalized, Competency-Based Learning and Utah's Portrait of a Graduate, but still simple and transparent. The current Utah School Accountability System was established through S.B. 220 during the 2017 legislative session, prior to the Personalized, Competency-Based Learning and Portrait of a Graduate initiatives. The Utah State Board of Education (USBE) wanted to reexamine the theory of action that underpins Utah's school accountability system. In addition, the pandemic highlighted the shortcomings of a state accountability system's heavy reliance on state assessment results. Given these dynamics, USBE wanted to engage stakeholders to examine and recommend a redesigned school accountability system inclusive of the additional initiatives; be more comprehensive in its evaluation criteria; and support continuous school improvement in all schools. The report presents recommendations for the redesign of Utah's School Accountability System. The overarching goal of the redesign process was to create a system that supports schools in implementing a Personalized and Competency Based learning system and facilitating student achievement of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions represented by Utah's Portrait of a Graduate. Another key goal was to make the system as simple and transparent as possible while recognizing that evaluating school quality is a complex endeavor. The recommendations stem from the Accountability Redesign Advisory Committee as well as from broad-based community input. The Advisory Committee engaged in almost a year-long deliberative process working through the development of a detailed theory of action, articulating clear principles to guide the selection of indicators and the system design, and offering policy recommendations to support the proposed system design. The 29 Advisory Committee members represented school and local education agency (LEA) leaders, LEA assessment directors, teachers, and parents. The Advisory Committee is composed of members from the following stakeholder groups: Assessment Directors, Teachers, LEA Specialists (Growth, Special Education, DTL, ALS, Ed Tech), Executive Directors, Superintendents, Assistant Superintendents, Local Board, principals, and Parents.",

Results suggest that there is indeed an inverse relationship between resting heart rate and the affective traits of psychopathy (Uncaring, Callousness, and Unemotionality) as well as Thrill or Sensation Seeking in males.

        "description":"Children's literacy development begins long before formal schooling, with parents and the home environment exerting important influences on the development of their children's language skills. A focus on the early years and the home learning environment of children is therefore crucial to ensure that they get the best possible foundation for their literacy skills. There is some research has shown that the pandemic and associated lockdowns have led to an increase in home learning activities (e.g. Davies et al., 2021). However it also has shown that, overall, parents engaged in fewer home learning activities in 2021 compared with the two previous years. There have likely been various reasons for changes in the home learning environment during the pandemic. Indeed, it's not far-fetched to consider the increased isolation and lack of contact and support from others leading to insecurity for parents when it comes to supporting their child in the home. With these pressures, developing a home learning environment may be of less priority to a parent. Alternatively, rather than not being a priority, some parents may have lacked the resources or time to consider alternatives to early learning engagement. Finally, stress and anxiety surrounding the pandemic may have prevented parents from engaging in activity as normal. This report synthesises information from the following sources to provide insight into the importance of the home learning environment and early language skills: (1) Existing literature; (2) Survey data of parents the National Literacy Trust commissioned from One Poll in 2019 (n = 2,000) and 2020 (n = 2,000), and Savanta ComRes in 2021 (n = 1,562); (3) Insight from the 2015 and 2021/2 evaluation of our Early Words Together programme.

While some staffing design efforts accomplish one or two of these goals, the most innovative staffing models accomplish all of them, within regular budgets.

The pandemic has exacerbated the literacy challenge. Despite the huge achievements of the education and library sectors in supporting children's reading throughout periods of school closures, it is now apparent that the disruption caused by the pandemic has influenced children's literacy in a number of ways: (1) children from disadvantaged communities have fallen furthest behind; (2) school readiness has suffered and more children are starting school with speech and language delay; and (3) the early language development of babies and toddlers from disadvantaged communities has been particularly impacted by temporary library closures. The report highlights evidence that, despite the huge achievements of teachers and librarians in supporting pupils through periods of school closures, the pandemic has exacerbated the literacy gap between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers.

        "description":"From 2016 to 2021, the Better Math Teaching Network (BMTN) aimed to transform high school mathematics teaching in New England. Researchers and teachers worked together to make high school Algebra I classes more student centered. Network leaders organized the BMTN as a networked improvement community (NIC) to address a common problem of practice using improvement science. The BMTN was piloted with a group of nine teachers during the 2015-2016 school year and added teachers the following three years. In all, a total of 63 teachers engaged in the BMTN. Selected from a pool of volunteers that applied to join the network, participating teachers worked in urban, suburban, and rural contexts and taught at least one Algebra I course to 9th grade students. They engaged collaboratively to continuously improve their teaching, enhancing learning for thousands of high school math students throughout New England. This report is a developmental evaluation that studied and supported the networked improvement community's (NIC) initiation, development, outcomes, and dissemination of lessons learned. The developmental evaluation of BMTN aimed to: (1) infuse an evidence-based critical friend/thought partner perspective into the network development process; (2) track growth and the development of the NIC as a learning organization; (3) produce useable knowledge for the education field and specifically for other educators, policymakers, funders, and researchers interested in the NIC model as a way to organize for improvement and address high-leverage practical problems; and (4) advance the evaluation field by testing and refining models for evaluating improvement processes and NICs in education contexts.",

In 2019, all 25 MCPS comprehensive high schools offered AP courses and 8 high schools provided IB programs. Districtwide, more than 56.0 percent of MCPS high school students enrolled in at least one AP or IB course in 2019. In the past three years, the rate of AP/IB course enrollment increased 6.8 percentage points. The continued emphasis on rigorous course-taking resulted in 41,048 AP exams taken by MCPS students in 2019 and 29,334 of those tests had a score of 3 or higher. The percentage of AP exams taken by MCPS students who attained scores of 3 or higher (71.5 percent) was 4.7 and 13.6 percentage points higher than those for public school students in the state of Maryland (66.8 percent) and the nation (57.9 percent), respectively. The number of IB exams taken by MCPS students decreased from 3,770 in 2017 to 3,587 in 2019.",

In this memo, the results of 2021 students were compared with those of 2019 students. It is important to note that 2019 students had in-person schooling but 2021 students experienced virtual learning. Additionally, 2021 students were allowed to reduce their course load due to challenges of learning during the pandemic. It is prudent to recognize the differences of 2019 and 2021 student cohorts when a comparison of the data is made. The College Board shifted their testing procedures in the 2019-2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and they continued in the 2020-2021 school year. The number of AP exams taken by high school students was 31,750 in 2021, a decrease of 9,298 tests from 2019. The percent of AP exams taken by students with a score of 3 or higher was 68.1 in 2021, a 3.4 percentage-point decrease from 2019. MCPS students decreased participation in the number of IB exams from 3,587 in 2019 to 3,084 in 2021. [For the 2019 report, see ED627127.]",

The College Board shifted their testing procedures in 2019-2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, emergency remote learning, problems with access to technology, and reductions in course load for some students may have had unintended consequences on students' enrollment in AP/IB courses and participation in exams. Students returned to in-person testing in 2021-2022 school year because schools were open. In 2022, all 25 comprehensive high schools offered AP courses, and eight offered IB programs. From 2020 to 2022, the AP/IB course enrollment rate decreased by 9.3%. The enrollment rate decreased by 5.2% from 2021 to 2022. Some equity gaps expanded during and in the wake of emergency remote learning due to the pandemic. The number of AP exams taken by high school students was 33,291 in 2022, a decrease of 5,963 tests from 2020 but an increase of 1,541 tests from 2021. The percent of AP exams taken by students with a score of 3 or higher was 72.4 in 2022, a 2.7 percentage-point decrease from 75.1 in 2020 but a 4.3 percentage-point increase from 68.1 in 2021. Participation in IB exams decreased from 3,688 in 2020 to 3,084 in 2021 and 2,992 in 2022. The percentage of IB exams taken by students with a score of 4 or higher was 82.5% in 2022, an increase of 1.4% from 81.1% in 2020 but a decrease of 4.5% from 87% in 2021.

Without question, accelerating equity in programming has long been a priority of EFNEP. Historically underserved populations with limited financial resources are often people of color and at increased risk for diet-related diseases. EFNEP contributes to nutrition security as program families and youths gained knowledge and skills for healthier food and physical activity choices, increased food resource management (shopping and food preparation), food safety, and improved food security practices to keep healthy in challenging times. Consistent with previous years, adult and youth participants in FY 2022 reported improved behaviors following program involvement. More than 90% of adult EFNEP participants reported improvement in what they ate. National EFNEP priorities for FY 2022 included facilitating workforce development, increasing program reach, and increasing appropriate use of technology in teaching. This report reflects how EFNEP continues to make a difference in the lives of low-income families and youths, even and especially in times of adversity. [For the 2021 report, see ED623567.]",

Using reading and math assessment data from a sample of 8 million students in grades 3-8 in 24,000 public schools who took MAP Growth assessments in spring 2022 and a similar sized sample from before the pandemic, we examined the degree to which test scores became more variable. To understand how impacts may have differed for students with the highest and lowest test scores before the pandemic, we followed a subset of 1 million students whose pre-pandemic achievement placed them in the top or bottom decile of the achievement distribution relative to national pre-pandemic norms. Initial findings show students have a wider range of achievement levels in spring 2022 than would be expected in a typical school year, and that this increased variability in test scores is primarily driven by a spreading out at the bottom end of the distribution, with test scores for lower-achieving students dropping more than the declines observed for higher-achieving students. Low achievers experienced larger initial impacts at the onset of the pandemic and less improvement during 2021-22. These results highlight a key challenge for teachers who must now meet the needs of students who may be in the same grade but differ even more than they did prior to the pandemic in terms of learning needs, and suggest a critical need for focusing support to help the lowest achieving students catch up to address the achievement divide that has widened significantly over the last two years.

        "description":"A series of course-specific MAP Growth Mathematics and Science subject tests were released successively starting in August 2017 to replace the older NWEA End-of-Course (EOC) tests. Different from the prior NWEA EOC tests taken only at the end of a course, these course-specific tests can be administered multiple times throughout the school year, typically in the fall, winter, and spring, allowing for student growth to be evaluated in a content area over the duration of a course. This report documents the procedure used to produce the achievement and growth user norms for a series of the course-specific MAP® Growth™ subject tests, including Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, Integrated Math I, Integrated Math II, Integrated Math III, and Biology/Life Science. Among these tests, Integrated Math I, Integrated Math II, Integrated Math III, and Biology/Life Science were the first time to have their norms available. For both achievement and growth norms, the percentile ranks corresponding to a student's achievement and observed academic growth between terms relative to their academic peers were developed. The percentile rank is a normative statistic that indicates how well a student performed or grew in comparison to their peers in the norm group. The achievement norms cover three terms (fall, winter, and spring), and the growth norms cover fall-to-winter, winter-to-spring, and fall-to-spring growth.",

The project is designed to strengthen community college transfer pathways in four humanities fields--communication, English, history, and theater--by identifying and using promising strategies to connect community college students to programs of study in these areas and by increasing coordination and curricular alignment between two- and four-year institutions. The authors analyze state administrative data collected by the Michigan Education Data Center to present statistics and trends in community college student course enrollments, transfer, and bachelor's degree completion in a wide array of humanities fields, including the four Strengthening MiHumanities disciplines, and the liberal arts. They also summarize findings from interviews with faculty, staff, and students to highlight promising approaches to strengthening humanities transfer outcomes.

        "description":"While the ongoing academic impacts of the COVID pandemic in grades 3-8 has been well documented, far less is known about its effects on students who were in pre-K or kindergarten when the pandemic started in March 2020. In this brief, we focus on students who were in first and second grade in the 2021-22 school year, and for whom the majority of school experiences have occurred since the onset of the pandemic. Using MAP Growth data from 1.6 million students in grades 1-2 who took assessments in reading and math in approximately 11,000 public schools in 2021-22 and a roughly equivalent sample of students who tested in those same grades in 2018-19, we found that reading and math achievement in first and second grade remains substantially lower in spring 2022 relative to historical data, especially for historically marginalized and economically disadvantaged students. While second-grade to fifth-grade students showed mostly parallel growth trends in 2021-22 relative to a pre-pandemic year, students in first grade, who have only experienced pandemic schooling, showed 6-7% lower growth. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the impact of the pandemic is not limited to the students for whom &quot;normal&quot; was turned on its head following the onset of COVID-19. Even students who have only ever known schooling during the pandemic era have been impacted. These results highlight the need for targeted investments in early literacy and math programs to ensure that our youngest students can develop these essential skills.",

On the Dashboard the indicators are compiled into an Average Opportunity Score and into three indexes of educational opportunity: (1) Access to Quality Educators Index; (2) Access to a Positive School Climate Index; and (3) Access to a College/Career Readiness Curriculum Index. This report provides a high-level discussion of educational opportunity and inequity at the national level as found on the Dashboard. Key findings include: (1) Black and Hispanic students had less access compared to White and Asian students on all three indexes of educational opportunity; (2) Students eligible for Free/Reduced-Price Lunch (FRPL) had less access to educational opportunities compared to students not eligible for FRPL on all three indexes; (3) The concentration of Black and Hispanic students in high-poverty schools appears to be a primary factor driving gaps in access to educational opportunity; however, racial disparities often exist even within levels of school poverty. For example (a) Within low-, mid-, and high-poverty schools, Black students had less access to quality educators compared to White students and less access to a positive school climate; and (b) Hispanic students had less access to quality educators compared to White students across every level of school poverty; and (4) Inequities by race/ethnicity and student income are found in both primary and secondary schools, with larger gaps in secondary schools.",

However, the pandemic created numerous challenges for home visiting programs, forcing them to deliver services online or in a hybrid format and to adapt the content of their program models to respond to pandemic-related challenges. Questions remain about the impacts of these programs when delivered at scale during this uniquely challenging time. The current study reports 12-month impacts from a randomized controlled trial of Child First--an evidence-based home visiting program that provides a psychotherapeutic, parent-child intervention embedded in a coordinated system of care--implemented across two states. After randomly assigning a racially and ethnically diverse sample of families (N = 226) from predominantly low-income backgrounds to receive the Child First services or typical community services, the research team surveyed caregivers (N = 183) about a year after program enrollment. Results from regression models with site fixed effects revealed that Child First reduced caregivers' job losses, residential mobility, and self-reported substance abuse, and increased receipt of virtual services during the pandemic. Child First also reduced parenting dysfunction (the name of the subscale within the Parenting Stress Index) among caregivers who reported clinical depression at enrollment. There were null impacts on caregivers' psychological well-being, families' involvement with the child welfare system, children's behaviors, and other indicators of economic well-being. Implications for future research and policy are discussed.",

Our multi-year evaluation sought to understand the affordances and constraints of each strategy. In the sections below, we present the five strategies that reflect this developmental trajectory. We begin by providing examples of each strategy. We then identify the resources necessary for implementation and reflect on the affordances and constraints of the strategy. To understand the possibilities for scaling the learning of the BMTN--and other improvement networks--we analyze each strategy using Coburn's four dimensions of scale: widespread use, depth of implementation, shift in reform ownership, and sustainability.",

        "description":"From the fall of 2017 to the winter of 2020, the Student-Centered Assessment Network (SCAN) aimed to transform high school teaching in Rhode Island. Researchers and teachers worked together to make high school classes more student centered by increasing teachers' use of student-centered formative assessment. Network leaders (the hub) organized SCAN as an improvement network to address a shared problem of practice using improvement science. By joining the network, SCAN teachers committed to working collaboratively to make their formative assessment practice more student centered, using iterative testing cycles--Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles--to hone their instructional practices. SCAN was launched with a group of 23 high school teachers during the 2017-2018 school year. New teachers joined in the fall of 2018 and in the fall of 2019. The network was made up of educators from three public high schools that served a wide range of student demographics. In all, a total of 59 teachers representing seven content areas participated in SCAN. They engaged collaboratively to continuously improve their teaching, enhancing learning for thousands of Rhode Island high school students. This developmental evaluation of SCAN aims to: (1) infuse an evidence-based critical friend/thought partner perspective into the network development process; (2) track growth and the development of the Networked Improvement Community (NIC) as a learning organization; (3) produce useable knowledge for the education field and specifically for other educators, policymakers, funders, and researchers interested in the NIC model as a way to organize for improvement and address high-leverage practical problems; and (4) advance the evaluation field by testing and refining models for evaluating improvement processes and NICs in education contexts.",

        "description":"Chemistry includes observable phenomena and materials related to daily life, but learners sometimes have difficulties understanding the theoretical and abstract nature of chemistry as well as its applications and relating it to everyday experiences. In this manner, the aim of the study is to determine and assess whether pre-service science and pre-service chemistry teachers could relate the experiments conducted in the chemistry laboratory to daily life or not. The research is designed as a case study and the study group consists of pre-service science (n=18) and chemistry teachers (n=18) who are studying at a state university in Istanbul. Research data is collected with open-ended questions in accordance with the general chemistry laboratory I course content. The questions aimed to investigate the conceptual understanding and the views of pre-service teachers. The results showed that the participants could not adequately make the conceptual explanations, however, they were able to establish the connection with daily life. Also, the pre-service teachers stated that they did not have any difficulties integrating chemistry with daily life in the interviews. In light of the findings, some implications were drawn to establish a relationship between the content and laboratory courses and daily lives to make more meaningful learning.",

        "description":"Since the 1990's, the federal government has allocated funds to Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to through the Title V, Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions program. However, this program has become increasingly competitive such that less than half (40 percent) of all eligible HSIs received Title V funds in 2020. The competitive nature of HSI federal funding has increased the importance for HSIs to plan effectively for grant competitions and utilize funds in a sustainable manner that supplements existing institutional efforts. The increasingly limited reach of federal funding has raised questions regarding how institutions participate in HSI federal grant programs and the impact these programs have on sustaining institutional practices that facilitate Latino student success. &quot;Excelencia&quot; in Education interviewed six HSIs to understand how these institutions have participated in HSI federal grant competitions, specifically the Title V and HSI STEM grant programs. The institutions shared their current strategies for preparing federal grant applications, how they have leveraged federal funding to advance and sustain institutional efforts, and what it means to them to be an HSI. From the interviews, the HSIs demonstrated strategies that can refine the way policymakers and HSI advocates approach the way they support HSIs. The implications of the institutional practices shared in this brief may inform how other HSIs strategize their own federal grant participation strategies and inform the U.S. Department of Education (ED) in how their grant application and evaluation processes look in practice.",

        "description":"Massachusetts has developed a reputation for being a hub of innovation in science, technology, engineering, and math. Fields like health care and technology are booming here. Yet compared with the general population, the people who fill these roles are disproportionately White. Estimates indicate that between 2018 and 2028, one out of every three jobs created in Massachusetts will be in STEM fields. There are increasing opportunities to work in this growing, lucrative industry. But for whom? Research shows that even though many students with marginalized identities have an intrinsic interest in and capacity for STEM coursework, there is a systemic shortage of support, representation, and resources to help cultivate that interest. This case study looks at how the BoSTEM Initiative is working to fill this gap by coordinating a system of high-quality out-of-school-time STEM learning opportunities for middle school students through collaboration with out-of-school-time programs, Boston Public Schools educators, and local STEM industry partners. The report delves into the data to track its progress over the past few years, its potential for continued impact, and how it can be used as a replicable model for communities in other regions.

        "description":"Massachusetts has received $2.9 billion in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funding, with the vast majority going to districts. Across the state, almost all of the first round of funding (ESSER I) and the majority of the second round (ESSER II) has been spent. Districts now have until September 2024 to spend the remainder of the third round of funding (ESSER III). How is this money being used? And what challenges do districts face in spending such a large amount of money effectively? To find out, our EdImpact Research Consortium created a Data Dashboard to track and analyze spending in 24 key districts. But the numbers alone don't tell the whole story. To dig deeper into the successes and challenges districts have faced in allocating ESSER funding, we also produced this case study that takes a closer look at what this process looks like for Holyoke Public Schools, New Bedford Public Schools, Revere Public Schools, and Worcester Public Schools. Through data analysis and interviews with district staff, this case study explores these districts' journeys to address students' lost learning time, the ways they have chosen to use funds, and some of the most expensive items in their ESSER plans.

        "description":"Pennsylvania has &quot;the highest cyber charter school enrollment in the country&quot; with student enrollment soaring in 2020-21 due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. School districts paid over $1 billion in tuition for students enrolled in Pennsylvania's 14 cyber charter schools in 2020-21, a $335 million increase over the prior school year. Districts now cite charter school tuition as their top budget pressure. In a 2017 study, Research for Action found that districts are unable to realize substantial savings when students depart for charter schools, leaving the vast majority of tuition as a &quot;stranded cost&quot; or negative fiscal impact on district finances. Here we apply the findings of that study to estimate the fiscal impact of the expansion of cyber charter schools attributable to the pandemic. We find that year-one stranded costs ranged from $290 to $308 million dollars statewide, highlighting the need for policymakers to address the inefficient spending on cyber charter schools in current law. We also describe the broader context of cyber charter schools in Pennsylvania.",

Using a high-quality theory-based measure, we assessed several student learning and development outcomes (e.g., institutional commitment, academic self-efficacy) that theory and research indicated are necessary for students to achieve academic success. Based on the outcomes assessment results, we identified which aspects of the program seemed to be working and which aspects needed improvement.

        "description":"Student affairs educators are asked fundamental questions about programming and its effectiveness. Stakeholders (e.g., students, parents, accreditors) ask what programming (e.g., activities, strategies, curriculum) is offered, &quot;why&quot; it is offered, and &quot;who&quot; benefits in terms of learning and development (e.g., Carpenter, 2001; US Department of Education, 2006). Given these questions are typical and expected, I illustrate how outcomes assessment can be represented as a process of answering common and pertinent questions that matter in higher education. In turn, the assessment process is presented as a valued activity to student affairs educators, not something novel or an add-on. Moreover, a question-answering approach has been shown to be less controlling than direct appeals (Walton &amp; Wilson, 2018), prompting subsequent task engagement (Wood et al., 2016). Therefore, processing assessment-related questions should prompt engagement in outcomes assessment.",

        "author":["Wolfgram, Matthew"],
        "description":"The paper introduces the history and politics of value formation at historically Black colleges/universities (HBCUs) and focuses on how cultural-institutional values associated with Black and minority servingness--such as Black empowerment, ethics of care, and community service--impact the work of educators to coordinate internship opportunities for students. Drawing on interviews with educators at six HBCUs (n=27), this paper documents how such cultural-institutional values impact educational labor by being manifested in institutional discourse, supported through provision of institutional resources, embodied through institutional practices, and measured and assessed though institutional regimes of accountability. Educators work to expand students' access to the market by courting employers to establish networks for internships, and at the same time, work to promote the good reputation of the HBCU by selecting and triaging students who will represent the institution well, by socializing particular social skills, work norms, and dispositions of respectability, and by sociocultural matching of student and employer. This approach creates and expands the internship market for HBCU students; provides students with extra care, advice, and anticipatory socialization for the internship; and matches the student with an employer who may be particularly amenable to supporting the student's development. The paper proposes a value theory of educational labor that highlights and clarifies how cultural-institutional values constitute a specific context that motivates educators' work to serve their students in particular culturally informed ways.",

We argue MTSS-B must prioritize racial equity and healing in schools. We first discuss how discipline has centered Whiteness, providing a brief history of relevant events and sociopolitical forces that have maintained a reliance on exclusionary discipline practices with a primary focus on out-of-school suspension to oppress youth of color, specifically Black students. Then, we describe the harm exclusionary discipline has caused the Black community by synthesizing counter-storytelling. Finally, we propose ways to strengthen MTSS-B to promote racial equity with a primary focus on supports to adults in the systems in which oppression is maintained. We propose school psychologists can: (1) empower students, families, and communities to engage in authentic partnerships; (2) advocate to educational leaders; (3) coordinate transformative staff professional development; and (4) support teachers to create inclusive and healing classroom communities. We frame these suggestions within an ecological-behavioral paradigm that considers root conditions of harm. [This paper will be published in &quot;School Psychology Review.&quot;]",

        "description":"English Learners (ELs) are students from whom much is expected: they are tasked with mastering grade-level content while also learning English, a language in which they are not fully proficient. Mastering academic English--the set of language skills necessary for success in school--is a developmental process that takes at least five to seven years. Over time, most students who begin school classified as ELs demonstrate English proficiency and their status changes from that of an active EL to a former EL. Because of this, active ELs are concentrated in the early grades. Hence, schools and teachers need to focus educational resources in the early years to support ELs' instructional needs and set them on a path to academic success. To provide new and needed knowledge about what student and school characteristics are associated with EL success in pre-k and the early grades, this study examines attendance, grades, test scores, and English proficiency from two groups of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) ELs (14,058 students in pre-k and 16,651 students in the early grades K-3) to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the factors associated with stronger outcomes for ELs in pre-k and the early grades?; (2) To what extent can schools identify ELs who would benefit from additional support?",

        "description":"In 1994, the Midwestern Higher Education Compact (MHEC) joined its sister compacts in offering a regional student reciprocity and tuition exchange opportunity known as the Midwest Student Exchange Program (MSEP). The program allowed students from one MHEC state to attend an institution at a reduced tuition rate in another MHEC state when the student's home state did not offer the degree program the student was seeking. This arrangement benefitted students, families, institutions, and states by increasing options and decreasing costs for families and students while increasing enrollments and student in-migration at participating schools in MSEP states. This report begins with an overview of current trends in higher education and moves to a discussion of the contemporary role of student exchange and tuition reciprocity programs. These sections are followed by a 25-year history of MSEP, placing MSEP in context vis-à-vis other reciprocity programs, its original goals, and the contemporary needs and priorities of students, families, institutions, and states.",

The first section provides a definition of through-year assessment, the main motivations and purposes for through-year assessments, and the tools for specifying an assessment design, including theories of action, claims, and validity arguments. The second section describes key design aspects that every through-year assessment program must address, and some options for those design aspects that distinguish through-year models. The third section discusses emerging examples of specific through-year assessment designs in terms of their design choices, challenges, and trade-offs. The fourth section provides suggestions for evaluating through-year assessment programs that go beyond current evaluation requirements for state summative assessments, such as federal Peer Review. The fifth and final section provides conclusions and a view to the future.",

As state educational agencies (SEAs) weigh the advantages and disadvantages of embracing this emergent assessment system, it is important to consider the impact such a decision would have on local educational agencies (LEAs). This paper explores the practical considerations for LEAs managing the implementation of a statewide through-year model with an instructional use additional aim. It outlines the work required at the LEA level to effectively implement a through-year approach, including defining a theory of action, developing a plan for supporting teachers and students, communicating with key stakeholders, and administration management. Importantly, the paper also addresses potential implications of a through-year assessment model at the classroom level through teacher and student vignettes. It aims to answer the question: How might a through-year assessment system more effectively serve the primary purpose of assessment: improving teaching and instruction?

Given this potential that choice has to enhance instruction, it is reasonable to examine its potential as a contributor to enhanced assessment practices. The goal of this brief is to provide state and district education leaders and educators with some considerations about the possibilities and challenges in providing choice in assessment. It is organized into five sections: (1) Introduction; (2) Types of choice in assessment; (3) Choice in assessment: Goals and challenges; (4) Conclusions; and (5) Recommendations for education agencies and educators.",

        "description":"Over the past few years, several states have begun to explore or pilot different through-year assessments to serve as replacements to the traditional end-of-year summative assessments that are currently the predominant source of information used by states to meet federal accountability requirements. While there are several different assessment models that could be considered as part of a through-year design, the purpose of this paper is to examine what it might look like to administer the end-of-year computer adaptive test (CAT) in a through-year model that more closely resembles the current Smarter Balanced interim assessment blocks (IABs), with a specific emphasis on content considerations. It is guided by the following two questions: (1) To what degree do some of the most widely used mathematics and English language arts/literacy curricula support a reasonable structure for clustering standards for a through-year model? and (2) To what degree can the existing Smarter Balanced interim assessment system, with some adaptations, be used to support the design and development of a high-quality through-year assessment model?",

This paper uses a &quot;design narrative&quot; method to describe how leaders orchestrated organizational change by bringing diverse communities together into research-practice partnerships. The narrative uses the idea of &quot;boundary objects&quot; to describe how initiatives were progressively developed to create more inclusive spaces for sustained innovation. The insights and the capacity that resulted from initial design efforts created a richer space for subsequent initiatives. The paper shows how design narratives can illustrate the role that boundary objects can play in organizational change and concludes with a discussion of the role that leaders can play in creating inclusive cultures of innovation in higher education.",

One experimental design that is well suited in a social distancing research context is the single-case experimental design (SCD). SCDs can handle disruptions as: (a) they do not require large groups gathering for data collection or intervention administration; (b) interventions are administered individually and in some cases remotely; (c) no comparison group is needed; and (d) they are adaptive and flexible designs. The purpose of this article is to introduce the mobile application, SCD-MVA (2019), developed to assists in the design of an SCD, data gathering, data analysis, and remote collaboration. The application allows data management and data sharing among researchers, provides an in real time visualization of the gathered data, stimulates interaction between researchers in terms of designing the SCD, gathering the data, and analyzing the gathered data, and does all these things with no need for in-person meetings of the research team.

This paper provides an existence proof of this type of assessment and investigates the affordances and constraints of the approach. The study describes three types of mixed-reality simulation-based performance tasks of three core practices. More than 400 novices in 64 teacher preparation programs in the United States reported that they were able to use the simulation environment and believed the tasks measure important teaching skills. Scores on the tasks were positively related to novices' prior academic and teacher education experiences. Implications for the formative use of such simulations are discussed.",

It also expands on these reports with additional levels of disaggregation and introduces a new experimental measure of students' income background. This new research illustrates how closely postsecondary transfer pathways track students' socioeconomic circumstances before and after the pandemic began. The new series also significantly expands upon &quot;Tracking Transfer&quot; by additionally analyzing more recent cohort years of community college starters beyond those that began 7-8 years earlier. Coming out of the pandemic, it is particularly valuable for understanding how these pandemic-era starting cohorts fared in their early college careers compared to pre-pandemic cohorts. As data accumulates over time, we can also compare baccalaureate degree attainment rates within six years of enrolling for pandemic-affected cohorts. This redesigned and expanded report series aims to better serve the education community with new, timely, and detailed data that are only available through the Clearinghouse. These include, but are not limited to, postsecondary participation, mobility, and progress among economically disadvantaged students, disparities in pandemic recovery across differing student and institutional characteristics, and early success indicators for the recent freshman classes at community colleges, the hardest hit sector of higher education during the pandemic. This series was created with the urgent need for timely information in mind, to help educational leaders and policy makers address enduring enrollment impacts from the pandemic. This first report in the annual Transfer and Progress series covers 11.5 million undergraduate students without a prior bachelor's degree that were enrolled in fall 2022 in a three-year fixed panel of institutions (fall 2020 to 2022), representing approximately 89.0% of the Clearinghouse universe of institutions. Additionally, to establish the pre-pandemic baseline for all newly introduced metrics, an expanded five-year fixed panel of institutions (fall 2018 to fall 2022) was employed, that represents 11 million undergraduates without a prior bachelor's degree and 83.8% of the Clearinghouse universe of institutions.",

        "description":"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radios (NWRs) can be used by education agencies before, during, and after an emergency. The information collected through the NWR may be used to determine which annexes (whether functional or threat- or hazard-specific) should be activated. Furthermore, NWRs may be used to receive information in the event of a power outage, a Wi-Fi outage, or an overloaded mobile phone network. They provide a reliable source of information that will be aligned with information received by local community partners and state-level partners who may support response. This fact sheet is intended for administrators, teachers, faculty, and staff at K-12 schools, school districts, and institutions of higher education (IHEs) to use to prepare to receive emergency notifications. It provides information on the NWR, including key features to look for when purchasing an NWR, where to station NWR receivers on the school campus, where to obtain more information specific to your area, and integration of NWR receivers when practicing the plan.",

        "description":"A wealth of literature shows positive outcomes and experiences from arts learning, yet youth access to arts education has become significantly more inequitable over the past 30 years. Alongside the growing discourse around arts learning and equity issues, there is a recognized and persistent need for more research. We conducted a critical, qualitative study of out-of-school time (OST) arts organizations across the United States. Our primary research questions were: (1) How do community youth arts organizational leaders, teaching artists, and participants describe the leading ideas and practices in OST youth arts programming? (2) How can OST youth arts work center the cultural, historical, and geographic resources that artists and arts organizations bring to arts programming? We first developed a theoretical framework for understanding arts practices in education and summarize key learning outcomes associated with youth participation in the arts. We then talked with OST arts education experts across the United States to understand how their programs support and center youth in arts learning, particularly Black youth, Indigenous youth, and youth of color (BIPOC youth), youth from low-income backgrounds, and LGBTQIA+ youth. This report offers the concept of &quot;cultural-regional scenes&quot; to describe the critical, qualitative case studies we developed of OST youth arts practice. We describe four unique cultural-regional scenes--the Urban Midwest, the Bay Area, Texas-Mexico Border Towns, and the Indigenous Southwest--and provide examples of youth arts practice in each scene. We conclude with ideas that stretch across scenes and suggest that researchers and practitioners can take up this approach in the study of OST youth arts programs.

Because little is known about what happens to students after a closure, this first report is a descriptive analysis of the students who experience a closure and their longitudinal enrollment and credential attainment outcomes after closure. Using an original panel dataset constructed with student-level data from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), this report traces if, when, and through which education pathways affected students reenrolled to continue their education and whether they were successful in earning a credential. Answering these basic questions establishes a foundation for causal estimates and deeper exploration into existing state policies that can adequately protect current and future students from the negative effects of a disrupted postsecondary experience. Report two will include a causal analysis of closures on student outcomes, while report three will incorporate the state authorization policy context to ascertain if policy interventions can ameliorate the negative impacts of closures on students.",

        "description":"This study introduces an innovative meta-analytic approach, two-stage multilevel meta-analysis that considers the hierarchical structure of single-case experimental design (SCED) data. This approach is unique as it is suitable to include moderators at the intervention level, participant level, and study level, and is therefore especially recommended for the meta-analyst interested in moving beyond estimating the overall intervention effectiveness. Using this approach, the between-participant variability and between-study variability in intervention effectiveness can be evaluated in addition to obtaining a generalized effect size estimate across studies. This is a timely contribution to the SCED field, as the source(s) of variability in effect size can be identified, and moderators at the corresponding level(s) (participant level and/or study level) can be added to explain the variability. The two-stage multilevel meta-analytic approach, with the inclusion of moderators, can provide evidence-based recommendations about the effectiveness of an intervention taking into account intervention, participant, and study characteristics. First, a conceptual introduction to two-stage multilevel meta-analysis is given to provide a good understanding of its full potentials and modeling options. Second, the usage of this approach will be demonstrated by applying it to a published meta-analytic data set. The goal of this study is to disseminate the two-stage multilevel meta-analysis approach in the hope that SCED meta-analyst will consider this methodology in future meta-analyses.",

This culminated in the report &quot;Student Reciprocity Programs and MSEP in the 21st Century&quot; (ED627191) which utilized historical MHEC documents, recent publications around student exchange programs, interviews, and surveys. As a result, a set of observations and recommendations have been identified. They included: (1) clarifying MSEP goals; (2) updating and optimizing MSEP policies; (3) improving, expanding, and supporting MSEP data collection; and (4) improving MSEP administration and staffing. This report has a new look and additional data to serve the needs of a wider and more diverse group of compact stakeholders. In 2020-21, students and families in Midwest states saved more than $60 million through MHEC's Midwest Student Exchange Program, which provides more affordable opportunities for students to attend out-of-state institutions and serves as the Midwest's largest multi-state tuition reciprocity program.

The ability to engage young minds is critical for effective teaching and learning. In this paper, we explore various approaches that educators can use to ensure that their lessons are interesting, stimulating, and relevant to their students' needs and interests. We begin by examining the importance of attention in the classroom and the factors that can affect students' ability to focus. We then delve into practical techniques that teachers can use to create engaging lessons, including the use of storytelling, games, and technology. Furthermore, we discuss how incorporating movement and physical activity can help maintain attention and increase engagement. We also look at the importance of creating a positive and supportive classroom environment.",

The FY21 Federal High School Graduation Rate includes standard diplomas but excludes special diplomas and General Education Diplomas (GEDs). Students with Disabilities (SWD) on Access Points curriculum are working to earn a standard diploma and are included as graduates, if successful. It should be noted that due to COVID-19, assessment requirements for graduation were waived for FY20 seniors who had yet to meet them, but were reinstated for FY21 seniors. This fact should be kept in mind when comparing the FY20 graduation rates with other years. In FY21, the District's overall graduation rate was 91.0%. In addition, the District's overall graduation rate exceeded Florida and 5 of the other large urban school districts as well as having the largest single year increase. District-operated high schools exceeded the School Board's Strategic Plan goal of 90% by posting a graduation rate of 95.9%.

        "description":"Public higher education leaders enter the 2023 legislative sessions with cautious optimism stemming from sizable budget surpluses in many states, economic growth, and mostly familiar political environments. Many states have built up budget surpluses due to a strong economic recovery, an infusion of federal stimulus dollars, and careful budgeting during the pandemic. State budget surpluses provide an opportunity for new investments in public higher education that will accelerate progress toward meeting state educational attainment goals, closing equity gaps, and advancing economic and workforce objectives. This paper provides insight into state policy priorities and concerns for higher education in 2023 through a survey of members of the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association (SHEEO) following the 2022 midterm elections. The authors provided an initial list of issues based on common themes derived from the daily SHEEO policy updates, which include news and updates related to state and national higher education policy. From this list of issues, they asked SHEEOs to look toward 2023 and identify the importance of each higher education issue in their state. Respondents were also asked to provide context or additional information and details on each issue and were given the option to add additional issues to the list. Finally, respondents were asked how the 2022 election results will affect the direction of higher education policy in their states.",

        "author":["Al-Jarf, Reima"],
        "description":"Students majoring in translation at the College of Languages and Translation take a stylistics course (3 hours per week) in the 5th semester of the translation program. The course aims to introduce students to the stylistic features of different genres in English such as journalese, advertisements, commercial, scientific, and legal texts. The present study aims to investigate ESL translation students' ability to comprehend and identify the stylistic features of legal documents, to find out the stylistic features that are easy to identify, and those that are difficult to identify. Sixty EFL junior students enrolled in a Stylistics course took a test which consisted of an English legal (notarial) text and asked them to identify its lexical and syntactic features. Analysis of the subjects' responses showed that the features that they could identify were: Use of legal verbs (69%); prefixing and suffixing of prepositions (63%;) prepositional/adverbial phrases (57%); long complex sentences (52%); coordination of synonyms (doublets) (52%); statements (22%); no adjectives (10%); few pronouns (8%); use of technical vocabulary and emphatic auxiliaries (7% each); use of passive structures, relative clauses and scarce use of pronoun reference (5% each); use adverbs and putting adverbs in an unusual position (3% each); rare pronoun reference, descriptive adjectives, few adjectives, long words, sentence with unusual order, and long nominal clauses (1.6% each). These percentages reflect the difficulty level of the different lexical and syntactic features of the legal text and features with which the students have comprehension difficulties. The lower the percentage, the more difficult the feature is. Difficulties in processing the notarial text may be attributed to lack of linguistic competence and unfamiliarity with the notarial text structure. Recommendations for instructional techniques that would help enhance the students' ability to identify and comprehend the lexical and syntactic structures of legal texts are given.",

The paper analyses Ghana's ECE policy implementation using McDonnell and Elmore's framework of five elemental instruments. We supported the analysis with ECE policy documents and research in ECE. Enabling and inhibiting policy instrument factors affecting ECE were identified and ways were devised to enhance the latter. We found that while ECE policy and practice has somewhat addressed equity and access issues, concerns exist regarding implementation factors such as quality teacher training and parent involvement for promoting effective programs. The paper recommends the need to evaluate ECE and provide planned and ongoing opportunities to advance the professional development, capacity, and motivation of ECE implementers, especially early childhood teachers.",

        "description":"From 2016 to 2021, the Better Math Teaching Network (BMTN) aimed to transform high school mathematics teaching in New England. Researchers and teachers worked together to make high school Algebra I classes more student centered. The BMTN was piloted with a group of nine teachers during the 2015-2016 school year and added teachers the following three years. In all, a total of 63 teachers engaged in the BMTN. Selected from a pool of volunteers that applied to join the network, participating teachers worked in urban, suburban, and rural contexts and taught at least one Algebra I course to 9th grade students. They engaged collaboratively to continuously improve their teaching, enhancing learning for thousands of high school math students throughout New England. Each year, BMTN teachers tested self-identified strategies for making their classrooms more student centered. Their testing was guided by the network's definition of Deep Engagement in Algebra (DEA): connect, justify, and solve. Using learning gleaned from the network, the BMTN hub launched a professional learning community (PLC) in another school district. Involvement in the BMTN has changed teacher practice for all 63 teachers directly involved in the network. Beyond the network participants, many of the routines, tools, and practices will be used in their local contexts in a variety of ways. The BMTN hub's formalized effort to support BMTN teachers in spreading the learning of the network into local contexts (through PLCs) yielded effects on the instructional practices of local teachers in schools, districts, and states throughout New England as well as insight into how networked improvement communities (NICs) might organize for scale.",

        "description":"A variety of measures have been developed to quantify intervention effects for single-case experimental design studies. Within the family of non-overlap indices, the Tau-U measure is one of the most popular indices. There are several Tau-U variants, each one calculated differently. The appropriateness of each Tau-U variant depends upon the data characteristics present within the study (e.g. number of measurement occasions, the within-case variability, and baseline trend). However, inconsistent terminology is used to refer to the Tau-U variants, and researchers can overlook the attributes of the different Tau-U variants. As a result, the Tau-U variants can be applied inappropriately, and this can result in invalid conclusions of intervention effectiveness. This paper proposes a Tau-U flowchart that can assist the decision-making process when using Tau-U with single-case experimental designs that incorporate baseline-intervention (AB) comparisons (e.g. multiple-baseline designs, withdrawal/reversal designs, etc.). The flowchart can help researchers select the appropriate Tau-U variant to use based on their data and research questions. The flowchart is applied to two single-case experimental studies to demonstrate its use.",

Evidence suggests potential developmental trajectories on three key dimensions of network participation: (1) learning how to engage in a network; (2) learning to use the tools of improvement science; and (3) learning to take up the theory of improvement. Additional findings show preliminary variations based on participant characteristics such as teaching tenure, whether they participated in the network with a colleague they knew prior to joining the network or with a school-based colleague, the context of their school, and how student centered they were at the outset of their participation.",

        "description":"Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) has been recommended as a meta-analytic technique for the quantitative synthesis of single-case experimental design (SCED) studies. The HLM approach is flexible and can model a variety of different SCED data complexities, such as intervention heterogeneity. A major advantage of using HLM is that participant and-or study characteristics can be incorporated in the model in an attempt to explain intervention heterogeneity. The inclusion of moderators in the context of meta-analysis of SCED studies did not yet receive attention and is in need of methodological research. Prior to extending methodological work validating the hierarchical linear model including moderators at the different levels, an overview of characteristics of moderators typically encountered in the field is needed. This will inform design conditions to be embedded in future methodological studies and ensure that these conditions are realistic and representative for the field of SCED meta-analyses. This study presents the results of systematic review of SCED meta-analyses, with the particular focus on moderator characteristic. The initial search yielded a total of 910 articles and book chapters. After excluding duplicate studies and non peer-reviewed studies, 658 unique peer-reviewed studies were maintained and screened by two independent researchers. Sixty articles met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for data retrieval. The results of the analysis of moderator characteristics retrieved from these 60 meta-analyses are presented. The first part of the results section contains an overview of moderator characteristics per moderator level (within-participant level, participant level, and study level), including the types of moderators, the ratio of the number of moderators relative to the number of units at that level, the measurement scale, and the degree of missing data. The second part of the results section focuses on the metric used to quantify moderator effectiveness and the analysis approach. Based on the results of the systematic review, recommendations are given for conditions to be included in future methodological work.

        "description":"Reading and comprehending the mother tongue is one of the most important basic academic skills required for the meaningful and significant learning of every subject, especially in earlier stages of education. Though National Policy Frameworks strongly advocate an integrated approach to the teaching of different skills of language, the school does need to pay special attention to reading and writing in many cases, particularly in the case of home languages. However, only a few agencies conducted studies on mother tongue learning at the primary level in Kerala. Elementary level teachers and teacher educators both at pre and in-service levels on an everyday basis have to plan, implement and assess reading comprehension. Hence they are aware of the challenges and possibilities in this respect. The status of reading comprehension in Malayalam was collected from teachers using a detailed online questionnaire. Focus group discussions with experts including DIET faculties, Trainers from Block Resource Centers and Resource persons of in-service teacher training programmes were conducted. Commendable teaching-learning and assessment practices related to reading at the elementary level, the related challenges and limitations were identified in ways that would help practitioners in improving the teaching and assessment of L1 reading comprehension in Malayalam.",

        "description":"This poll was conducted between October 12-October 16, 2021 among a sample of 2,200 adults. The interviews were conducted online and the data were weighted to approximate a target sample of adults based on gender, educational attainment, age, race, and region. Among the key findings are: (1) Parents' comfort with their children returning to school increased once again in October after a sharp decline in August. Overall comfort for a return to school is slowly nearing the level it was at in the Summer of 2021; (2) The percentages of adults who feel the coronavirus has been 'very disruptive' to their personal routine, household routine, and community have either reached or descended below their lowest points since the start of the pandemic; (3) Positive sentiment about the direction of K-12 education on a local level increased by five points in October among both the general population and school parents. There is a nearly 20-point gap between parents' positive views locally compared with how they see K-12 education going for the country; (4) Parents are more likely to be positive and to give A/B grades to school boards than other policymakers for their handling of K-12 education. The latter mostly receive middling or negative ratings from parents and especially the public; (5) The pandemic continues to affect students and families when it comes to schooling. One out of four school parents say they have had to quarantine at least one child in the past month. That quarantine rate is higher among private school parents (41%); (6) Americans continue to have mixed views on mandates for masking and vaccinations. Although, there was once again a slight decrease in support for mandatory masking in October; and (7) Overall support of school choice policies increased this month, especially when additional information was provided. Among school parents, strong support for education savings accounts (ESAs) increased by seven points in October. This report highlights: (1) COVID-19 and schooling; (2) School choice policies; (3) Views on K-12 education; and (4) Survey profile and demographics.",

        "description":"State postsecondary education data systems are vital assets for policymakers, researchers, and the public. The State Higher Education Executive Officers Association's (SHEEO) Communities of Practice project builds upon SHEEO's efforts to measure the capacity and effective use of state postsecondary data systems and provides states with opportunities to develop solutions to common system issues. The seventh Community of Practice convening, &quot;Improving Equity and Opportunity through Postsecondary Data,&quot; was held September 28-29, 2022, in Denver, Colorado. The two-day meeting included more than 80 representatives from 17 states: Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai'i, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, and the District of Columbia. Teams included representatives from SHEEO agency academic affairs, workforce, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and research and data offices and their partners at state agencies and two- and four-year postsecondary institutions. Given the recent impacts on higher education from the COVID-19 pandemic, social justice unrest, and economic pressures facing the country, a focus on equity and opportunity was timely for this Community of Practice. SHEEO agency staff communicated a need to inform state attainment and economic goals through improved collection and use of postsecondary student unit record data. Within and across state teams, Community of Practice attendees were able to learn more about the nuances and impacts of equity-and opportunity-focused data collection, disaggregation, and visualization; to better understand how to effectively communicate and illustrate the need for and the contributions of equitable student success in their states; and to reflect on their capacity, partnerships, and resources available to effectively engage in this work. In this paper, SHEEO shares the presentations, resources, and team activities from the convening. This information can be used by SHEEO agencies to reflect on their current practices, plan and develop effective data policies, and better use data to improve postsecondary equity and opportunity outcomes in their states.",

In this brief, the discussion of the challenges and possibilities focuses on these three levels and on two forms of assessment--formative and summative. Formative assessment, also called assessment for learning, is intended to inform teachers' instructional decisions by producing information about students' progress towards a given set of instructional goals; it allows teachers to glean information about student learning in order to adjust their instruction and/or to provide feedback. Formative assessment activities range from ongoing informal teacher-student conversations to formal teacher-created activities and instruments used at the classroom level, close to students' individual contexts. Summative assessment, also called assessment of learning, is intended to produce information about learning and academic achievement and is used for grading, evaluation, placement, certification, and accountability, among other purposes. While teachers use summative assessment to grade student learning, it is more clearly associated with large-scale, standardized mandatory tests. Measures produced by summative assessment are typically distal from students' classroom experiences, as they tend to sample broad swaths of standards.",

        "description":"Over the last several decades, postsecondary institutions have increasingly enrolled out-of-state and international nonresident students. The increase in out-of-state enrollment has important implications for state higher education funding and policy. Public institutions, particularly research institutions, increased nonresident student enrollment in part to increase their tuition revenue as state funding declined and became less stable. Nonresident student enrollment can increase tuition revenue for public institutions in two ways. First, institutions are more likely to have control over setting and raising nonresident tuition rates. Second, out-of-state and international nonresident students pay much higher tuition rates than state residents. In the 2020-2021 academic year, public four-year institutions charged out-of-state students over 2.5 times the rate of in-state tuition, on average. Despite the growing importance of nonresident tuition revenue in many public institutions' budgets, there is little information about exactly how much of an institution's tuition revenue comes from nonresident tuition and fees. To fill this gap and provide useful data for states and institutions, SHEEO began collecting data on residency annually as part of the fiscal year (FY) 2020 State Higher Education Finance (SHEF) project. This report provides the first look at a new set of state-level data on tuition revenue and student enrollment by residency for FY 2020 and 2021. All data presented in this report are for four-year public institutions. [A complete dataset is available online at shef.sheeo.org/data-downloads.]",

This guide complements the earlier &quot;School Guide&quot; by recommending specific roles and responsibilities for district-level administrators and staffs. Districts' recommended responsibilities include the following: (1) Coordinating with schools and community partners to make EOPs a collaborative effort and help ensure integration with district, local, regional, state, tribal, and federal agency EOPs; (2) Providing planning parameters for use by schools throughout the entire district, e.g., minimum set of annexes, minimum set of prioritized hazards and threats; and (3) Supporting schools at each step as they develop EOPs that address all types of emergencies and are tailored to fit each school's individual needs. This guide recommends that districts apply the same planning principles; follow the same six-step process and complete the tasks associated with each step, that underlie the planning process described in the &quot;School Guide.&quot; The &quot;District Guide,&quot; however, provides more district-focused information. This guide also contains a checklist of activities and responsibilities for districts that allows them to stay on course and track their progress.",

After 21 years of the current accountability framework in federal and state policy in the United States, there is growing recognition that it is not working for students, families, and communities to improve teaching and learning, nor preparing them for the future.

        "description":"The distribution of teaching effectiveness across schools is fundamental to understanding how schools can address disparities in educational outcomes. Research and policy have recognized the importance of teaching effectiveness for decades. Five stylized facts predict that teachers should be differentially allocated across schools such that poor, Black and Hispanic students are taught by less qualified and less effective teachers. Yet, research is unclear whether these predictions have empirical support. Our purpose is to better understand whether there are meaningful differences in teacher effectiveness among schools. We find that poor, Black and Hispanic students are more likely to be taught by novice teachers when they live in more segregated metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Moreover, the geographic nature of segregation varies across MSAs. Differentiating segregation within urban districts and segregation between urban districts and outlying districts in the same MSAs is essential to understanding poor students' exposure to novice teachers and policies that address these disparities. We find that poor, Black and Hispanic students are 50 percent more likely to be exposed to at least one novice teacher during elementary school compared to their more affluent white peers. These results raise questions regarding the enforcement of Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements on the distribution of teacher qualifications and quality.",

The study was guided by one research question: What difficulties do students who receive special education services and become emancipated from the foster care system face when transitioning into independent living? Based on several interviews with Thomas, a 19-year-old, emancipated foster youth who received special education services while in school, four life factors (instability of placement and school, mental health, mentors, and lack of communication) and three causational themes (movement, relationship, and academics) materialized.

        "description":"This study investigated the power of two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to explain variability in intervention effectiveness between participants in context of single-case experimental design (SCED) research. HLM is a flexible technique that allows the inclusion of participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and disability types) as moderators, and as such supplements visual analysis findings. First, this study empirically investigated the power to estimate intervention and moderator effects using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The results indicate that larger values for the true effects and the number of participants resulted in a higher power. The more moderators added to the model, the more participants needed to detect the effects with sufficient power (i.e., power [greater than or equal to]0.80). When a model includes three moderators, at least 20 participants are required to capture the intervention effect and moderator effects with sufficient power. For that same condition, but only including one moderator, seven participants are sufficient. Specific recommendations for designing a SCED study with sufficient power to estimate intervention and moderator effects were provided. Second, this study introduced a newly developed user-friendly point and click Shiny tool, &quot;PowerSCED.&quot; This tool assists applied SCED researchers in designing a SCED study that has sufficient power to detect intervention and moderator effects. To end, the use of HLM with the inclusion of moderators was demonstrated using two previously published SCED studies in the journal &quot;School Psychology Quarterly.&quot;",

        "description":"Disproportionality in disciplinary actions for certain racial groups has been well documented for several decades. In an effort to support all students, specifically those who are culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD), many have called for adopting a multi-tiered system of support framework that is considerate of student culture and school context. This framework applies to supporting students' learning and behavior across settings, particularly in the classroom. To bridge existing gaps between theory and practice, this empirical study sought to evaluate if teachers who self-assessed their own use of culturally and contextually relevant practices would implement a classwide behavior plan with high levels of implementation fidelity. Results indicated that teachers who engaged in self-assessment and training did implement the plan with high levels of implementation fidelity, particularly when given performance feedback. Additionally, students tended to display slightly higher rates of academic engagement upon consistent implementation of the plan.

As more children are starting preschool at the age of 3, and, with the development of programs like Early Head Start, understanding the effect of early literacy interventions for young children became indispensable. This quantitative study was designed to investigate whether children who return to a Head Start program (for a second year or from an Early Head Start Program) have different literacy skills and perform better than newly enrolled children, and to compare returning children's literacy skills from rural, suburban and urban centers. This study uses the Language and Emerging Literacy Assessment (LELA) and analyzes the literacy scores of 2,305 3- and 4-year olds, from 39 Head Start centers in Alabama. The results reveal that returning children have higher literacy skills, but the return effect in centers differs depending on center's location, percentage of 3 year olds, and percentage of ESL children.",

Researchers have documented that student achievement, dropout rates, problem behavior, and teacher retention are related to school climate and few deny the need for schools to be and remain positive environments. In this article, we focused on addressing key questions facing school counseling professionals charged with measuring school climate. We review both the context and practice of documenting the quality and character of life in elementary, middle, and high schools and provide a systematic review and analysis of measures that we believe serves as a preliminary consumer's guide for professionals engaged in important levels of decision making related to monitoring and improving what goes on in schools.",

Across post-secondary institutions, it was immediately apparent that faculty were eager to explore and discuss what this potentially disruptive technology might mean for them, their courses and their students. We wanted to create an opportunity for that discussion and to get a truer sense of initial faculty reactions than what sensational media headlines were offering. This working paper outlines the results of a facilitated online forum, open to faculty and staff from two institutions in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia in January 2023. Our session invited participants to test ChatGPT, reflecting on its strengths and limitations, and then talk through the potential impacts on instructors, our students, and post-secondary education in general of different approaches: ignore it, fight it, and embrace it. Analysis of participant contributions to polls, group discussions and a highly active chat space provide a snapshot of how faculty and staff were feeling and what they were doing in response to ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms. While the data seems to indicate a relatively optimistic take at this early point in the AI revolution, excerpts from discussions and debates do indicate a range of emotions and reactions--a range that will likely only continue to widen with the continuing release of ever more capable AI.",

        "description":"Social network data often contain missing values because of the sensitive nature of the information collected and the dependency among the network actors. As a response, network imputation methods including simple ones constructed from network structural characteristics and more complicated model-based ones have been developed. Although past studies have explored the influence of missing data on social networks and the effectiveness of imputation procedures in many missing data conditions, the current study aims to evaluate a more extensive set of eight network imputation techniques (i.e., null-tie, Reconstruction, Preferential Attachment, Con strained Random Dot Product Graph, Multiple Imputation by Bayesian Exponential Random Graph Models or BERGMs, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) under more practical conditions through comprehensive simulation. A factorial design for missing data conditions is adopted with factors including missing data types, missing data mechanisms, and missing data proportions, which are applied to generated social networks with varying numbers of actors based on 4 different sets of coefficients in ERGMs. Results show that the effectiveness of imputation methods differs by missing data types, missing data mechanisms, the evaluation criteria used, and the complexity of the social networks. More complex methods such as the BERGMs have consistently good performances in recovering missing edges that should have been present. While simpler methods like Reconstruction work better in recovering network statistics when the missing proportion of present edges is low, the BERGMs work better when more present edges are missing. The BERGMs also work well in recovering ERGM coefficients when the networks are complex and the missing data type is actor non-response. In conclusion, researchers analyzing social networks with incomplete data should identify the network structures of interest and the potential missing data types before selecting appropriate imputation methods.

While some of these innovations emerged before the pandemic, the massive disruption to instruction fueled a new urgency to rethink the potential of assessments to drive better teaching and learning. States and communities are working together to create more balanced systems of assessment that better support instruction while still providing the information necessary to inform policy and resource decisions. There is much to learn from the ideas emerging across the nation--particularly where states are trying to innovate despite limitations of federal policy. The insights and innovations emerging from this paper have the potential to cast a new vision for K-12 assessment in the United States. This work details efforts across the nation to encourage, support and grow innovative state assessment systems, and represents a significant increase in recent state-level energy and action around new forms of assessment to provide deeper and more meaningful understanding of student learning.

        "description":"As a technology-based approach to learning, flipped classrooms have lately stood out on various stages and fields of education. As opposed to the traditional education, the flipped classroom enables learners to watch the content videos presented by the course teacher in advance, and to come to classes with some preliminary work to engage in collaborative activities guided by the teacher. A majority of language-related studies of flipped learning adopted both quantitative and qualitative data to indicate the differences of conventional versus flipped instructional treatments, generally conducted in relation to specific language skills or language aspects such as speaking and grammar. Due to the scarcity of research in teacher training field and the differing findings on the model's effects from the previous studies, the present research aims to obtain further evidence of the influence of flipped learning and to extend the existing literature by delving into the field of language teacher training. This study tries to understand whether the flipped classroom approach leads to improvements in the trainee teachers' course achievements. Additionally, the research will comprise the trainee teachers' views regarding their flipped learning experiences. A total of 114 learner scores were statistically compared, and voluntary English Language Teacher trainees provided survey (n=72) and interview (n=18) data from the flipped Linguistics and Teaching English Vocabulary courses in the education faculty of a state university. It was found that the difference between the scores of the two instructional modes was not statistically significant but the participants generously contributed to our understanding of the interactions in the flipped mode of education in the Turkish culture. This pilot study, with its constructive and practical implications, yields significant insights into the nature and administration of teacher training in the flipped model, and will form the basis for a more detailed action research to be conducted in the following term.",

A regression discontinuity (RD) design was used to examine how the schools' mandate status related to SW-PBIS training as well as student suspensions, truancy, and achievement in 410 public middle and high schools, of which 261 were affected by the mandate. We further examined the growth trajectories (i.e., improvement) of implementation fidelity over time using growth mixture modeling (GMM). Contrary to the intent of the policy to improve student outcomes, the RD results suggested the mandate did not impact reading and math achievement, truancy rates, or SW-PBIS training in 2010-11 through 2013-14. Mandated schools did have higher suspension rates in 2010-11 through 2013-14 than the non-mandated schools, however, these differences in the suspension rates appear to have persisted from years prior to the mandate. Descriptive analyses suggested that mandated schools had statistically significantly higher rates of training, and the GMM analyses on the fidelity data indicated that mandated schools were significantly more likely to be in an improving growth trajectory over time. Taken together, results suggested that the policy showed some promise for improving SW-PBIS training and fidelity over time, but it had little to no impact on student outcomes.",

This exploration of early integration and academic outcomes of first-year students uses Tinto's (1993) Longitudinal Model of Institutional Departure as the theory upon which to select and categorize relevant variables according to the key elements (pre-entry attributes, goals, experiences, and integration). Furthermore, pre-entry attributes, goals, institutional experiences, and perceived early academic and social fit/integration were used to predict multiple student outcomes. The study asked: (1) To what extent are elements from Tinto's Model related to indicators of early academic and social fit for first-year students at UNC Charlotte?; and (2) To what extent are elements from Tinto's Model including early academic and social integration, predicting student outcomes measured by second- and third-semester enrollment, first- and second-semester GPA, and first- and second-semester earned-hours ratios of first-year students at UNC Charlotte? The UNC Charlotte's Division of Student Affairs administered the Evaluating Academic Success Effectively (EASE) survey, which provided data on first-year students six weeks after arriving at the University for their initial college experience. The findings showed that perceived preparation in writing papers, perceived family support, participation in class, first-generation status, and participation in a club or sport are significant positive predictors for both types of fit--early academic and social. Additionally, math preparation was significant for academic fit, and studying with peers outside of class was significant for social fit. Predicted GPA (a measure used in the admission process at UNC Charlotte), perceived preparation in math, family support, participation in a club or support, perceived academic fit, and perceived social fit were all positive predictors for multiple outcome measures. Being male, first generation, and social fit were all negative predictors for multiple outcomes. The social fit finding is negative for GPA, but positive for the likelihood of returning to college.",

Lambda corrects for chance agreement based on specific assumptions about raters and the rater-mediated assessment process including rater-specific tendencies for strict or lenient ratings. Actual ratings of teacher profiles from an interrater reliability exercise confirmed the shortcomings of Kappa. The rater data also demonstrated the robustness of Lambda-1, Lambda-2, Gwet's AC1, and Gwet's AC2 to the data conditions that are problematic for Kappa. All four alternative chance-corrected agreement coefficients showed less variability across the 65 raters than Kappa. However, AC-2 was undetermined for 57 of the 65 raters.

        "description":"Each game within the Ignite by Hatch™ gaming environment belongs to an overall developmental domain and skills-based subdomain and is intended to meet the developmental needs of children at specific skill levels. These skill levels (Beginning, Emerging, Intermediate, Accomplishing, and Proficient+) form an intended developmental pathway. Children make progress through games of increasing difficulty and complexity to the focal skills as they complete the games. The skills they acquire in this process build upon each other. The purpose of this study was to examine how children perform in the gaming environment to determine if there is evidence that the game difficulty level actually progresses as intended. The analyses outlined in this report were conducted using data from the entire population of 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children who used Ignite during the 2021-2022 academic year (n = 63,465). Evidence was gathered in three ways. First, it was assumed that 5-year-old children would perform better than 4-year-old children, and 4-year-old children would perform better than 3-year-old children, across all games given their expected higher developmental level. To test this assumption, the author compared initial pass rates of the age groups across all games. Second, it was assumed that initial and final pass rates would be highest for Beginning games and then would decline as game difficulty level increased in turn for Emerging, Intermediate, Accomplishing, and Proficient games. To test this assumption, the author compared initial and final pass rates and game difficulty levels across the skill levels within each domain. Third, it was assumed that children who engage with the Ignite system at recommended levels of usage should outperform children who do not use the system at recommended levels. To test this assumption, the author compared the highest game levels achieved by children in subgroups according to usage levels. The results of this study demonstrated strong validity evidence for the Ignite learning games by supporting all three assumptions.",

In this paper the results of differential item functioning (DIF) analyses for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Preventive Resources Inventory (PRI), and the Brief COPE are presented. Data from N = 860 German and Singapore social work students were analyzed using the Rasch Partial Credit Model by comparing item difficulties. Large DIF was found in 3 of the 10 items from the PSS, in 15 of 82 items from the PRI and in 5 out of 28 items from the Brief COPE. Implications for the use of the measures are discussed.",

The purpose of the MSP grant program was to develop standards-based elementary mathematics teachers by giving teachers the tools to teach with a new standards-based mathematics curriculum, &quot;Investigations in Number, Data, and Space&quot; (&quot;Investigations&quot;). The participants were teachers in two school systems located near a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. System One is a large, urban school system and System Two is a smaller suburban school system in a neighboring city. The two school systems conducted professional development separately and on different days throughout the grant program, but the overall content and focus of the professional development remained consistent. The professional development facilitators worked with both groups of teachers. Since the MSP project is not a longitudinal design, teachers participants exit from the program at the end of the academic year. The focus of this report is to examine the impacts of the professional development on teacher beliefs, practices, mathematics content knowledge, and student learning outcomes.",

GPE convenes partners and mobilizes funds to help governments in 90 lower-income countries build and finance strong and sustainable education systems that deliver quality learning to more girls and boys, especially those who are marginalized by poverty, gender, disability or displacement. Strengthening resilience and mitigating the systemic impacts of crisis continue to be critical to GPE's mission. The range and frequency of crises in GPE partner countries calls for GPE to ensure that preparedness for responding to crises and changing circumstances are integral parts of diagnostics, sector planning and implementation support, and that our operational model is flexible enough to respond to changing circumstances. This operational framework outlines approaches that allow GPE to support education systems when countries experience a crisis with systemic impacts on the education system. The introduction is followed by an overview of GPE's support to fragile and conflict-affected contexts up to now. The framework then outlines the principles for engaging in these contexts as well as GPE's approach under the 2025 strategic period. The final section outlines the processes and mechanisms available for adapting GPE's engagement after the emergence of a crisis.",

        "description":"Based on the recommendations of the K-3 Assessment Think Tank, an assessment design team consisting of current and former educators and early childhood education scholars developed a kindergarten entry formative assessment (KEA) which was piloted in 193 classrooms during the first 60 instructional days of the 2014-2015 academic year. North Carolina (NC) intended the pilot to be a first step toward scaling-up to a full statewide K-3 formative assessment process. Over the course of the NC KEA pilot, the authors conducted case studies of eight pilot schools selected for their demographic representativeness of the total NC kindergarten student population. These case studies involved classroom observations and semi-structured interviews with pilot teachers, administrators, and instructional coaches. Following the case studies, an electronic survey that was open to all pilot participants was conducted. The purpose of this qualitative study was to gather teacher and administrator perspectives of the NC KEA and determine whether: (1) changes were necessary to the professional development provided for the assessment; (2) the content of the learning progressions were developmentally appropriate; (3) the documentation process worked within teachers' routine classroom instruction; (4) teachers found the assessment's data useful in driving their instructional decisions; (5) the assessment aligned with the curriculum and assessment practices currently in place within their district and school; and (6) there were characteristic patterns between schools and/or classrooms where the assessment was being implemented with fidelity and those where it was not.",

        "description":"New research, using data from 7 million students in grades 3-8 in 25,000 schools who took MAP Growth reading and mathematics assessments between 2020-21 and fall 2022, continues NWEA's ongoing research agenda examining how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected student achievement in reading and math. At the start of the 2022-23 school year, we continue to see evidence that students are rebounding from the impacts of the pandemic: the distance between students' math and reading achievement relative to pre-pandemic levels continued to narrow from spring 2021 when pandemic-induced achievement gaps were at their widest. Students lost less ground over summer 2022 compared to pre-pandemic trends. Academic rebounding in reading and math continued in fall 2022; however, rebounding is not even across school years and summers, especially in reading. The youngest students (current third-graders who were kindergarteners when the pandemic began) have the largest reading achievement gap and showed the least rebounding, suggesting that disrupted learning at such a critical juncture was particularly detrimental to acquiring foundational reading skills and has a lingering effect on the youngest students' reading development. While the evidence of rebounding is encouraging, student achievement remains lower than in a typical year and full recovery is likely still several years away. Schools and districts should continue to use data to understand which students have been most harmed and to provide supports in proportion to students' unmet needs.

GPE's work includes providing technical support in this area for the benefit of country operations, including the development and/or dissemination of tools and guidelines. Some GPE partner countries have shown particular interest in diagnostic or analytical tools to better understand the scope of their challenges related to quality teaching and the broader education workforce. Guidance in diagnosing the challenges of the education workforce and leveraging its potential for strengthened teaching and learning would be useful especially for those involved in preparing education sector plans or strategies, or specific programs aimed at improving teaching and learning. This paper: (1) Analyzes the guidance that prominent existing international frameworks and tools can provide for diagnosing challenges and strengths related to teachers and the broader education workforce. Special attention is given to tools dealing with teachers, teaching and learning and/or related policies and management, and for which several country applications have been reported. Challenges concerning the implementation and use of these tools are also explored tentatively through a set of interviews with professionals involved in their application and/or monitoring; (2) Attempts to identify the main gaps and challenges that remain to be addressed as regards the contents, methodology and implementation of future education workforce diagnostics; and (3) Suggests possible directions and considerations for the development of future education workforce diagnostic tools.",

        "description":"Monitoring the Future (MTF) has become one of the nation's most relied upon scientific sources of valid information on trends in use of licit and illicit psychoactive drugs by U.S. adolescents, college students, young adults, and adults up to age 60. During the last four decades, the study has tracked and reported on the use of an ever-growing array of such substances in these populations of adolescents and adults. The annual MTF series of monographs is one of the primary mechanisms through which the new epidemiological findings are reported. Findings from the inception of the study in 1975 through 2022 are included--the results of 48 national in-school surveys and 46 national follow up surveys. MTF has conducted in-school surveys of nationally representative samples of: (1) 12th grade students each year since 1975; and (2) 8th and 10th grade students each year since 1991. In addition, beginning with the class of 1976, the study has conducted follow up surveys of representative subsamples of the respondents from each previously participating 12th grade class. These follow up surveys now continue well into adulthood, currently up to age 60. MTF is designed to detect age, period, and cohort effects in substance use and related attitudes. Age effects are similar changes at similar ages seen across multiple class cohorts; they are common during adolescence. Period effects are changes that are parallel over a number of years across multiple age groups (in this case, all three grades under study--8, 10, and 12). Cohort effects are substance use behaviors or attitudes that distinguish a class cohort from others that came before or after them and are maintained as the cohort ages. The survey results divide cleanly into the time periods before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. All surveys in 2020 were completed before March 15, when data collection was halted due to pandemic concerns. Consequently, results from 2020 and previous years are pre-pandemic, while results from 2021 and 2022 took place after the onset of the pandemic and the associated national response.

        "description":"Monitoring the Future (MTF) is designed to give such attention to substance use among the nation's youth and adults. It is an investigator-initiated study that originated with, and is conducted by, a team of research professors at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. Since its onset in 1975, MTF has been funded continuously by the National Institute on Drug Abuse--one of the National Institutes of Health--under a series of peer reviewed, competitive research grants. The 2022 survey, reported here, is the 48th consecutive national survey of 12th grade students and the 32nd national survey of 8th and 10th grade students (who were added to the study in 1991). MTF contains ongoing national surveys of both adolescents and adults in the United States. It provides the nation with a vital window into the important but often hidden problem behaviors of use of illegal drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and psychotherapeutic drugs (used without a doctor's orders). For more than four decades, MTF has helped provide a clearer view of the changing topography of these problems among adolescents and adults, a better understanding of the dynamics of factors that drive some of these problems, and a better understanding of some of their consequences. It has also given policymakers, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the field some practical approaches for intervening. Two of the major topics included in the present monograph are: (1) the prevalence and frequency of use of a great many substances, both licit and illicit, among U.S. secondary school students in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades; and (2) historical trends in use by students in those grades. Distinctions are made among important demographic subgroups in these populations based on gender, college plans, region of the country, population density, parent education, and race/ethnicity. MTF has demonstrated that key attitudes and beliefs about drug use are important determinants of usage trends, in particular the amount of risk to the user perceived to be associated with the various drugs and disapproval of using them; thus, those measures also are tracked over time, as are students' perceptions of certain relevant aspects of the social environment--in particular, perceived availability of each drug, peer norms about their use, use by friends, and exposure to use by others of the various drugs. Data on grade of first use, noncontinuation of use, trends in use in lower grades (based on retrospective reports), and intensity of use are also reported here.

        "description":"Up until 2020, National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading scores had increased only slightly since the early 1990s with large achievement gaps for students of color and students living in poverty. Modest gains in fourth grade reading proficiency since 1992 were erased during the pandemic. The insufficient progress in reading even before the pandemic suggests that teachers need more and better instruction in how to teach reading. In response, the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) revised its &quot;Teacher Prep Review&quot; Reading Foundations standard (formerly known as the Early Reading standard) to address advances in research and the rigor of the standard. This revised standard seeks to better reflect the field's expectations for preparation programs in teaching aspiring teacher how to teach reading, better identifying those programs that excel in preparing aspiring teachers in this area, and clearly indicating the areas of improvement needed by teacher preparation programs to improve teacher efficacy in teaching reading. The revision of the NCTQ Reading Foundations standard also updates the indicators of what programs are teaching (referred to as instructional approaches)--&quot;Instructional Hours,&quot; &quot;Objective Measures of Knowledge,&quot; &quot;Practice/Application,&quot; and &quot;Background Materials.&quot; NCTQ revised the Reading Foundations standard to reflect current research on scientifically based reading instruction and on the knowledge and skills needed by teachers.

As GPE develops its next strategic plan, this report can serve as a reflection of the current landscape as well as a think piece in considering how best to support partner countries and the wider partnership in aspirations toward ensuring that children and young people are equipped with the broad range of skills that they need to be active, engaged and productive members of their communities, countries and the globalized world more broadly.",

        "description":"Transferring to a four-year institution is an important pathway to student success. Many students who enroll in community college intend to transfer to a four-year institution and subsequently earn a bachelor's degree. However, few students ultimately do, with low-income students transferring at lower rates than their peers. The Texas Transfer Grant Pilot Program was created by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) to improve the transfer rates of students from two-year to four-year institutions in Texas. The pilot program offered $5,000 grants to community college students who performed well academically, came from low-income backgrounds, and transferred to a public four-year institution. MDRC's evaluation of the program, conducted in partnership with the THECB, used Texas statewide administrative data to identify and randomly assign about 90,000 eligible students. Students were assigned to either a program group (whose members were notified they were eligible to receive the grant for the fall 2022 semester) or a control group (whose members did not receive a Texas Transfer Grant offer but who could seek business-as-usual financial aid resources). Students assigned to the program group were informed of the opportunity to receive a grant via email and hard-copy letters. This brief answers the following two primary questions: (1) Does offering the Texas Transfer Grant to community college students affect their enrollment rates at four-year higher education institutions in Texas? and (2) What do community college students think--and how do they feel--about the Texas Transfer Grant offer, particularly with respect to their decision to transfer to a four-year institution? Although additional research is needed to fully understand the impact of the grant offer, early findings indicate that the pilot program increased the proportion of students who enrolled in Texas public four-year institutions.

The brunt of these effects has been felt by the nation's working parents, who were tasked with supervising the virtual schooling of their children while also telecommuting, reporting to their jobs as essential personnel, and in some instances, looking for new work. This brief describes the experiences of working parents and their opinions of the policies and supports offered by their employers and school districts. The goal of this effort was to document how the pandemic affected New Jersey households socially, psychologically, and economically, and describe the ways employers and local education boards adapted their policies to accommodate, or not accommodate, the plight of parents working and schooling during a challenging and unprecedented time.

        "description":"The main problem of this study is to determine the relationship of organizational trust to the level of trust in leadership as perceived by teachers in the City Schools Division of Meycauayan for the school year 2019-2020. Specifically, the study examined the following: (1) administrator characteristics and predisposition of personnel; (2) level of trust in leadership; (3) relationship between organizational trust and the level of trust in leadership; and, (4) management intervention based on the findings. The study used the descriptive method of research. A standardized survey questionnaire from the manual of Burke, Sims, Lazzara, and Salas' Trust in Leadership Multi-level Review and Integration (2007) was utilized. The findings were: (1) The administrator characteristics consist of ability, benevolence, and integrity. The overall verbal interpretation is A or agree. Predisposition of personnel consists of propensity to trust, attribution style, perceived risk, and leadership prototype. The overall verbal interpretation is A or agree; (2) The level of trust in leadership consists of communication, learning, performance, turnover, and willingness to follow. The overall verbal interpretation is CE or considerable extent; (3) There is a significant relationship between trust in leadership and organizational trust; and (4) The management intervention proposed was that of Starnes, Truhon, and McCarthy (2011). The conclusions are: (1) The teachers in the City Schools Division of Meycauayan agree that their administrators possess ability, benevolence, and integrity and the respondents agree that they possess the predisposition of personnel; (2) The teachers in the City Schools Division of Meycauayan trust their administrators to a considerable extent; (3) There is a significant relationship between organizational trust and trust in leadership; and (4) The management intervention proposed was leading a culture of organizational trust by Starnes, Truhon, and McCarthy (2011). The researcher recommends to: (1) Use the organizing framework of competence, benevolence, and integrity of this study to clarify issues of trust in your educational institution; (2) Set a clear, compelling direction; (3) Create an enabling structure; (4) Provide expert coaching; (5) Continue to genuinely care about your personnel; (6) Maintain the cultivated trust of your personnel; (7) Reciprocate the care and concern of your subordinates; (8) Continue to provide coaching; (9) Promote justice; (10) Adhere to a set of principles that your personnel find acceptable; (11) Maintain a good leader reputation; (12) Invest on your personnel trust; and (13) Future researches may consider alternative methodologies and design a more enhanced survey questionnaire.",

        "description":"Better data is needed on disability in Global Partnership for Education (GPE) partner countries to understand the extent to which children with disabilities are excluded from education, so that countries can make evidence-based and inclusive education policy and plans, and progress can be monitored globally. As part of its work helping to build robust education management information systems (EMIS), GPE has supported work on collecting better data on disability through school censuses. However, there are limitations on the extent to which EMIS can gather accurate data on individual children's disabilities or on children who are out of school. Nationally representative household surveys and censuses that collect data on both education and disability using reliable and comparable methods are essential sources of information on the extent to which children with disabilities are in school and completing school. This working paper assesses the availability of household surveys and censuses with disability data across GPE partner countries collected between 2010-2020 and concludes with recommendations for making more and better data available.",

        "description":"The project, Seeking Work in Southern New Jersey, set out to explore the economic landscape, identify barriers and opportunities to finding and securing a job, and outline challenges to connections between job seekers and employers in Southern New Jersey and the City of Camden. The project's goal was to illuminate the story behind traditional economic numbers -- to explore the perspectives of job seekers and employers in Southern New Jersey and the City of Camden. Researchers conducted a series of focus groups and individual conversations with both employers and job seekers, and captured the experiences, challenges, and opportunities posed by individuals both seeking and filling jobs in a pre- and -post pandemic economic landscape. Researchers then combined this qualitative input with current labor force data to inform understanding of workforce trends and barriers across the region's eight counties. This report is the result of that data collection and analysis, and aims to provide insights into unique workforce trends and barriers across the region's eight counties and within the City of Camden. Job seeker and employer responses showed the choices residents made to advance their careers, how companies have shifted and changed, and considerations related to economic opportunities and structural barriers. Key themes emerged from the data, centered on job seekers' and employers' responses through the pandemic: opportunity, flexibility, and access. [This project was in partnership with the Senator Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs (WRI) at Rutgers University--Camden and the Camden Community Partnership. It was funded by the Rowan University/Rutgers---Camden Board of Governors.]",

Building on that work, Citizens &amp; Scholars has launched a multi-year initiative on Civic Measurement. The first major milestone is a new report, &quot;Mapping Civic Measurement: How are we assessing readiness and opportunities for an engaged citizenry?&quot; &quot;Mapping Civic Measurement&quot; is a comprehensive civic measurement landscape review and a first-of-its-kind framework for mapping civic readiness and opportunities. The report features a collection of measurement tools, rubrics, and more than 200 resources in use by practitioners across education, business, philanthropy, community institutions, media, government, and civil society. You'll come away from the report with new ways to think about measuring civic learning impact, new research to inform your work, and new opportunities to connect with other practitioners. Now is the time to come together to cultivate people as informed, engaged, and hopeful citizens. Creating a common knowledge base and practices to measure civic readiness and opportunities will enable us to chart the course to a healthy and robust democracy that works for all.",

Such young people include those with a history of arrests, incarceration, violent behavior, or gang involvement, and often a disconnection from education and work. The organization focuses specifically on reaching those who are not likely to connect with mainstream institutions or traditional programs, and engages them in cognitive behavioral therapy and an array of education, employment, and supportive services that seek to address the traumas and challenges that have shaped their lives. In Massachusetts, Roca operates programs for young men and women, but the program in Baltimore currently focuses on the city's young men. MDRC is partnering with Roca to study its Baltimore program. This report presents findings from a small-scale, qualitative study designed to use participant cases and voices to create a more detailed picture of the young men Roca Baltimore serves and the ways the program works with them.

The relationship between the two forms of bullying is strong and varies considerably among the participating TIMSS 2019 countries. Evidence from TIMSS reveals that, while cyberbullying has a relatively high incidence in all educational systems, it also reflects regional and gender differences with boys experiencing higher levels of cyberbullying than girls.

This assessment framework provides a conceptual underpinning for the international instrumentation for ICCS 2022. It needs to identify and define those aspects of cognitive and affective-behavioral content that should be considered important learning outcomes of civic and citizenship education, as well as contextual factors that are setting the context for students' civic learning. The ICCS 2022 assessment framework consists of four parts: (1) the civic knowledge framework (describing aspects to be addressed when measuring students' civic knowledge and understanding); (2) the civic attitudes and engagement framework (describing the affective-behavioral constructs to be measured); (3) the contextual framework (outlining the relevant context factors measured through student, teacher, school, and national contexts questionnaires necessary to understand cognitive and affective-behavioral learning outcomes); and (4) the assessment design (describing the coverage of framework domains, the different item types, the assessment design, features of computer-enhanced measurement used in the international option of a computer-based delivery, and the expected cognitive, affective-behavioral and contextual indices). The framework also includes appendices with information about staff and institutions involved in ICCS 2022, key terms related to the civic knowledge framework, information on the described levels of civic knowledge, and examples of ICCS 2022 test items.

        "description":"The Newark Opportunity Youth Network (NOYN) contracted with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the youth workforce development system within the state. The study documents how the youth workforce system developed in New Jersey since the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) took effect, how it currently functions, and the financial and systemic realities that historically have been an impediment to a more collaborative approach. An unfortunate truth is that sometimes state legislatures design policies that, perhaps unintentionally, inhibit a community's ability to achieve collective impact through leveraging multiple resources. Compliance-driven funding models that limit a program's ability to connect with other programs to expand the impact, or disconnected public agencies that allocate funds and operate programs, to name a few, create obstacles to achieving collective impact. This research aims to provide stakeholders, including direct service providers and policymakers, with the tools to navigate these obstacles to better serve young people in New Jersey. The literature available around youth workforce development specifically in New Jersey is sparse, so to complement the literature review, researchers conducted in-depth interviews with local and national experts in youth workforce development. For those who advocate on behalf of the population of opportunity or alternative youth, the question demanding an answer is what can and should be done to improve the system of youth workforce development to better serve disconnected youth? This study begins to respond to that question. [This report was produced with the Newark Opportunity Youth Network (NOYN), with funding from the Aspen Institute Forum for Community Solutions.]",

        "description":"The IEA's International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) investigates the ways in which young people are prepared to undertake their roles as citizens in a range of countries in the second decade of the 21st century. ICCS 2016 is the second cycle of a study initiated in 2009. This technical report follows the publication of several international and regional reports that presented the results of ICCS 2016. It comprises detailed information on the development of the instruments, including their translation and translation verification, sampling design and implementation, field operations and quality control of data collection, data management, sampling weights and participation rates, and the scaling, analysis and reporting of ICCS 2016 data. The technical report enables researchers to evaluate published reports and articles based on data from this study and, used in conjunction with the ICCS 2016 User Guide for the International Database, will provide guidance for their own analyses. Over the past 50 years, the IEA has conducted comparative research studies in a range of domains focusing on educational policies, practices, and outcomes in many countries around the world. The association conducted its first survey of civic education in 1971. The rich and robust comparative ICCS 2016 database will allow participating education systems to evaluate the strengths of their educational policies, both internationally and within a regional context, and to measure their progress toward achieving critical components of the United Nations' 2030 agenda for sustainable development.

        "author":["Domanico, Ray"],
        "description":"In New York State, private and religious schools are required to offer a curriculum &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to what is available in local public schools. Substantial equivalency--which has been law for nearly 130 years--allows parents to direct the education of their children by enrolling them in the school of their choice, while also ensuring that schools meet certain standards. However in September 2022, the New York State Board of Regents amended the regulations governing the law's enforcement. The amendments follow a multiyear effort on the part of a small group of activists who voiced concerns over a particular group of religious schools in New York City and a few other counties in the state. These schools serve the &quot;Haredi&quot; Jewish community, also described as ultraorthodox. There are critical public-policy and legal issues within the debate over Haredi schools and the state's substantial-equivalence requirement, particularly how to weigh the right to religious freedom enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. This issue brief will explore those issues and attempt to place them in the context of the communities that overwhelmingly choose these schools for their children.",

A phenomenological study is a research that focuses on what people experience and how they experience what they experience. The population of the research consisted of female athlete students who study in public primary, secondary and high schools within the borders of Kepez District of Antalya province in the 2022-2023 academic year, and the sample of the study consisted of 8 female athlete students studying at primary and secondary school in Aslanlar Secondary School. As a data collection tool, a semi-structured interview form consisting of 5 questions prepared by the researcher and including questions about personal information was used. As a result of the research, it was found that sports team life had many positive benefits for social development, personality development, physical development and academic development.",

        "description":"This report is about the educational borders that have sprung up across America. Some are school district boundaries. They can form an invisible barrier between students and the schools that they might want to attend. Other borders, often aligned with the municipal boundaries of cities, counties, and states, restrict who can teach where, how much teachers are paid, and what their retirement looks like. All have profoundly shaped the way that American schools look. In this report, the authors explain how school district boundaries, which limit where children can attend school, can have negative impacts on students and homeowners, especially the most disadvantaged. They also explain how boundaries, in the form of pension rules, negatively affect teachers. They propose an alternative: a system with fewer boundaries--one that allows students to access a wide array of schools, regardless of where they live, and one that does not punish teachers for moving between public, charter, or private sectors, or between states (or even within states, in some instances)--will improve outcomes for students, increase equity among homeowners, and promote retirement security for teachers. The authors argue that as states continue to move toward providing more educational opportunities for families, teachers will need to fill some of the demands for a diverse set of options. The way that educational systems compensate teachers, however, is outdated and ill-equipped to facilitate a dynamic teacher labor market to meet families' needs.",

        "description":"In order to realize all the benefits of parental-choice programs, advocates, policymakers, and participating schools have to pay more attention to implementation challenges, both when designing parental-choice policies and after new programs are enacted. This report discusses both categories of implementation challenges. The first category--challenges that result from policy design--includes features of many programs that make them difficult to implement, such as limits on the tax benefits available in scholarship tax-credit programs, low scholarship amounts, and eligibility restrictions. The second category--challenges that occur after programs are enacted--result from advocates' and participating schools' failure to take steps that would increase the likelihood of programmatic success, such as prioritizing academic improvement among program participants, better informing parents about the choices available to them, and encouraging the development of more and better schools and school networks. This report focuses on &quot;private-school-choice&quot; programs--that is, programs that enable students to use public resources for private-school tuition. To the extent that education savings account (ESA) funds are used to enable participants to attend private schools, as they will be in many, if not most, cases, the report addresses implementation issues affecting ESAs. While the policy landscape is shifting rapidly, and more states undoubtedly will enact universal ESAs in the months and years to come--the vast majority of parental-choice programs are, and will continue to be, limited in scope and eligibility, necessitating continued attention to the issues addressed in this report critical to their success.",

Providers considered the strategies to be acceptable, appropriate, and effective, though barriers of time and complexity were noted.

        "description":"The Council of Higher Education (CoHE) switched to distance education with digital tools in all universities as of March 23, 2020. The relevant decision was put into effect by the universities. Since this date, distance education has been utilized in almost all programs in universities. COVID-19 Pandemic period was finished, and face-to-face education was started in 2021. This research aims to analyze the satisfaction levels of undergraduate students with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, the research study group designed in the scanning model consists of 1605 students enrolled at Tekirdag Namik Kemal University. The research data were obtained with the &quot;Scale on the Satisfaction Levels of University Students with Distance Education,&quot; which was developed by Baltaci, Mercan-Annak, Akbay, Akaydin and Sökmensüer (2021) and whose validity and reliability have been proven. The SPSS Statistics 20 program analyzed the data. It was investigated whether the satisfaction levels of undergraduate students with distance education showed a statistically significant difference concerning certain variables during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study determined that undergraduate students were generally satisfied with the distance education they received during the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistically significant difference was found between the satisfaction levels of undergraduate students with distance education applications based on gender, department, self-efficacy perception of computer use skills, and having problems accessing distance education. On the other hand, no statistically significant difference was seen between the satisfaction levels of undergraduate students with distance education applications based on age, grade level, regular Internet access, and distance education status before the epidemic.",

        "description":"The bachelor's degree remains a fundamental path to economic opportunity in the United States. Critical for policymakers, then, is ensuring equitable access to such benefits--a task often constrained by long-standing structural barriers. One of the most obvious structural impediments for bachelor's degree-aspirants in California (CA) is the current version of the CA Master Plan for Higher Education. With a robust public higher education system that is continually forced to adapt to demographic shifts and evolving labor markets, California is an especially important region for exploring the future of postsecondary education and economic growth. This report describes what we currently know about the California Community College Baccalaureate (CCB) program that was launched in 2017 and expanded in 2021. The program shows promising outcomes and that state education leaders can leverage existing components of the state's education ecosystem to meet the economic and social demands of 40 million diverse Californians and to close existing racial equity gaps. This report was published as part of a new research series, &quot;A Civil Rights Agenda for California's Next Quarter Century,&quot; in commemoration of the Civil Rights Project's 25th anniversary.",

This talent pool attracts businesses and residents to the state, expanding job opportunities, further developing the labor force, and fostering economic growth. Recent data from the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) on post-graduation debt and income, however, suggest that a substantial proportion of programs fail to generate satisfactory economic outcomes that reasonably enable alumni to pay back their student loan debt. The TPPF data demonstrate the performance of more than 900 bachelor's, master's, professional, and doctoral degree programs across North Carolina. By categorizing these programs based on the debt and income of their graduates, we are able to identify those programs that are most in need of oversight, reform, or closure. The report also allows prospective students and their families to make better-informed decisions regarding their college and later careers. Unlike resources that merely review the potential income for types of programs generally, the report provides detailed information on income and debt for specific programs at specific schools in North Carolina, providing a uniquely high-resolution picture of the financial risks and opportunities faced by UNC students today.",

It allows them to climb higher in the professional rankings or even get higher pay for their academic work. All graduate students are adults and self-directed due to their past experiences in work or practice. However, when the pandemic hit the world, these self-directed learners were not spared from shutting of schools. In the Philippines, most graduate schools deliver their lessons through the traditional mode or face-to-face until the pandemic that they shifted in the emerging online learning modality. Using the mixed method of quantitative and qualitative type of study the researchers were able to gather 419 graduate students from various regions of the archipelago to take part in the study. The researchers found out that upon experiencing the benefits of online learning, graduate students want to continue this modality even in the future. More than a third of the respondents also claimed that they want the blended or hybrid type of graduate studies as opposed to going back to the more traditional face-to-face classes. The reasons for these can vary on each learner's situation.",

An Ishikawa diagram is a visual representation that graphically depicts the relationships between a certain result and its causes. The studied effect or negative problem is called &quot;the fish head,&quot; and the potential causes and sub-causes are called &quot;the fishbone structure.&quot; It was found out that people as a factor, in consideration of the student athlete's privileges and incentives, the distance of the practice venue from the school, school service for transportation, availability, and maintenance of sports equipment are some of the causes that might result in a certain problem in introducing and uplifting sports to our students. In conclusion, the concerns that complicate a problem require professional agreement and smart decisions. This, in turn, will lead to a harmonious flow of events and a successful potential athlete that needs to be recognized in a certain field of skills.

        "description":"Historically, higher learning was based on the study of the Great Works of thought of the Western canon. These works span a broad range of time, from the Classical period, to early Christianity, and the Enlightenment, all the way to the 20th century. Presently, close study of Great Works is less common at most mainstream colleges and universities. Depending on the general education programs at a given institution, or students' particular course work, it is very possible for students to graduate from college with little to no exposure to the foundational texts of Plato, Aristotle, Homer, or Dante, to name a few. If students desire a deep and broad understanding of the Great Works, they must actively seek it out. Although Great Works-specific coursework is less available, however they do still exist. The Martin Center researched 48 academic programs that involve a close study of Great Books of Western thought. Although some of the programs in this report are not advertised as Great Books programs, their curricula include an in-depth study of core texts. Uniting these programs is a desire for wisdom and understanding, and the belief that engaging with the Great Books can aid in this pursuit.",

Taken together, those concepts comprise radical cultural left ideologies known as Critical Social Justice (CSJ). The findings of this report suggest that the teaching of applied versions of Critical Race Theory and radical gender theory is endemic in American schools. Ninety-three percent of a random sample of 18-to-20-year-old Americans say that they have been taught, or have heard about from an adult at school, one or more Critical Social Justice (CSJ) concepts. In fact, the average respondent reported being taught and/or hearing about more than half of the eight concepts this study measured. Even assuming these are overestimates, schools and teachers promoting CSJ narratives can hardly be regarded as rare or isolated occurrences. Rather, it is the experience of a large segment of American high school students, if not the majority.",

Nevertheless, gender inequalities persist and education remains elusive for many girls. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates that 11.2 million girls and young women may drop out or not have access to school due the pandemic. As the pandemic led to a surge in the use of digital technologies in education, it also revealed staggering gender gaps in access to and use of digital technology all around the world -- not just in contexts where there is no parity in education. Indeed, gender-based exclusion is present throughout the technological world. However, the pandemic showed that learning can occur anywhere and anytime. Innovative solutions are at our fingertips and we have an opportunity now to leverage global experience to deliver quality learning for girls, from high-tech to low-tech, to no-tech.

The purpose of this study is to identify student evaluations and satisfaction levels concerning the pedagogical dimension of distance education programs. The single screening model was used in this quantitative study. The criterion sampling method, one of the purposeful sampling methods, was used in determining the universities whose distance education system would be examined. The study population consisted of universities offering distance education in Istanbul; the study sample consisted of 5 universities, among universities with at least 3 years distance education experience, which offered at least one of the associate degree, bachelor's degree or master's degree programs online and which had various learning management systems. The satisfaction questionnaire, developed by the researcher, was used as the data collection instrument; the pilot study of the questionnaire was applied on 194 distance education program students. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was observed to be 0.988 and the questionnaire was accepted to be reliable. Data were collected from 533 students studying in the distance education programs in the universities within the study sample. Data collected from the questionnaire were analyzed through the SPSS (Version 20) software. Findings suggest that students find it necessary to develop distance education programs in course design and content, the teaching and learning process, educational materials, the support provided and assessment-evaluation. It is suggested that evaluating distance education programs in regular intervals and making improvements based on evaluation findings will enhance the quality of the education provided.",

In addition to highlighting the pay and size of the admissions workforce, the report focuses on time in position, diversity, and pay equity. Taken together, we find that colleges and universities have long relied on admissions positions with high turnover and young employees to do a great deal of the legwork of building the next graduating class. Trends in age and turnover were similar over time and not due to the Great Resignation. We argue that colleges and universities would benefit from considering how they could reconceptualize crucial admissions positions, particularly admissions coordinators and counselors, to encourage higher retention. Efforts to increase retention among admissions coordinators and counselors should be combined with a focus on recruiting and retaining people of color. Asian and Hispanic or Latina/o employees were underrepresented in admissions positions relative to U.S. bachelor's degree holders. In addition, the representation of people of color declined at each subsequent level of the admissions workforce, indicating gaps in the promotion of underrepresented minorities. Finally, the admissions workforce has many areas of strength in pay equity, with some notable exceptions. Hispanic or Latino men who were heads of admissions are paid only 87 cents on the dollar to White men who are heads of admissions. Further, 52% of chief admissions officers are Black or White women, yet they are paid less than White men. A pay equity analysis that includes market rate data would help identify areas for improvement at the institutional level.",

This risks reversing gains in women's participation in the workforce. This report seeks to call attention to the potential of STEM education to transform gender norms in the education system, to improve quality learning opportunities for girls, and to highlight key actions that can accelerate girls' transition between education and technical expert jobs in STEM industries. Critically, STEM education also has the potential to contribute to personal empowerment, transformation of communities and nations, and building economies for the future. The evidence presented here provides a foundation for a call to action for global, national and regional actors. The following questions are addressed: (1) How is the learning crisis affecting girls? (2) Why is STEM learning so important for girls? (3) What are the gender disparities in STEM education? (4) Why are girls under-represented in STEM? and (5) How can we transform opportunities for girls through gender-responsive STEM education? The document concludes with a call to action.

In this context, it was investigated to see whether there are any relations between student gender and the preferred agent gender; students' preference among agents with voices in different frequencies; and effects of the voicing technique on students' achievements. The post-test experimental model was used in the study and the study group consisted of 112 primary education students. Data collection tools of the study included pre-knowledge test; four educational software packages, in which agents having different voices and genders were used, and an achievement test. Multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA tests were used in analysis of data. At the end of the study, it was seen that the frequency used in voicing the pedagogical interface agents of the software did not have any significant effects on students' learning levels, and it was observed that students tend to choose the agents of their own gender, and that they prefer high-pitched voice for male agents and high-pitched voice for female agents.",

        "description":"Educational technology (EdTech) possesses comprehensive content and an accumulation of topics requiring extensive analyses for monitoring its development over time. Conducting comprehensive analyses facilitates acquiring a plural perspective instead of subjective experiences and facilitates focusing on the places where deficiencies occur in the field. This research aims to determine general EdTech research trends and to monitor its developments over time and investigates EdTech research from aspects such as year, publication type, country, journal, institution, author, scientific field, keywords, inter-country relationships, citations, and interactions using the bibliometric method. The study analyzes 135,835 EdTech publications published between 1950-2021 in 156 journals located in the EdTech Journals 2021 list and Scopus database and presents the findings under four headings: numerical development of EdTech research by year, content changes, relationships among the research, and research impact. The number of publications on EdTech research increased post-2000, with most being performed in the fields of social sciences and computer sciences, a large portion are composed of articles, and USA is prominent in the country rankings and coauthor analyses. When examining the common word analyses, the topics of interactive learning environments, learning-teaching strategies, pedagogical issues, virtual reality, and distance learning are prominent. The most-cited journals in EdTech research are Computers and Human Behavior, Computers and Education, and Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication. This study evaluates EdTech research's numerical, contextual, and impact trends and is thought to contribute to the framework formed for future EdTech research.

        "description":"In COVID-19 pandemic process, teachers paid effort to use Web 2.0 tools to make their classes interactive and more interesting in distance education. Central institutions have also planned and implemented various in-service trainings to support usage of technology by teachers. In the 2021-2022 academic year, distance education was terminated and face-to-face education was readopted. It can be argued that it is not acceptable to return to learning-teaching process in the classrooms without technology after two years of technology-based progress experienced with all the stakeholders of education. For this reason, it is important to make effective use of various web 2.0 tools in face-to-face education in order for students to experience and internalize technology as a teaching tool. In this context, the aim of this study is to reveal the opinions of social studies preservice teachers as regards the Plickers application that they experienced with secondary school students. Document analysis was used in the study. In this context, the reflective texts were used as a data source where 24 pre- service teachers shared their application experiences in the portfolios they prepared in the Information Technologies in Social Studies course. The obtained data were analyzed by document analysis consisting of review, detailed examination and interpretation steps. As a result of the study, it was determined that the preparation and application processes of Plickers were experienced as &quot;easy&quot; and that its advantages outnumber disadvantages.",

        "description":"The rising number of forcibly displaced persons (FDPs) and the growing duration of displacement have made building economic resilience a priority, particularly for young people. By 2019, the global population of FDPs had doubled to 80 million. The majority of FDPs (86 per cent) live in low- or middle-income countries where host communities are themselves affected by food insecurity, malnutrition and weak labour markets. Youth comprise a significant share of the forcibly displaced population. Half of all refugees are aged under 18, with young adults aged 18-24 constituting another 13 per cent of the total. In addition, there are nearly 10 million internally displaced persons between the ages of 15 and 24 full of hope but lack opportunities to realize their potential. Technology is playing a growing role to provide education, training and employment, including in humanitarian and migration responses. By driving a shift to online work and training on an unprecedented scale, albeit not universally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of digital technologies in programmes that support school-to-work transition, including solutions focused on youth who are FDPs, in host communities, or are otherwise vulnerable. This report, funded in part by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands' PROSPECTS partnership, provides an overview of how digital technologies are being used to support youth's transition from school to work, 'learning to earning', in displaced and host communities. Based on a rapid analysis of emerging approaches and lessons in this burgeoning space, the report's purpose is to inspire concerted attention and action to ensure effectiveness and scale of such digital enablers. [This report was partially funded through the Partnership for improving prospects for forcibly displaced persons and host communities (PROSPECTS), which is supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.

Worldwide, more than 4 out of 10 forcibly displaced persons are younger than 18, with 33 million children living in forced displacement at the end of 2019 -- either as internally displaced persons within their country or abroad as refugees or asylum seekers. Young migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) across continents represent a unique, untapped pool of talent, ideas, and entrepreneurship. Often resilient, motivated and with experience in overcoming adversity, they have the potential to help solve some of our greatest challenges. Powered by the voices of youth, this report harnesses the technology of U-Report to ask 8,764 young people on the move, aged between 14 and 24, if they felt heard and invited them to share their aspirations to learn and earn. According to this poll, nearly 40 per cent of young people on the move identify education and training as their biggest priorities, and 30 per cent prioritized looking for a job. As the examples in this report highlight, young people on the move are a force for success. But only by creating incentives and opportunities for them to fulfil their aspirations can we turn their passions, energy and hopes into something productive and empowering.",

The Department previously addressed sexual harassment only through guidance documents, which are not legally binding and do not have the force and effect of law. Now, the Department's regulations impose important legal obligations on school districts, colleges, and universities, requiring a prompt response to reports of sexual harassment. The Final Rule improves the clarity and transparency of the requirements for how schools must respond to sexual harassment under Title IX so that every complainant receives appropriate support, respondents are treated as responsible only after receiving due process and fundamental fairness, and school officials serve impartially without bias for or against any party.",

To better understand higher education outcomes for students with disabilities in Maryland, the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC), in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Disabilities and in partnership with the state's higher education institutions, created a survey administered to colleges and universities to collect these data in aggregate form. The information may be used to improve policies and practices to support the success of students with disabilities. In fiscal year 2021, 15,937 undergraduate students and 2,024 graduate students were registered with their institutions' disability services office as students with disabilities, which represents 4.0% of all students enrolled in fiscal year 2021, almost no change from the previous year. Specifically, this represents 4.5% of undergraduate students and 2.2% of graduate students enrolled. [For the 2022 edition of this report, see ED618780.]",

        "description":"Community colleges in the United States, which serve a disproportionate number of students from low-income backgrounds, can provide a valuable pathway toward well-paying careers. However, graduation rates at community colleges are very low--among first-time, full-time, degree-seeking students who enter public two-year schools, only 29 percent graduate within three years. Seeking to address this challenge, three community colleges in Ohio implemented a new comprehensive program model that was based closely on the City University of New York's (CUNY's) proven Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP). In 2015, the three Ohio colleges began implementing their programs and experienced similar successes as CUNY; the first phase of MDRC's study found large impacts on graduation rates and transfer to four-year institutions after three years. This brief extends the follow-up period for the Ohio programs to six years and provides earnings and employment impacts for the first time. After six years, the program continued to have an impact on graduation: 44 percent of students in the program group earned a degree, compared with 29 percent in the control group. Notably, these improvements in academic achievement have led to increased earnings, on average, for the students in the program group. In Year 6, students in the program group earned an additional $1,948 over the control group average of $17,626, an increase of 11 percent. These findings represent a new and important contribution to the growing body of evidence on comprehensive approaches (especially those modeled after CUNY ASAP) to improve the educational--and now economic--outcomes of students from low-income backgrounds. Future briefs will extend the follow-up period for academic outcomes to eight years and labor market outcomes to ten years. [For the supplement to this report, see ED627556.]",

        "description":"The Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD), established in 1920, has grown to serve 191,073 credit and 24,497 non-credit students. This report assesses the impact of MCCCD as a whole on the county economy and the benefits generated by the colleges for students, taxpayers, and society. The approach is twofold. It begins with an economic impact analysis of the colleges on the Maricopa County economy. To derive results, it relies on a specialized Multi-Regional Social Accounting Matrix (MR-SAM) model to calculate the added income created in the Maricopa County economy as a result of increased consumer spending and the added knowledge, skills, and abilities of students. Results of the economic impact analysis are broken out according to the following impacts: (1) impact of the district's day-to-day operations; (2) impact of student spending; and (3) impact of alumni who are still employed in the Maricopa County workforce. The second component of the study measures the benefits generated by MCCCD for the following stakeholder groups: students, taxpayers, and society. For students, an investment analysis is performed to determine how the money spent by students on their education performs as an investment over time. The students' investment in this case consists of their out-of-pocket expenses, the cost of interest incurred on student loans, and the opportunity cost of attending the colleges as opposed to working. In return for these investments, students receive a lifetime of higher earnings. For taxpayers, the study measures the benefits to state taxpayers in the form of increased tax revenues and public sector savings stemming from a reduced demand for social services. Finally, for society, the study assesses how the students' higher earnings and improved quality of life create benefits throughout Arizona as a whole. [For the Executive Summary, see ED627562.]",

        "description":"New York State's system of public elementary and secondary schools is in steep decline, but it is salvageable. The roots of its problems pre-date the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, but the system's response to that challenge accelerated discontent with the schools and harmed students. The damage of those years will not be undone if the state blindly continues to throw money at schools--unless there is a fundamental re-thinking of the purpose and governance of public education. New York consistently leads the nation in K-12 school spending, yet by 50-state standards, student outcomes are mired in the middle. If higher spending automatically led to higher quality, New York would be a model for the nation. Unfortunately, this model has demonstrably failed, and it is time for state leaders to fundamentally rethink their approach to education. This brief discusses: (1) the impacts of a change in the mayoral control of the New York City schools; (2) charter school outcomes; (3) the misguided college-for-all push; (4) and five areas in which the governor can lead a change in approach to education.",

It also determined the differences in the motivated strategies for learning and online readiness of the respondents when grouped according to sociodemographic characteristics. The respondents of the study were 153 purposively-sampled 2nd year to 4th year maritime students enrolled in the BS Marine Engineering and BS Marine Transportation programs. The descriptive-correlational research design was used in the study. The respondents' age ranged from 17 to 20 years old, the typical age of students who are in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years. Majority of the respondents were males because of the common notion that maritime courses are for males. Most were 4th year students enrolled in Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering. Motivated strategies of the respondents such as rehearsal, elaboration, organization, critical thinking, and metacognition showed high significant relationship with online learning readiness. This finding tends to suggest that the more the respondents use the different motivated strategies for learning, the more they are ready for online learning.",

In joint attention, a form of preverbal social communication, young children socially share attention with a partner about objects, a competency that is difficult for toddlers with autism. Video data of Interactions between caregivers and 61 toddlers with autism who received joint attention-focused intervention were analyzed to determine associations between turn taking and joint attention. Results indicate a positive relationship between the two forms of social communication.

        "description":"Globally, the number of refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs) has increased significantly over the past 10 years to reach unprecedented highs. Displacement from conflict and natural disasters, further exacerbated by climate change, has heightened the challenge and made it more pressing. Access to inclusive quality education for youth and adults is especially critical in the context of prolonged displacement. Literacy and numeracy are particularly important because they form the core of basic education. Literacy is also a crucial component of self-directed learning and the pursuit of opportunities to acquire skills and qualifications for work and to lead dignified lives. This report reviewed relevant literature and analysed 25 programmes from across the world that have used innovative information and communication technologies (ICTs) in literacy and education for refugees, migrants and IDPs. It identifies a lack of data on the state of literacy for youth and adults globally, and limited literature on the effectiveness of ICTs in supporting literacy and education programmes for refugees, migrants and IDPs. However, the 25 programmes reveal that ICTs play an important role in overcoming barriers to learning for these target groups. The strategies followed by these innovative ICT-supported programmes are elaborated across six thematic areas: (1) access and inclusion, (2) capacity-building of teachers and educators, (3) relevant content and innovative andragogy, (4) monitoring and evaluation, (5) strategic partnerships and (6) recognition, validation and accreditation of learning. Policy-makers, programme providers, international organizations, civil society, and, indeed, anyone with an interest in meeting the obligation to provide inclusive quality education for the most vulnerable, will benefit from the rich analysis and diverse examples included here. Together, they illustrate how technology can be used to support literacy and education programmes for refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons, using an evidence-based, learner-centred approach.",

This is important for migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) who seek to live and work in a dignified, safe and fair environment and to be engaged members of their new communities. The number of refugees, migrants and IDPs has grown considerably over the past 10 years. At the end of 2021, according to United Nations figures, there were approximately 27 million refugees and 53 million IDPs globally, while 2019 figures suggest that there are in the region of 272 million international migrants around the world. More open access to learning opportunities and high-quality learning materials can be created through the effective and meaningful use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as radio, television, mobile phones and personal computers, and more advanced technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence. Moreover, ICTs are already being used to improve health and intercultural understanding, language learning, literacy development, communication skills, and digital skills and competences. This compilation of 21 case studies highlights efforts from around the globe to use ICTs in innovative and effective ways to offer literacy and educational opportunities to young and adult refugees, migrants and IDPs. It will be useful to policy-makers, programme providers, international organizations, civil society and, in fact, anybody interested in implementing the commitment to offer inclusive, high-quality education to the most vulnerable.",

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to discuss to type and use of ICT Tools in various courses and evaluated the discernment on the usage of ICT Tools in teaching the courses in a Catholic school setting. The researcher used a descriptive cross-sectional design. It was conducted in a Catholic school The research instruments used to collect data included questionnaires for teachers and students were purely quantitative data and were processed using descriptive statistics. The Use of ICT tools in the teaching of History or Geography helps the teacher a lot in preparing and delivering the lesson to their students. However, the effective integration of ICT may be affected by several other concerns or factors.",

        "description":"The present study aimed to find out whether a course on multicultural education affect teachers' attitudes towards multicultural education, cultural differences, prejudices and democracy education. To this end, a one-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was employed. The sample of the study consisted of 20 teachers enrolled in a graduate program at a mid-sized public university in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey. The Democracy and Multicultural Education Attitude Scale (DMEAS) was administered both at the beginning and at the end of the 14-week multicultural education course. Wilcoxon signed-rank and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the pre-test and post-test scores, to analyze the differences based on gender, place of residence and years of experience. The findings of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores regarding attitudes towards multicultural education, cultural differences, prejudices and democracy education. In addition, Kruskal-Wallis results indicated a significant difference for the gender and place of residence variables for the posttest. However, the results of Kruskal-Wallis showed that there was not significant difference in terms of years of experience. Based on the findings, it can be said that a multicultural education course added to the curricula could significantly improve the multicultural attitudes of the teachers and reduce their prejudices.",

The Board Policy Statement on Developing Student Achievement Levels for the National Assessment of Educational Progress provides policy definitions of &quot;NAEP Basic,&quot; &quot;NAEP Proficient,&quot; and &quot;NAEP Advanced&quot; -- and describes the principles for setting achievement levels. The policy definitions are general, high-level expectations of what students should know and be able to do and consistent across all NAEP assessments. Content achievement level descriptions (ALDs) are specific descriptions of what students at each level should know and be able to do for each individual assessment as specified in the frameworks. The National Assessment Governing Board contracted with Pearson to design and implement a review of the achievement level descriptions (ALDs) for NAEP Reading and Mathematics assessments for grades 4, 8, and 12. This document describes the procedural and technical aspects and outcomes of the operational ALD Review study.

Assessment is the major aspect of the education system. The student assessment is the act of evaluating student's abilities and achievements. It is ongoing process and integral part of the teaching and learning process. The teacher makes judgments about the students learning or to determine student's interest through assessment. It helps the teacher to reflect on each student's level of achievement as well as to customize their teaching plans accordingly. After COVID-19 Pandemic the student assessment has been shifted more to the online assessment. The teachers have faced lot of issues due to lack of access of internet and technology. In every sphere of education there is a great impact of technology on the students learning that has been done after COVID-19. The present study was descriptive- survey based study. Both primary and secondary sources of data were collected. For the secondary sources of data the investigator had reviewed various national and international papers related with the present study. The sample comprised of 400 college students and 400 teachers from various degree colleges of Kashmir Division. Self- developed interview schedule and self-constructed were used for the data collection. The investigator has conducted a group interview of 10 college's students and 10 teachers separately that constituted of 80 interviews. On the bases of these 80 group interviews the researcher developed themes of all interviews and analyzed all these into specific themes. The investigator suggested some recommendations for improving the better assessment of students through remote learning. The study indicated that there are major six challenges in the context of online assessment i.e., lack of internet connection, language problem, parental attitude, mental disturbance, heavy work load and inaccessibility of smarts phones.",

Universities and Basic Education designed an alternative mode of learning that fits the regulations of the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19 (IATF). The researchers used a quantitative research design in collecting and analyzing the numerical data. Because it is the methodology that researchers use to test theories about people's attitudes and behaviors based on numerical and statistical evidence. Students' preferences in terms of the hybrid learning approach are with the in-person approach because they can easily understand and catch up with the subject being taught. The majority of students are still determined to have limited in-person or face-to-face classroom discussion. The most common challenges experienced by the students, being ranked accordingly, are the lack of appropriate devices and the interaction with teachers and students. According to Kohnke &amp; Moorhouse (2021), the utilization of various features of the video-conferencing software and other digital tools was seen as essential to the effectiveness of the HyFlex Learning Modality. That is why it is important for colleges to strictly monitor and strengthen the conduct of hybrid learning and follow the compliance set by the National Government Agencies.",

        "description":"This publication provides an overview of the literature on school safety in the United States, with a focus on equity. Using the framework developed by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), this publication situates a comprehensive school safety approach as a balance of three key elements: physical safety, school climate, and student behavior, with an emphasis on equity and the inclusion of knowledge gained from projects funded by the NIJ Comprehensive School Safety Initiative. The recent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the national outcry to address systemic racism have highlighted the continuing inequities that make schools unsafe for marginalized students. Systems must consider the experiences of these students and be intentional about implementing policies that balance the elements of a comprehensive school safety framework while also explicitly considering equity. For the purposes of this discussion, equity in school safety is defined as a system that not only considers but respects the varied and intersectional individual identities that students possess to ensure that they do not hinder their ability to feel safe at school and receive a fair education. The scope of this discussion will focus on the need for equity specifically relating to racial and ethnic identities.",

While the Markov chains methodology currently used by NCVER has demonstrated that it is reliable, with predictions aligning well with the actual rates of completion for historical estimates, it has not been reviewed for some time and it does have some limitations. The evaluation of machine learning techniques for predicting VET program completion rates was undertaken to overcome some of these limitations and with a view to improving our current predictions. This report includes: (1) an overview of the methodologies: Markov chains and two machine learning algorithms that were applied to predict completion rates for VET programs (XGBoost and CatBoost); (2) a comparison of the accuracy of the predictions generated by both methodologies; and (3) an evaluation of the relative strengths and limitations of both methodologies.",

Technological developments, which are closely followed all over the world, contribute to the improvement of communication between people at the same rate, and as a result of this information transfer process, individuals find the opportunity to express their feelings and thoughts on various media platforms. The use of this platform, which is called social media, has the feature of responding to the social needs of crowded masses consisting of all existing cultures and segments. Because of these reasons and needs, social media has a very important place in human life with its feature that brings together large masses. Foreign language learning activities have also developed through social media, and many foreign language lessons have become common on YouTube. Among these languages is Arabic, which is spoken by approximately 450 million people in the world. Arabic is one of the most widely taught foreign languages in our country. In this context, it is clear that social media, like other technologies, creates a suitable basis for the use of education in the Arabic teaching process. In this study, the opinions of university students about the use of YouTube, one of the social media tools, in teaching Arabic are included. 200 students studying in Arabic preparatory classes within higher education institutions participated in the research; His views on the Arabic lessons given on YouTube were examined. At the end of the study, Arabic preparatory class students; It has been revealed that they think that the use of YouTube in the Arabic teaching process is beneficial. As a result of the answers given to the open-ended question asked whether YouTube lessons are advantageous in teaching Arabic; It has been determined that YouTube Arabic lessons contribute to the students in the preparation process and course repetitions at school. Another result of the study is; It has emerged that the number of Arabic lessons given on YouTube is less than other languages, which is perceived as a serious deficiency by the students.",

Despite this gender parity in access, the pre-primary education system does not always deliver on its potential to tackle gender inequities and address harmful gender stereotypes while they are being absorbed by the youngest learners. As such, this research explores the ways in which pre-primary education can become more gender-transformative at a system level and presents 11 key strategies to support this goal. The strategies are organized around five interconnected action areas: planning and budgeting; curriculum; workforce development; family and community engagement; and quality assurance. These strategies can help governments and policymakers to proactively incorporate gender-responsiveness into the design and implementation of their pre-primary education policy and programming, following a system-wide perspective.

        "description":"Mainstreaming gender within pre-primary education is a priority in tackling gender-related inequalities from the early years. Such mainstreaming requires the commitment of a variety of stakeholders within the education system and beyond, including different units within education ministries, pre-service and in-service teacher training providers, teacher unions, other ministries, academia and civil society organizations. This brief presents key advocacy points and enabling conditions to support education ministries to engage these partners in the delivery of gender-transformative pre-primary education. Advocacy points are aligned with the five components of quality systems: planning and budgeting; curriculum development and implementation; workforce development; family and community engagement; and quality assurance.

        "description":"Children begin learning about gender stereotypes as early as age two. The pre-primary education system does not always deliver on its potential to tackle and address harmful gender stereotypes while they are being absorbed by the youngest learners. All components of the pre-primary system have a role to play in breaking down these stereotypes. This includes the teaching workforce, who play a crucial role in determining how the education system contributes to gender equality and whose actions can influence children's learning experiences and their personal gendered views and behaviour. This brief highlights key strategies and considerations to ensure the pre-primary workforce can be prepared to stop gender stereotypes from being perpetuated, and ways they can create a learning environment that is gender-transformative.

        "description":"The Government published its teacher recruitment and retention strategy in January 2019 in response to a growing teacher supply challenge in England. Four years since the publication of the teacher recruitment and retention strategy, and despite the increases in recruitment and retention that came about due to the COVID-19 pandemic, teacher supply in England remains in a perilous state. Failing to recruit and retain enough teachers has significant implications for school staffing and therefore for pupils' education and learning. This essay draws together the range of insights that the author has gained from a programme of research funded by the Nuffield Foundation. The essay discusses the implications of the research findings for teacher supply policy in England within the landscape in early 2023. The essay explores the key trends in teacher recruitment, retention and working conditions over the last decade, assessing what progress has been made in addressing the growing teacher supply challenge and where future policy attention could best be focussed to continue addressing the challenges.",

It shows that research is lacking in many critical areas: awareness and non-discrimination, protection, adequate standard of living, family and community life, and empowerment -- that represent critical areas of policy and programming in need of robust evidence to improve inclusion and participation. Specific areas overlooked include tackling harmful stereotypes, tackling abuse and violence and ways to reduce stigma; on improving accessibility to water, sanitation, hygiene, housing and food; and interventions that aim for children with disabilities to enjoy their right to be heard, to play and to have their views considered in all matters affecting them. Health research covers 3 in 4 of all studies in our EGM, but there is little evidence on improving access to general health services and accessibility for children with disabilities in healthcare settings. Inclusive education was moderately represented, but lacked the detail to understand how it was implemented or if inclusive education was effective in improving (or harming) academic outcomes, school readiness, graduation rates or the quality of educational services.

        "description":"The educational pathways of doctorate recipients in the United States differ in many ways by race and ethnicity. Despite steady growth in educational attainment, Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIANs) remain underrepresented among U.S. bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree recipients. The persistence of this imbalance has driven greater investment in initiatives focused on closing these gaps and the identification of best practices within successful academic programs. Extending prior analyses, this InfoBrief examines the baccalaureate origins of doctorate recipients from 2010-20 by citizenship status, race, and ethnicity. Black, Hispanic, and AIAN doctorate recipients from 2010-20 disproportionately earned a bachelor's degree from minority-serving institutions, underscoring the importance of these colleges and universities for enhancing the diversity of the U.S. research enterprise. Although most Black and Hispanic doctorate recipients earned a bachelor's degree from public colleges and universities, a higher proportion of Black and Hispanic students with undergraduate degrees from private colleges and universities went on to earn a research doctorate.",

Although the number of employed college graduates increased by 1.2 million (2.5%) between 2019 and 2021, the number of nonemployed college graduates increased by 2.5 million (17.9%). This large increase in nonemployment coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and signals important changes in the labor market for college graduates. This InfoBrief provides an overview of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the college-educated workforce, drawing on new data from the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG). In addition to collecting basic information on labor force status and earnings, the NSCG collects detailed information on reasons for nonemployment, access to various job benefits, participation in professional activities, and measures of job satisfaction. The 2021 cycle of the NSCG elicited additional information related to the pandemic, such as pandemic-related reasons for not working, presence of telework arrangements, and pandemic-related salary effects.

        "description":"Research and development spending by academic institutions totaled $89.9 billion in FY 2021, an increase of $3.4 billion (4.0%) from FY 2020 (table 1). R&amp;D expenditures funded from federal sources accounted for $3.0 billion of the total increase. Federally funded R&amp;D expenditures had not increased by $3 billion or more since FY 2011, when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 supplemented the flow of R&amp;D support dollars. University-funded R&amp;D expenditures were 2.1% greater ($459 million) than in FY 2020 due largely to several institutions' improved accounting of internally funded R&amp;D through new financial systems and reorganizations. Universities reported $149 million more in R&amp;D expenditures funded from state and local governments, an increase of 3.2% from FY 2020. R&amp;D expenditures funded by nonprofit organizations (-2.6%, -$150 million) and businesses (-1.3%, -$68 million) decreased, while R&amp;D funded by all other sources was virtually flat (0.2% increase, $6 million increase).

And five years after high school, treatment students had higher earnings (g = .079). Subgroup findings revealed no significant moderation effects of the treatment by income, race, gender, or achievement level. Prior quantitative studies have largely failed to consider the role of academic achievement, so that is an important contribution of this paper. Ours is also the first study we are aware of to examine the impact of dual enrollment on earnings. While awaiting future research replicating our achievement and earnings results, results suggest dual enrollment is a promising strategy for increasing postsecondary success and earnings after college.",

        "description":"Racial socialization, the process through which individuals learn about race and racism in society (Hughes et. al, 2006), begins in early childhood and continues throughout development. As young people try to make sense of the abundance of messages they receive about race (from home, friends, school, the media, etc.), nurturing spaces that allow them to unpack their racialized experiences are key for positive racial identity development and overall well-being. Not only do educators have a responsibility to provide such spaces for youth, but would also be remiss not to provide opportunities for students to critically examine how race and racism affects their lives. This brief addresses two concerns related to race talk in the classroom: (1) challenges and barriers for students, in particular high school aged youth, in talking about race; and (2) some tips and suggestions for educators who want to facilitate effective race talk.",

As academisation has progressed, the Government has promoted the formation of multi-academy trusts (MATs) (House of Commons Education Committee, 2017; Department for Education, 2022k). This report provides new insights into the current MAT landscape by investigating how the mainstream school system has evolved so far. It sheds light on the key potential considerations and challenges in either pursuing an all-MAT system or in maintaining the current status quo, although it does not consider whether the ambition for a MAT-led system is desirable in itself. Finally, the report explores the role of LAs within the current school system and their views on the recent academisation policy proposals.",

        "description":"Educational institutions operating during the COVID-19 pandemic are openly using the online learning modality. The online learning environment offers students sustainable learning while staying in their own homes. This learning modality helps teachers in educating students who are studying under them. However, online learning presented problems for both students and teachers, hence affecting the quality of learning and instructions. These problems include technical issues, connection problems, and access to learning materials. The study adopted the design theory of technology-based student-centered learning as an initial foundation to explore elements of the online student-centered learning environment. The study utilized a mixed method research design employing the parsimonious embedded design. San Isidro College served as the research locale and the college students enrolled during the first semester of the academic year 2021-2022 served as the respondents of the study. The quantitative date was treated using mean and ANOVA and the qualitative data were thematically analyzed. The study discovered that the students were satisfied on all eight factors: learning device, online discussion, online learning, learning community, instructors' characteristics, dialogue between instructor and students, timeliness of feedback, and effectiveness of feedback. Among the eight factors, the timeliness of feedback showed that the students were most satisfied while the instructors' characteristics ranked the lowest. Overall, the learners were satisfied with their online learning experience.",

Developing relevant and lasting systems for safe and supportive school environments requires communities, and the people and institutions within them, to be at the center. Tackling complex problems requires change within and across institutions and local systems and among the individuals working and living within them. Schools exist within communities. When a community is engaged in schooling, the entire school (including students and teachers) has expanded access to the resources offered by the community. The community also has an opportunity to deepen its investment in the outcomes of its youth.

High school students who have been physically hurt by a partner earn grades of C or D twice as often as grades of A or B. They are 25% more likely to drop out of high school than their non-abused peers. Over a lifetime, victims of dating abuse experience a 20% reduction in earnings, and are more likely than their non-abused peers to smoke, use drugs, become pregnant as a teenager, develop eating disorders, and consider or attempt suicide.

Some experts argue that shortages are localized, while others say that the lack of teachers is due to low unemployment and other factors. Regardless, school systems face big challenges with their teacher workforce, including finding enough teacher candidates and retaining the teachers they have, as well as filling specialized positions. These challenges require school systems to make changes to the role of the teacher. This brief identifies eight categories of strategies that school systems are using to reimagine their teacher workforce, then assesses the extent to which large and urban districts have adopted these strategies. Of the 100 large and urban school systems examined for this brief, 97 had strategies to address workforce challenges. But fewer than one in three of those districts were pursuing workforce strategies the authors would define as new or imaginative--and most focused on recruiting more candidates.",

        "description":"There is a large and long-standing gap in education outcomes between pupils from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers in England (EEF, 2018; Hutchinson et al., 2020). Although there is some evidence of improvement since 2011, the gap has widened recently, largely as a result of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic (Tuckett et al., 2022; Howard et al., 2021; Rose et al., 2021). The Government is committed to improving outcomes for disadvantaged pupils (HM Treasury, 2021). The disadvantaged pupils' attainment gap is a key metric to assess progress in narrowing the gaps between disadvantaged pupils and their peers. To discuss the implications and suggest the best ways forward, the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) convened a roundtable in summer 2022 of experts involved in policy and research on economic disadvantage and education. This followed on from prior research by NFER exploring these issues in detail. The roundtable discussion informed the development of three key policy recommendations: (1) The Government should explore the feasibility of establishing a household income-based measure of disadvantage for the future; (2) The Government should explore the feasibility of introducing a 'continuity measure' of disadvantage from 2024 onwards. This would be based on the underlying eligibility criteria for FSM, and remove the effect of the transitional arrangements; and (3) The Government should consider replacing the current rank-based disadvantaged pupils' attainment gap measure with a simpler metric based on average point scores.

The team's initial work for the SSLN was a series of listening sessions with representatives from school districts and community-based summer program providers across the state during winter 2022. In response to the primary concerns of SSLN members, the listening sessions were designed to gather information about the current state of partnerships, the barriers and challenges facing programs, and how statewide organizations could best support local programs. In addition, we were interested in knowing more about the configurations and benefits of summer programs, unique solutions for challenges, and perspectives about the feasibility of common data reporting about summer experiences. This report is organized in sections, which correspond to the major topics of the inquiry, and are designed to be self-standing for discussion purposes: (1) The Special Role of Summer and Out-of-School Programming in Youth Development; (2) Challenges, Barriers … and Some Partnership Solutions; (3) Keys to Partnerships; and (4) Roles for the State Education Agency.

Objectives of the study were:(i) Determine whether university students at SOED who study university entrepreneurship education have higher entrepreneurial tendencies such as need for achievement, need for autonomy, creative tendency, calculated risk taking, and internal locus of control than those who do not; (ii) Determine whether university students at SOED who study university entrepreneurship education have higher entrepreneurial intentions than those who do not; and (iii) At SOED, in UDSM, investigate the relationship between university entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intentions of university students. The hypotheses of the study were: 1.The mean of need for achievement for student-teachers at SOED who receive university entrepreneurial intentions are not significantly different from that of non-recipients; 2. The mean of need for autonomy for student-teachers at SOED who receive university entrepreneurial intentions are not significantly different from that of non-recipients; 3. The mean of creative tendency for student-teachers at SOED who receive university entrepreneurial intentions are not significantly different from that of non-recipients; 4. The mean of calculated risk taking for student-teachers at SOED who receive university entrepreneurial intentions are not significantly different from that of non-recipients; 5. The mean of internal locus of control for student-teachers at SOED who receive university entrepreneurial intentions are not significantly different from that of non-recipients; 6. The mean of total entrepreneurial intentions of student-teachers at SOED who receive university entrepreneurial education is not significantly different from that of non-recipients; and 7. There is no correlation between university entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intentions of university students at SOED, in UDSM, Tanzania. In this study, the correlation research design was used to answer the study's main research question. Correlation was tested using Point Biserial Correlation. There was no significant relationship between university entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intentions of university students at SOED, in UDSM, Tanzania. r[subscript pb] (34)=0.071, p=0.681. Only hypothesis 2 was rejected meaning that there was significance mean difference in terms of need for autonomy between student-teachers who study university entrepreneurship education and those who do not in this study. The respondents' entrepreneurial intentions were medium, with a mean of 31.78 out of a possible 54 on the Caird test. The majority were unlikely to launch an innovative, growth-oriented global company, but they may be able to express their entrepreneurial spirit at work as an intrapreneur or in their spare time through volunteer community projects. Further research should be conducted among student-teachers at SOED in UDSM to determine why there is no significant mean difference between recipients and non-recipients of university entrepreneurship education in the following entrepreneurial tendencies: need for achievement, creative tendency, calculated risk taking, and internal locus of control. Further research should be conducted among student-teachers at SOED in UDSM to determine why there is a significant mean difference between recipients and non-recipients of university entrepreneurship education in terms of need for autonomy.",

Measurement and evaluation, one of the most essential parts of education, has become more controversial with distance education. Contrary to traditional assessment and evaluation, online assessment and assessment is usually carried out as assignments, projects or online exams given to students through the learning management system. In the absence of a supervision mechanism or live supervisors in the learning management system, exams are conducted without supervision. This is where online exams are the most controversial. Many instructors find unsupervised exams insufficient in terms of reliability and validity. Contrary to these negative thoughts, some educators consider an essential opportunity for an effective online exam to be more flexible than traditional exams, to be reported in detail in a short time, and to prevent paperwork. In this research, online exams were evaluated comprehensively. In this context, the opinions of the lecturers were consulted. The research results carried out by qualitative methods were discussed with the studies in the literature, and some suggestions were presented.

Participation rates among White students are decreasing as rates among Latine and Asian American and Pacific Islander students increase, and Black student participation rates hold steady. Schools, districts, and communities must be prepared to address these two forms of segregation to ensure equity and success for all students. &quot;Advancing Racial &amp; Socioeconomic Diversity Playbook&quot; provides a comprehensive integration planning guide with tools to help build inclusive teams, analyze segregation in your district, and refine plans. The planning guide and worksheets offer teams opportunities to review racial and socioeconomic issues side-by-side and together.

        "description":"Given the influx of immigrants and refugees over the past several years, newcomer students are found in the classrooms of small towns, suburbs, and big cities across the country and they bring with them a world of culturally diverse experiences and knowledge. Newcomers face myriad challenges to adapt and succeed in their new home and schools. They must learn how to navigate a new culture socially, master a new language, and adjust to a new, and typically different, educational system. Many of these students enter our schools with little or no formal education or fluency in English. Some have fled terrible conditions in their homelands. Others are here without their families. Despite these challenges, all share dreams of being successful students and productive members in our communities, while remaining linked to their cultures and native languages as they become first generation Americans. To help make these dreams come true, we searched for &quot;bright spots,&quot; schools that offer promising and effective strategies for newcomers in K-12 classrooms. In this report, we focus on five very different schools that serve newcomers, each offering promising strategies, proven approaches, and fresh ideas that can benefit all educators, but especially those who work with immigrant and refugee students. We discuss curriculum and instruction, professional learning, school orientation, social-emotional and health support, and ways to partner with newcomer families and communities. We learn how newcomer schools assist students to adjust and thrive.",

Because 97% of the nation's landmass is considered rural, by definition these areas are sparsely populated and far from urban centers (United States Census Bureau, 2017). Although rural school districts are small--median enrollment is fewer than 500 students--the overall numbers are not: 28.5% of schools are rural and 9.3 million students attend them (Showalter, Hartman, Johnson, &amp; Klein, 2019). The well-being and success of rural students is a critical determinant of the well-being and success of the nation as a whole. However one of the commonalities connecting rural areas is a lack of access to services, infrastructure, and equitable policies and practices. This article provides an overview of how equity relates to rural America and its students and schools. It examines racial diversity, poverty, intersecting discrimination, resource allocation for schools, broadband connectivity, access to high-quality child care, health services, and other topics impacting families in rural areas.",

The research, conducted by the National Foundation for Education Research (NFER), builds on findings from a previous study (Rose et al. 2021) and tracks the same pupils who were in KS1 (Y1 &amp; Y2) during the first partial school closure, for a two further years, once in 2021/22 when they were in Year 2 and Year 3 and will again in 2022/23 when they are in Year 3 and Year 4. This report covers the results from the first year of the two-year follow up. Attainment outcomes of pupils in Year 2 and Year 3 in spring 2022, measured by NFER assessments of reading and mathematics, are compared with attainment outcomes for a representative sample of pupils assessed in 2019 and 2017 for Year 2 and Year 3, respectively--before the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the study utilises a repeated measures design such that the reading and mathematics outcomes from pupils in Year 2 and 3 were compared with their outcomes from the previous academic year, when the same pupils were assessed as part of the previous study whilst in Year 1 and Year 2 (Rose et al. 2021). In addition to measuring reading and mathematics attainment, the study also included a teacher measure of pupils' social skills for a sub-sample of twelve pupils within each year group in each school. Contextual information about school practices and any catch-up activities being undertaken with the pupils was also collected though a survey completed by 67 headteachers.

        "description":"Since districts are often competing with each other and other higher-paying professions for new hires, it is imperative to consider ways to better engage and appeal to candidates. For human resource (HR) professionals and administrators to improve their efforts, they need to know how to cultivate effective relationships with potential new hires. Relationship-based recruitment provides for more connection with a candidate than the typical application and interview process of recruiting and hiring. Through this &quot;high-touch&quot; recruitment process, districts build relationships with candidates before a job is posted so candidates can learn more about a district or particular school prior to applying. By establishing a relationship with potential applicants early in the recruitment process, district administrators and teachers also learn about the possible fit of the candidate. This brief was developed in collaboration with the Indiana Department of Education to outline best practices for cultivating relationships with potential new hires. It goes over relationship-based recruitment and what it looks like to have an ongoing relationship-based recruitment with potential new hires for districts.",

Educators must be careful they don't add to a student's trauma. School policies, including academic (e.g., tracking) and behavior (e.g., discipline), can carry implicit bias that can retraumatize a student. A trauma-informed approach encourages educators to recognize resilience in their students and continue to build on that resilience in the classroom. Rather than ask &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; educators can ask &quot;What has happened to you--and how can I help? In trauma-informed teaching, safety is the foundation for student success. Educators can use the everyday practices in this report to create safe and predictable learning environments. It is important to note, however, that multiple approaches will be needed due to the variety of traumatic experiences that student's face.",

        "description":"In 2012 there were approximately 80 million millennials and about 70 million baby boomers (Schawbel, 2012). Schawbel estimates that by 2025 three of four workers will be of the millennial generation. By 2041, which is during the lifetime of most millennials, America's population is projected to become majority Brown and Black (Kundu, 2014). Already in 2019, teachers of color are underrepresented in K-12 classrooms and are leaving those classrooms to pursue more lucrative and less stressful work experiences. Why is it important to have millennial teachers of color in K-12 classrooms? Egalite, Kisida, and Winters (2015) found that when students and teachers are of the same race, student achievement, as measured by test scores, improves, particularly at the elementary level. It is critical that classrooms have effective teachers that reflect the spectrum of diversity that exists in the world. Several factors have an impact on the recruitment and retention of millennial teachers of color: hiring and placement practices; school working conditions, and state legislative actions. This report shares several things can be done to increase the retention of millennial teachers of color in schools.",

        "description":"Due to the challenging and charged political climate of 2017, educators may feel that engaging students in conversations about race, culture, and other differences can only enflame tensions, rather than calm them. This is especially true in environments with young children, as we are inclined to think that approaching these topics will cause, rather than solve, problems for the educators themselves. However, it is important that schools be proactive in teaching young children to appreciate differences and diversity. Beginning at an early age, children can distinguish the physical features that define our societal construction of race, such as skin color, hair textures, and facial features. This report discusses ways to nurture positive attitudes toward these differences to ensure that children will develop an appreciation of these differences, rather than a fear of them.",

        "description":"Since its introduction in 2017, NFER has been contracted by Ofqual to develop, deliver and analyse the results of the National Reference Test (NRT) in English and maths. The NRT is administered annually and shows if student performance in English and maths at GCSE level has changed from year to year. The NRT results are based on analysis of data from a nationally representative sample of secondary schools. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted on the delivery of the 2021 NRT, with the testing window postponed until the summer term. In a normal year, the NRT would be administered in late February/early March. The 2021 NRT took place later and was administered in April/May. There was a smaller sample than in previous years. It should be noted that a slightly higher number of schools were drawn in 2021 to account for the possibility that fewer schools would be able to participate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the postponement of the test and ongoing impact of the pandemic resulted in many schools being unable to participate in the assessment. Given the lower participation rate for the NRT in 2021, there was more potential for bias in the sample to have an impact on the validity of the outcomes. Therefore additional checks were made on the representation of the sample. The analysis found that, although the precision of the outcomes was reduced by the smaller sample size, the outcomes can still be considered valid. The reduced precision was accounted for by wider confidence intervals around the estimates. The Results Digest provides summarised information of the key performance outcomes for 2021 and comparison with the performance in 2020 at each of the three grade boundaries. Furthermore, it includes more details on the performance of students taking part and the representativeness of the school sample. [For the 2020 report, see ED608768.]",

This study provides additional analysis of the NRT 2020 and 2021 data to explore whether different areas of the curriculum have been differentially impacted by the disruption to teaching as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This may highlight areas that were more difficult to learn at a distance, were given a lower priority than others, or required more explicit teaching of concepts and/or skills. Key findings include: (1) There was no evidence of any clear differences across the English curriculum areas, suggesting that performance on the NRT in 2021 was comparable to that of 2020 across all areas of the English curriculum assessed in the NRT; (2) Performance fell by a similar amount for all areas of the curriculum in mathematics between 2020 and 2021, suggesting that the disruption to teaching and learning caused by the pandemic did not have differential impact across the curriculum; and (3) The absence of a clear pattern in changes in performance at the curriculum level for English and mathematics is perhaps unsurprising given that the extent of COVID-19 pandemic-related disruption was variable at the school, class and even student level.

While controlling for changes in district and local labor market characteristics, the author estimates an overall turnover elasticity of -1.4 and shows that the effect is largest for inexperienced teachers, declines with experience, and disappears around 19 years of experience. Combining these results with what is known about the relationship between teacher value-added and experience, the author shows that paying teachers more improves student achievement through higher retention rates. The results also suggest that adopting a flat salary schedule may be a cheap way to improve student performance.

        "description":"Approximately 20 percent of the public school students in the City of Los Angeles attend a charter school. Los Angeles is home to the second-largest school district in the nation. The School Choice Demonstration Project research team has documented disparities between traditional public school (TPS) and charter school funding in Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) since the 2002-03 school year. Throughout these reports, TPS in LAUSD have consistently received more funding per pupil than charter schools in LAUSD--anywhere from 22 to 40 percent more. In 2013, the California Legislature changed the way public schools had been funded for the last 40 years by establishing the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), a funding mechanism intended to increase funding equity. In this report, the authors investigate the status of the TPS-charter school funding gap a year after the full implementation of the LCFF. The authors use official financial documents from the California Department of Education and LAUSD to account for every dollar TPS and charter schools received in the 2019-20 school year, including in-kind services. [Additional funding for this report was provided by City Fund.]",

At its best, higher education and &quot;college&quot; transforms students, equipping them with life-long learning skills, a degree in hand, and well-rounded academic coursework, experiences and advising to prepare for life and a career. Critical student issues, however, challenge this transformation by affecting their higher education experience, persistence (staying in &quot;college&quot;) and completion (finishing &quot;college&quot;). By default, then those issues matter the most. This report and the contents therein seeks to identify those critical student issues, as well as the challenges that institutions face when addressing them, and formulate recommendations at the institution and state/system levels that improve the student experience, persistence and completion. The context for the review and the process for issue identification are intentionally brief to elevate what matters most -- the critical student issues.

        "description":"Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) SCORE Academy is an alternative learning high school composed of two distinct programs. SCORE Academy Re-engagement (A) serves students who are 16 to 21 years old and need to earn between one and 10 credits toward graduation. SCORE Academy Reassignment (B) serves students who have been reassigned by the WCPSS Discipline Review Committee (DRC) in lieu of receiving a long-term suspension. This report evaluates each program's outcomes. Qualitative data collected from staff and students within each program show evidence of strong, positive relationships. An examination of credit accumulation across school years shows evidence of the program's established goals being partially met. SCORE Academy A students who were enrolled in the program for five months or less in 2020-21 or 2021-22 earned, on average, two credits, thereby meeting the semester goal. Students who were enrolled for more than five months did not, on average, meet the yearly goal of four credits earned. In 2021-22, most of the students (86%) in SCORE Academy B were enrolled for five months or less and earned, on average, two credits, missing the goal of three or more credits. The official graduation rates for SCORE Academy in 2020 (48.9%) and 2022 (44.0%) exceeded the goal of 40%, and five-year graduation rates were higher, hovering around 60%. SCORE Academy B students who returned to their base high schools had comparatively lower graduation rates with no added value in examining the five-year rate. Based on these findings, recommendations are given to improve program transparency and adjust program goals.",

In addition, this white paper sets an ambition to increase the national GCSE average grade in both English language and in maths from 4.5 in 20193 to 5, for all secondary school pupils by 2030. In this report it is estimated the economic returns associated with achieving these ambitions. To achieve the Levelling Up mission, around one in four pupils will need to make sufficient improvements in Key Stage 2 (KS2) attainment by 2030 to reach the expected standard. It is estimated that the size of the attainment improvement will need to be equivalent to 0.87 of a standard deviation, or around 10 months of progress.",

        "description":"The paper presents a first global investigation of the longer-term inequality implications of COVID-19 by examining the effect of school closures on the ability of children from different countries and backgrounds to engage in continued learning throughout the pandemic, and their implications for intergenerational mobility in education. The analysis builds on the data from the Global Database of Intergenerational Mobility, country-specific results of the learning loss simulation model using weekly school closure information from February 2020 to February 2022, and high-frequency phone survey data collected by the World Bank during the pandemic to assess the incidence and quality of continued learning during periods of school closures across children from different backgrounds. Based on this information, the paper simulates counterfactual levels of educational attainment and corresponding absolute and relative intergenerational educational mobility measures with and without COVID-19 impacts, to arrive at estimates of COVID-19 impacts. The simulations suggest that the extensive school closures and associated learning losses are likely to have a significant impact on both absolute and relative intergenerational educational mobility in the absence of remedial measures. In upper-middle-income countries, the share of children with more years of education than their parents (absolute mobility) could decline by 8 percentage points, with the largest impacts observed in the Latin America region. Furthermore, unequal access to continued learning during school closures across children from households of different socioeconomic backgrounds (proxied by parental education levels) leads to a significant decline in relative educational mobility.

The primary data from Pakistan incorporates two innovations related to measurement and sampling. On measurement, the paper develops and implements a battery of instruments intended to capture cognitive and socioemotional skills among young adults. On sampling, the paper uses a panel that follows respondents from their original rural locations in 2003 to their residences in 2018, a period over which 38 percent of the respondents left their native villages. In terms of their validity and reliability, our skills measures compare favorably to previous measurement attempts in low- and middle-income countries. The following are documented in the data: (a) more years of schooling are correlated with higher cognitive and socioemotional skills; (b) labor earnings are correlated with cognitive and socioemotional skills as well as years of schooling; and (c) the earnings-skills correlations depend on respondents' migration status. The magnitudes of the correlations between schooling and skills on the one hand and earnings and skills on the other are consistent with a widespread concern that such skills are under-produced in the schooling system.

In the best of times, teaching can be challenging and stressful. Starting in 2020--amidst COVID-19 and with a spotlight on inequities in the United States--school leaders, teachers, school staff, and families have attempted to balance physical safety, emotional well-being, and worthwhile learning. This toolkit is designed for teachers, their students, and the classroom. It offers strategies to manage mental wellness in the context of school and personally, and it gives methods to assist students and families with learning and well-being. Each section includes tools that teachers can directly apply to their own experiences. Studies show that when teachers prioritize their own well-being, their health improves, they are better able to create positive conditions for student learning, and their students' well-being improves. That's why this toolkit centers teacher well-being from its very first chapter. We invite you to treat this document like you would any toolkit: pick one tool at a time, think about it, try it out a few times, and if the tool yields some kind of benefit, continue to use it. Then gradually consider trying another tool, and so on. Self-care is not a race. Keep adding tools to your toolbox at a comfortable pace, and do what works for you.

        "description":"Across six Sub-Saharan African countries, grade 4 students of teachers who were hired after a free primary education reform perform worse, on average, on language and math tests--statistically significantly so in language--than students of teachers who were hired before the reform. Teachers who were hired just after the reform also perform worse, on average, on tests of subject content knowledge than those hired before the reform. The results are sensitive to the time frames considered in the analysis, and aggregate results mask substantial variation across countries--gaps are large and significant in some countries but negligible in others. Analysis of teacher demographic and education characteristics--including education level or teacher certification--as well as teacher classroom-level behaviors reveals few systematic differences associated with being hired pre- or post-reform.

The report summarizes findings on how well information about international students' initial curricular pathway (English or ESL), level of placement in the pathway, and ESL placement test score(s) can predict their throughput in gateway English. It specifically focuses on the value of different commonly used ESL placement tests to this process, including the Combined English Language Skills Assessment (CESLA) and multiple types of ACCUPLACER tests. It begins with key findings from this research followed by a description of the research methodology. Then, it offers a detailed analysis of the predictive validity of different ESL placement tests for students' throughput. It concludes with high-level recommendations based on these findings. The report is intended to support the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office (CCCCO) and other educators and policymakers involved in development education reform in their decision-making about ways to continue supporting the success and completion of English learners in the system.",

        "description":"Nearly all states in the United States (45) currently have a postsecondary attainment goal to improve the average education levels of their residents and develop a highly-educated workforce. During a time of accelerated COVID-19 related postsecondary enrollment declines, the question as to how states will meet these goals could be particularly pertinent. While the National Student Clearinghouse's latest enrollment report provides encouragement that these unusually large declines are stabilizing, it is still uncertain when and how higher education will be able to rebound. Re-engaging with the Some College, No Credential (SCNC) population--the former students who stopped out without earning a credential--has been a priority for the many states with these established attainment goals. To succeed in bringing them back into higher education, state and institutional leaders need accurate and timely information about the current SCNC population, their progress, and outcomes upon re-enrollment, which is the focus of this annual progress reporting of SCNC students. This year's report suggests that there is an increasingly missed opportunity for states and institutions to re-engage with SCNC students even as the SCNC population is growing. Between July 2020 and July 2021, the U.S. has added 1.4 million more SCNC students; the SCNC population is now 40.4 million, up 3.6 percent from 39.0 million a year earlier. However, during the latest academic year 2021/22, fewer SCNC students re-enrolled, completed a credential, or persevered to a second year of re-enrollment than they did the previous year.

        "description":"In June 2021, the Minnesota Legislature appropriated significant investments in child care, using $537 million in Child Care and Development Funds from the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARP). Investments included: $304 million in direct payments to providers through Child Care Stabilization Grants; $22.5 million for Child Care Facility Grants for facility improvements, minor renovations, and related equipment and services; and $1 million for the Retaining Early Educators through Attaining Incentives Now (REETAIN) program. This money was temporary and provided much needed relief, as well as a unique opportunity to try novel approaches to solving a variety of challenges that exist in early education. The goal of this project is to understand the impact of ARP funds on increasing wages and retention of the early childhood education workforce to inform future investments. This brief explores the initial impact of that federal funding on Minnesota's child care industry. Ongoing analysis will further determine the impacts on the early childhood workforce; an in-depth report will be forthcoming in 2024.",

        "description":"Education officials have long hoped that the statewide academic assessments most students take each year could be used not only for accountability but also to guide instruction. Congress established the Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority (IADA) program in 2015 to help address this goal, offering up to seven states temporary flexibility from federal testing requirements so that they may more easily make progress toward replacing their current assessments with more innovative ones. The key incentive to participate in IADA is that students trying out the innovative assessment are not required to also take the state's current assessment. However, states approved for IADA must still show that their innovative assessments meet most requirements for federal accountability, and they are expected to implement the new assessments statewide within 5 years. This report describes the progress of the first five assessment systems approved under IADA in order to help policymakers consider expanding the program to more states. The report is primarily based on an analysis of states' IADA applications and performance reports to the U.S. Department of Education through the 2020-2021 school year and is part of a broader evaluation of IADA required by Congress.

        "description":"The California Community Colleges (CCC) began implementation of AB 705 in fall 2018, ensuring that most students started in transfer-level math rather than a developmental education sequence. The RP Group's Multiple Measures Assessment Project (MMAP) has found that for all student groups, dramatically increasing access to transfer-level math courses corresponds with significantly improved completion of these courses within one year. These outcomes exceed all rates exhibited in the past when students largely began in basic skills offerings. At the same time, course success has decreased at varying rates across colleges, resulting in a perceptual &quot;paradox&quot; of one key indicator increasing (throughput) as another decreases (course success rates). Further, educators, advocates, and policy makers alike have hoped that increased access to transfer-level courses would lead to greater alignment between the state's high schools and community colleges in math pathways, with students taking the next step beyond their high school learning rather than repeating courses they already completed. However, with implementation varying across the state, it is unclear to what extent colleges are intentionally placing students into math courses that build on and advance their high school learning rather than duplicating content and revisiting skills. To better understand these issues and the impact of AB 705 on how students transition from high school to community college in math pathways, MMAP compared CCC students' math placement and initial course completion in fall 2016 (pre-AB 705 implementation) to fall 2021 (post-implementation). This brief provides a summary of this comparison, updating research previously released by The RP Group showing data through fall 2019.

Congress established the Innovative Assessment Demonstration Authority (IADA) program in 2015 to help address this goal, offering up to seven states flexibility from federal requirements so that they may more easily make progress toward replacing their current assessments with more innovative ones. The report describes the early progress of the first five IADA systems to help policymakers consider expanding the program to more states. The report is primarily based on analyses of states' IADA applications and annual performance reports through the 2020-2021 school year and is part of a broader evaluation of IADA required by Congress.

        "description":"In 2016, Wake County Public School System (WCPSS) senior leadership determined that students were not consistently engaged with content, instruction, or tasks that support the specific instructional shifts in the North Carolina State Standards and 4Cs (communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity). After an internal review process, the district decided to adopt the EL Education curricula for Grades 3-8, Open Up Resources (OUR) for Grades 6-8, and the Mathematics Vision Project (MVP) for Math 1, 2, and 3. This report describes the implementation and goal outcomes of these curricula based on teacher and student survey data, as well as interviews with program staff across all grade levels. Generally speaking, teachers considered the new curricula to be of high quality, albeit many had concerns about their appropriateness for some students (e.g., struggling students, English Learners, etc.). Teachers consistently agreed that the new curricula gave all students ample opportunities to develop the 4Cs, and most believed they were able to implement their new curriculum with fidelity. Over time, teachers became increasingly comfortable in their ability to differentiate instruction within their new curriculum and felt less of a need for additional training and support. Most agreed that the resources provided by the district were valuable in supporting student learning, and that the implementation of the initiative had a mostly positive effect on students' outcomes. This report concludes with a discussion of the lessons academic staff have learned from the curricula rollouts, acknowledges how unforeseen challenges were handled, and makes recommendations for moving forward with future curricula rollouts. Recommendations include allowing adequate time for the rollout, involving all stakeholders, providing adequate time for students and staff to make adjustments, developing mindset shifts, providing ample supplementary resources to teachers, and developing a comprehensive strategy to rebuild and sustain the professional development infrastructure.",

High-quality trusts deliver for children in their schools and in their wider communities, as civic institutions acting in the public interest. This review has considered the regulatory oversight that the Department sets for trusts, the choices it makes about how the school landscape evolves, the support it offers to executive and non-executive trust leaders, and how it can best work with other actors in the system. Chapter 1 sets out how we will revise and consolidate our regulatory approach so it is more proportionate, effective and risk-based, delivering regulatory oversight in a more strategic manner. Chapter 2 sets out how we will reform our approach to commissioning to recognise trust quality better. Chapter 3 sets out how the Department will continue to support a transition to a dynamic, self-improving system, by sharing effective and tested practices, supporting trust improvement, establishing peer-to-peer networks and creating new professional development courses and qualifications.",

In light of this, the current study examines the prevalence of trauma experiences and traumatic stress in middle school students from a large urban school district serving a high proportion of diverse immigrant and low-income families. Descriptive statistics document the mean reported number of trauma experiences and posttraumatic stress subscale scores by participants' sociodemographic variables. Inferential statistics report significant differences associated with race/ethnicity, gender, and type of trauma--including exposure as a victim or a witness. Results show complex and significant racial/ethnic group differences in the experience and symptomatology of trauma among the entire screened sample as well as the subset of youth with elevated distress. Furthermore, findings document the predictive value of particular trauma events related to early adolescents' severity of self-reported traumatic stress. These in-depth findings underscore the need for routine, school-based screening to identify and bring culturally-competent, trauma-informed support and interventions to middle school students experiencing traumatic stress.

        "description":"This paper presents credible and comparable evidence on intergenerational educational mobility in 53 developing countries using sibling correlation as a measure, and data from 230 waves of Demographic and Health Surveys. It is the first paper to provide estimates of sibling correlation in schooling for a large number of developing countries using high quality standardized data. Sibling correlation is an omnibus measure of mobility as it captures observed and unobserved family and neighborhood factors shared by siblings when growing up together. The estimates suggest that sibling correlation in schooling in developing countries is much higher (average 0.59) than that in developed countries (average 0.41). There is substantial spatial heterogeneity across regions, with Latin America and Caribbean having the highest (0.65) and Europe and Central Asia the lowest (0.48) estimates. Country level heterogeneity within a region is more pronounced. The evolution of sibling correlation suggests a variety of mobility experiences, with some regions registering a monotonically declining trend from the 1970s birth cohort to the 1990s birth cohort (Latin America and the Caribbean and East Asia and Pacific), while others remained trapped in stagnancy (South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa). The only region that experienced monotonically increasing sibling correlation is the Middle East and North Africa. The recent approach of Bingley and Cappellari (2019) is used to estimate the share of sibling correlation due to intergenerational transmission. The estimates show that when the homogeneity and independence assumptions implicit in the standard model of intergenerational transmission are relaxed, the estimated share is much larger. In the sample of countries, on average 74 percent of sibling correlation can be attributed to intergenerational transmission, while there are some countries where the share is more than 80 percent (most in Sub-Saharan Africa). This suggests a dominant role for parents in determining the educational opportunities of their children. Evidence on the evolution of the intergenerational share, however, suggests a declining importance of the intergenerational transmission component in many countries, but the pattern is diverse. In some cases, the trend in the intergenerational share is opposite to the trend in sibling correlation.

        "author":["Hayward, Craig",
          "Newell, Mallory"],
        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic required that virtually all in-person instruction move suddenly to an online format. Given the unprecedented nature of this disruption, the California Community Colleges (CCC) issued an emergency regulation allowing all students to drop spring 2020 courses without incurring a withdrawal or &quot;W&quot; notation on their transcripts. Instead, they received an Excused Withdrawal or &quot;EW&quot; notation, which shields students from possible negative repercussions of a W notation on their transcript. The EW is not factored into academic progress calculations, and it is treated as if the student never enrolled in the course. However, an EW still indicates an unsuccessful attempt to complete a class, and a student who receives this notation will need to retake the course in a future term, if the course is required to fulfill their educational goal. The Multiple Measures Assessment Project (MMAP) historically included EW notations as indicators of non-successful course attempts in the calculation of throughput and course success in our research papers, within the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office (CCCCO) Gateway Completion Transfer-Level Dashboard, 2 and AB 705 compliance reporting templates. Given this changing context, MMAP examined how including or excluding EWs impacted the calculations of students' throughput in transfer-level English and math courses. Further, some educators are concerned about how this policy shift will specifically influence the proportion of students receiving an EW in a transfer-level math course, and how students' increased use of EWs may affect success and throughput rates within math pathways. In turn, the authors additionally examined the distribution of non-passing grades of students in their first gateway math course over time to shed light on the emerging impact of EWs on math throughput. This report summarizes these results for system-level leaders and college educators to support decision-making about equitable placement and completion in the CCC system.",

        "description":"By the time children in low- and middle-income countries start primary school, large socioeconomic disparities are evident in children's learning and development. Both pre-primary and home environments can play important roles in influencing school readiness and can contribute to disparities in early childhood development, but there is limited evidence on their relative roles in low- and middle-income countries. This paper examines how pre-primary quality, stimulation at home, and early childhood development vary by socioeconomic status for pre-primary students in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The results demonstrate substantial socioeconomic inequality in stimulation at home, more so than in pre-primary quality and inputs, although there is variation in the degree of inequality across different dimensions of pre-primary quality. &quot;Double inequality&quot; is observed, where students with less stimulating home environments experience slightly lower quality pre-primary inputs. There are particularly large pre-primary inequities in structural quality (physical environment) and less inequity in process quality (pedagogy). These results suggest that targeted investments in pre-primary education in Egypt are necessary to reduce inequality in school readiness but are likely insufficient to close the socioeconomic status gap in children's development. Investing in interventions to improve vulnerable children's home learning environments, as well as investing in quality pre-primary, is critical to address disparities in children's development.

        "description":"The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between social media usage behaviors of primary school teacher candidates and their social media addiction levels. The study was designed using relational screening model. The study group is composed of 230 primary school teacher candidates from the education faculty of a state school in the school year of 2018-2019. With a view to establishing differences between the groups, independent sampling t-test and ANOVA test were used, and Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between the variables. Data obtained through the analysis suggests that while there is a significant difference between the groups in terms of the variables of gender, duration of daily social media use and frequency of daily social media account check, no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of social media addiction based on year grades. In addition, the outcome of the correlation analysis demonstrates a weak positive correlation between the respective social media account and the level of social media addiction and a moderate positive correlation between the number of stories posted from social media accounts per month and the level of social media addiction. The findings were discussed throughout the article and some suggestions were offered.",

One control and three treatment groups were assessed on how literacy and reading habits changed when households were provided a variety of high-quality and low-cost early reading materials along with varying degrees of encouragement toward building better reading habits. The findings show that providing books in isolation was not enough. Rather, books in conjunction with a network of reading supports was found to be an effective means to boost reading outcomes, including reading proficiency measures, frequency of reading, and attitudes toward reading. The results highlight the need for at-home reading materials in poor households as an integral step to improve early reading. [This paper is a product of the Education Global Practice.]",

Students who were considered academically &quot;average,&quot; based on previous grades and test scores, and who often came from low-income and minority households that lacked a history of college education, were recruited into the AVID program. Students could take up to six AVID courses taught by teachers who were trained to use the AVID curriculum and other teaching materials to help students improve study and critical thinking skills. In addition to taking the AVID course, AVID students were placed in more challenging courses, such as honors and Advanced Placement (AP) courses.

The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of virtual reality in the acquisition and maintenance of pedestrian skills for children with intellectual disabilities. In addition, the effect of virtual reality on participants generalizing their pedestrian skills to real environments has also been examined. In the study, social validity data were collected from the participants and their mothers regarding the results of the study. Three intellectual disabled children between the ages of 11 and 15 participated in the study. In the study, a multiple probe design with inter-participant probe trial, which is one of the single-subject research models, was used. It is seen that all participants learned pedestrian skills and continued the skills they learned one, three and five weeks after the completion of the instruction. In addition, all participants were able to generalize their skills to the real environment (pedestrian crossing and illuminated pedestrian crossing). When the social validity data collected from the participants and their mothers were examined, it was revealed that teaching with virtual reality applications is interesting and fun, in addition, it can be used for different educational purposes.

The primary focus of an OEYP is to reduce and ultimately eliminate the need for student grade-level retention by providing additional instructional time for students to master the state's academic performance standards. OEYP activities occur outside the regular school day. OEYP is designed to accommodate four school-day options: (1) extended day, (2) extended week, (3) intersession for year-round schools, and (4) summer school. A school district may provide instructional services during any of these programs for a period of time not to exceed 30 days. Participating students must receive a minimum of 240 minutes of instruction to meet Texas Education Agency (TEA) reporting requirements. Since 1993, the Austin Independent School District (AISD) has used the OEYP to reduce the number of AISD students at risk of academic failure.

This year's report maintains the Career Cluster structure, grouping occupations and aligned training programs in one place. Accompanying dashboards and data downloads are also available for readers who prefer to work with the data directly. This report includes a few new features, including a revised approach to measuring degree completers' employment and wages, as well as a simplification of report layout to improve readability and flow. Multiple state agencies facilitate this report's completion and there are many audiences for this report. Each year, efforts to refine and improve the report and associated outputs will continue to ensure the report is useful in education and workforce planning. This report: (1) Identifies in-demand occupations and aligned academic programs at the postsecondary and secondary levels as well as registered apprenticeships organized across 14 career clusters; (2) Includes in-demand occupations tables identifying the number of region(s) where the occupation is in-demand, entry level wages, indicators for jobs which are STEM fields and those which support TNECD's target industries, and the typical training level required for employment; (3) Contains aligned academic programs tables with information about degree production and completers, matriculation into Tennessee's job market, and first-year wages for those identified in Tennessee employment data. The calculation for employment outcomes changed in this year's report; (4) Spotlights select agency initiatives promoting education and workforce alignment in K12, higher education, and the workforce; and (5) Offers an overview of data, methods, and sources highlighting existing data use and areas for further exploration.

        "description":"The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Success initiative at the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) is dedicated to strengthening the capacity of Tennessee's seven historically Black colleges and universities to provide the highest quality education; increasing opportunities for these institutions to participate in and benefit from State programs; and ensuring that Tennessee has the highest proportion of college graduates from HBCUs in the country. The 2022-25 three-year strategic plan for HBCU Success has been developed through a process of research, collaboration, and consensus gathering, with vital input from stakeholders across the Tennessee HBCU Sector. In developing this strategic plan, it was important to not only address each of the HBCU Success statutory directives, but to do so in a way that optimized and maximized the synergy between the Commission, the HBCU Success Advisory Board, THEC staff, and the broader higher education sector. Recognizing the diversity in institution types and their needs, the strategic plan seeks to chart a path forward that is both flexible and adaptive to the changing operating context of Tennessee's HBCUs. The 2022-25 HBCU Success Strategic Plan is built on strategic pillars: (1) Promote Tennessee HBCUs to students, families, the community, and policymakers; (2) Support the strengthening of the administrative capacity at Tennessee HBCUs; (3) Encourage partnerships with Tennessee HBCU programs and initiatives; and (4) Explore new ways of improving the relationship between the state and HBCUs.",

This role can include support of a student related to academic coursework, registration, housing, financial aid, health and/or other services. Typically, SPOCs are supportive campus administrators who are committed to helping students from foster care or homelessness address and overcome challenges associated with foster care, housing insecurity and other basic needs. SPOCs can serve in various roles within different campus offices, but should be in a position to facilitate communication and quickly refer students to other offices and resources, on campus and off. Overall, SPOCs assist college students who have experience with foster care or homelessness in reaching their postsecondary goals. This Single Point of Contact feasibility report provides: (1) a profile of foster and homeless youth; (2) existing efforts in Virginia to support foster and homeless youth; (3) efforts in other states; and (4) conclusions regarding the feasibility of having points of contact at public institutions.",

        "description":"The Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework (EYFS) statutory framework sets the standards and requirements that all early years providers must follow to ensure all children have the best start in life and are prepared for school. This includes the requirements for staff: child ratios for all providers delivering the EYFS and the qualification levels that practitioners must hold in order to count within the ratios. The EYFS framework was updated in 2021, the main focus of the changes were on learning and development and assessment requirements with the primary aim of improving outcomes for children. This consultation asked for views about the suitability of the proposed revisions to the Early Years Educator Level 3 qualifications criteria and any cost implications of changing the criteria on businesses. The Early Years Educator Level 3 criteria set out the minimum expected standards for what a practitioner qualified to Level 3 should know, understand, and be able to do when delivering the Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework (EYFS). The consultation was conducted online over an 8-week period from Monday 28 November 2022 to Monday 23 January 2023, with the option to respond by email. All responses were received via the online form. The consultation questions requested yes/no/not sure answers, as well as free text, allowing respondents to express views on the proposed criteria. This review contributes to the Early Years Recovery Programme (EYRP) by updating and improving the Early Years Educator Level 3 criteria, responding directly to sector feedback on the need for improving the quality of Early Years Educator Level 3 qualifications.",

        "description":"Purpose: The objective of this study is to determine Education in the Digital World: from the lens of millennial learners. This also identifies the cybergogical implications of the issue with digital education as seen through the lens of the outlier. Method: This study uses a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. A quantitative method was employed during the first phase and the instruments of the study were distributed using google forms. The survey received a total of 85 responses and the results were analyzed using descriptive methods. Following up with a qualitative method, during the second phase the outliers were interviewed, and the results were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results of the mixed methods were interpreted in the form of cybergogical implications. Results: The digital education from the lens of millennial learners in terms of the Benefits of E-Learning and Students' Perceptions of E-Learning received an overall mean of 3.68 which was verbally interpreted as &quot;Highly acceptable&quot;. The results reveal that millennial learners' perceptions of digital education are influenced by the convenience in time and location, the fruit of collaboration using online interaction, the skills and knowledge they will acquire using digital resources, and the capability of improving themselves for the future. Conclusion: E-learning significantly improves the quality of the learning and teaching process. Millennial learners with different learning styles and speeds were addressed by its usability and portability features. Millennial learners were able to adopt and learned how to use e-learning. Also, since it is self-paced learning, it allows them to study on their own time and schedule since e-learning can be accessed anytime and anywhere. However, the technological resources of the learners should be considered in the implementation of e-learning. Recommendations--The utilization of e-learning as a medium of instruction for millennial learners. Research Implications--The findings can be used by the institution to create guidelines, procedures, and policies for successfully implementing digital education or E-Learning.",

        "description":"Increasingly, obtaining a job that pays family-sustaining wages means getting a college degree or other postsecondary credential. However, according to the 2021 U.S. Census, only 31.5 percent of Texans ages 25 and older have a bachelor's degree or higher. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB)--the highest authority in the state regarding public higher education--has therefore set out a strategic plan to increase that percentage. Specifically, the plan calls for 60 percent of Texans ages 25 to 64 to have a postsecondary credential &quot;of value&quot; by 2030. THECB seeks to improve student outcomes by promoting a variety of student success interventions, particularly corequisite models. To meet this goal, THECB is giving grants to colleges across the state to fund student success programs: programs designed to help more students stay in college and earn degrees, particularly students of color, students from lower-income backgrounds, and students who need additional assistance to make satisfactory academic progress (that is, to earn enough credits to keep their federal financial aid). This brief summarizes some of the information THECB and its partners will use in that effort. It describes best practices and programs with proven effectiveness--the information that policymakers and practitioners need to consider in designing and promoting student success programs. The findings are based on MDRC's 20-year history conducting rigorous evaluations in postsecondary education as well as research and evaluations by other researchers. [This brief was funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education, Education Stabilization Fund Program Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund, as part of the THECB Student Success Acceleration Program Implementation Grants.]",

        "description":"Each year, millions of students enroll in open-access two-year colleges with the hope of earning skills, training, and most importantly, a degree that will allow them to pursue their goals, including transferring to a four-year institution. Developmental, or remedial, education has been found to present multiple barriers to two-year student success. These courses often prolong students' time toward transfer to four-year institutions by stalling students' progress toward achieving their academic and vocational goals. Using data from interviews with eight transfer professionals across the U.S. and its territories, this study investigated relationships between transfer support services and developmental education courses at two-year schools. More specifically, it sought to understand how transfer planning and advising are embedded within classroom content and how course activities support students' transfer. Findings reveal that transfer is often unconsidered in developmental course planning and that several factors, including resource and staff limitations and academic freedom, impact how, and the extent to which, transfer is included in developmental courses.",

Thus, this developmental research aimed to develop and test supplementary learning material in the form of interactive modules. The study was anchored on a Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and the framework for designing instructional solutions to achieve desired learning outcomes. The ADDIE model was used to design and develop the supplementary learning material. The data pertinent to the study were tabulated, analyzed, and interpreted using computing the weighted mean, and each data were provided a descriptive interpretation. Results revealed that learners had developed a positive perception of E-learning. The developed supplementary learning material conforms to the requirements of the Department of Education in terms of Content Quality, Instructional Quality, Technical Quality, and other findings, including conceptual, factual, grammatical, and typographical errors. It was also found to be suitable to serve as an intervention learning material that will help learners achieve the desired learning outcome.",

As schools increasingly struggle to find an adequate number of diverse, well-qualified teachers to fill their staffing needs, states are under pressure to open up new pathways for becoming a teacher or to modify existing ones. To help teacher preparation and credentialing leaders, policymakers, researchers, and even prospective teachers, gain a clearer view of the state and national landscapes for earning a first-time teaching credential, we have created a first-of-its-kind public database detailing the attributes and requirements of each available state pathway into teaching. The database shows how state teacher preparation policies intersect with policies that determine who can obtain employment as a lead classroom teacher--an often overlooked but critical aspect influencing the quantity, diversity, and quality of the novice teacher workforce. This resource can guide reflection and innovation as states seek to balance the inherent tensions between quantity, quality, and diversity that are present when shaping pathways into teaching and determining if and how teachers entering via these pathways can progress once in the profession.",

        "description":"The aspects of the de jure or overt language policy attract many researchers, which is reasonable given the importance of legislation in nation-building. Scholars also pay attention to the de facto and covert language policies, which include informal and non-written aspects of language policy that can shed light on practical problems on the grassroots level. In the selected context, relying upon only one aspect would lead to an incomplete understanding of the subject since there is usually a gap between Kyrgyzstan's de jure and de facto language policies. Therefore, this thesis approached the topic considering both aspects. Such an inclusive study produces thick material for analysis and increases the validity of conclusions by triangulating data from different sources. This study aimed to answer the following research questions: 1. What LP has been implemented in Kyrgyzstan? 2. How has LP affected the target group? 3. What language attitudes and beliefs currently prevail in the target group? The first research question was assessed using Tollefson's historical-structural approach based on analyzing legislative documents, historical materials, university websites, and dissertation catalogs. These methods helped identify the reasons that significantly contributed to the failure of constructing the Soviet identity in Kyrgyzstan. The reasons included covert, implicit, and vague policies, which have driven the de jure and de facto language policies in different directions. Hopefully, the findings of this thesis will shed some light in these directions by raising awareness among leaders and people about the sources of the problem. The second and third questions required in-depth interviews and surveys since many answers to these questions are only sometimes available online. They can only be studied through direct access to primary sources. Data from 850 participants, including 82 in the pilot study and ten expert interviews, show that previous language policies have created many problems that participants must overcome. These problems lie in the participants' divergent perceptions of their identities and mutually exclusive beliefs in decisive aspects of nation-building, often resulting in discrimination based on their demographic characteristics. Further research on the effect of faculties' international experience and students' English skills on forming language beliefs would provide a leap forward. Meanwhile, the findings and results of this study, which have been identified based on a broad spectrum of theories and methodologies in previous publications in English, Russian, Kyrgyz, and other languages of the researcher, can serve as a source of information for researchers, curriculum developers, and language managers.",

        "description":"In the summer of 2022, New America managed focus groups with almost 50 borrowers from across the country who reported holding federal student debt and defaulting on their loans before the COVID-19 pandemic. Focus group participants felt hopeless about their student loans, and they had good reason to feel this way. They entered the default system, which damaged their finances and eroded their economic security. Before they defaulted, many did not receive the benefits promised by higher education and were poorly served by a complex student loan repayment system, experiences that contributed to ongoing financial instability. Even though defaulting on a student loan is a worst-case scenario for borrowers, there is much we do not know about outcomes for those who default, and even less is known about borrowers' experiences in and perceptions of default. This report seeks to fill some of these knowledge gaps by providing a narrative about why borrowers defaulted, the barriers they faced while in default, and how they attempted to bring their loans back into good standing. Current and historic failures in the default system continue to damage vulnerable families' finances, and this analysis also underscores the need for additional relief for those who have been trapped in default.",

A common rationale for making this investment has been that computer-adaptive systems help educators scale up more formative approaches to teaching and learning. In this brief, Paul Zavitkovsky reviews the track record of large-scale &quot;interim&quot; tests, and wonders whether pandemic disruptions, a decade of dismal return on investment and growing demands for instructional equity might begin to turn the tide on their continuing popularity.",

The result of the correlational analysis is that learners' perceived attitudes in Mathematics such as (a) Motivation and Support, (b) Anxiety in Learning, (c) Self-Efficacy in Learning Mathematics do not significantly affect their academic performance in Mathematics as these perceived attitudes got a significant level of greater than 0.05, therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted. However, among the different ways of parental involvement stated in the study, only the mentoring strategies provided by the parents during the indicated school year have been effective in increasing their performance in Mathematics. There is a significant relationship between the mentoring strategies of parents and learners' academic performance; p= 0.016 (&lt;0.05), which means a p-value smaller than 0.05 suggests that the correlation is statistically significant (at the 5 % level). The correlation coefficient for this is -0.253, which is negative. In other words: as the Mentoring Strategies increase, Learners' Academic Performance decreases. Concerning the strength of the correlation, -0.253 can be said to be weak. Nevertheless, it is critical to investigate how parents can assist and contribute to their children's academic success. Conclusions were drawn and recommendations were offered.",

Michigan does not provide a sufficient base per-pupil amount, nor does the state properly address the cost of educating students with additional needs, especially students with disabilities, English learners, and low-income students. It would cost $4.5 billion to bring districts to funding adequacy based on estimates updated from the 2018 Michigan School Finance Research Collaborative (SFRC) adequacy study. This cost includes an estimated $1.6 billion to introduce universal, no-cost preschool. This report emphasizes the importance of the SFRC's adequacy recommendations by highlighting the following current needs and potential benefits from the SFRC adequacy study: (1) Most Michigan districts need substantial increases in revenue to reach adequate funding; and (2) Certain districts, especially those serving significant numbers of low-income students, are more severely under-resourced.",

        "description":"The prevalence of school-based healthcare has increased markedly over the past decade. We study a modern mode of school-based healthcare, telemedicine, that offers the potential to reach places and populations with historically low access to such care. School-based telemedicine clinics (SBTCs) provide students with access to healthcare during the regular school day through private videoconferencing with a healthcare provider. We exploit variation over time in SBTC openings across schools in three rural districts in North Carolina. We find that school-level SBTC access reduces the likelihood that a student is chronically absent by 2.5 percentage points (29 percent) and reduces the number of days absent by about 0.8 days (10 percent). Relatedly, access to an SBTC increases the likelihood of math and reading test-taking by between 1.8-2.0 percentage points (about 2 percent). Heterogeneity analyses suggest that these effects are driven by male students. Finally, we see suggestive evidence that SBTC access reduces violent or weapons-related disciplinary infractions among students but has little influence on other forms of misbehavior.",

But these estimates may understate teacher-related inequities if they do not account for how teacher vacancies or late hires are distributed across schools. We investigate these hiring issues using data on a direct proxy of school hiring needs: teacher job postings collected from public school district websites. These data allow us to document how, over the course of the school year, hiring needs vary across districts, schools, and subject areas. We find that schools serving more students of color have greater hiring needs throughout the hiring cycle. We also find that hiring needs for special education and STEM positions are consistently higher than hiring needs for elementary positions. Schools with growing enrollments, as well as schools and subjects with higher prior attrition rates, also tend to have more job postings. Postings for schools in towns and rural areas tend to stay open longer than for schools in suburban and urban areas. Finally, we validate that job postings, which can be obtained quickly and inexpensively, are a good indicator of school and district needs in that they closely line up with eventual teacher hires.",

        "description":"In the United States, the right to education resides in the states. Every state constitution affirmatively requires state legislatures to maintain and support a system of elementary and secondary schools open to all resident children. Although the language of these constitutional provisions varies, in all cases they mandate states, through their elected officials, to guarantee all children access to a free public education. The states, and not the federal government, are constitutionally obligated to provide education to the nation's school children. In striking down state laws that compelled racially segregated schools, the United States Supreme Court in its 1955 &quot;Brown v. Board of Education II&quot; ruling made clear that the opportunity for an education provided by the states &quot;is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.&quot; Yet consensus on a working definition of the &quot;right&quot; to &quot;equal educational opportunity&quot; and what is essential to deliver it has been elusive. Lacking a common understanding, civil and education rights advocates often fragment into separate camps: those pushing for equity in segregated schools and those calling for school desegregation as the only feasible road to equal opportunity. This brief proposes a way to move past the dichotomy of equity or diversity as the path to equal educational opportunity.",

After observing reticence and low self-esteem reported among elementary-aged students while in the process of creating works of art, the exploration, discovery, and implementation of an individualized, self-affirming strategy for recognizing and renegotiating negative internal dialogue and maladaptive behaviors occurred. The strategy, Self-Instruction (SI) refers to training focused on self-reflection and redirection of negative thinking to influence performance and self-concept (Meichenbaum, 1975). Four participants who exhibited signs of significant levels of self-doubt and the use of negative self-talk during artmaking experiences received intervention in the form of SI training. Over thirteen weeks, participants attended general art classes and weekly individual sessions. Participants were given the opportunity to practice using self-scripted language to influence problem-solving behaviors and self-concept while creating art. Data collected through observation, reflection, audio recording, documentation of artifacts, and semi-formal interviews were coded and used to analyze changes in participants' thought processes and behavior patterns over time. Attention was given to the display of confidence, independence, and perceptions of capability. It was concluded that thoughtful use of language about oneself and a supportive environment was influential in developing independence and confidence in young learners' perceptions of success in the art room.",

However, normative models for research use do not fit with longstanding empirical evidence about research use. This a) means that schools are likely to implement evidence use expectations in diverse ways that do not necessarily fit with policy expectations, b) creates challenges for developing meaningful guidance on improving research use in schools, and c) makes it difficult to assess the outcomes of, and ultimately improve, evidence use policy. This work is part of a unique, national study of schools' use of research conducted by an IES-funded knowledge utilization center, the Center for Research Use in Education. Through the purposeful selection of cases that engage in what the authors call &quot;deep use&quot; of research (see Farley-Ripple, et al, 2018), the present study links the Center's large scale, national survey data with interview data to explore how research use expectations are enacted in schools.

        "description":"Calls to improve relationships between research and practice abound, among them efforts to help researchers to work in partnership with and communicate more effectively with policy and practice audiences, informing those that govern and design educational policies and those charged with implementation in schools and classrooms, respectively. These calls range from advocacy for participatory models of research to revisions to academic incentives that presently prioritize contributions to literature above impact on policy or practice. Most recently, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report, &quot;The Future of Education Research at the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education&quot; (2022), emphasizes that the largest federal funder of education research should include knowledge mobilization among its core areas of work. The end goal of these efforts is to have a more impactful research enterprise, one that both meets the needs of and is taken up in decisions made by policymakers and practitioners. The Center for Research Use in Education (CRUE) seeks to better understand how to strengthen the relationships between research and practice to the same ends--increasing the impact of research by better meeting the needs of policy and practice and by producing work that is useful and used in decision-making. CRUE has approached this work with attention to bidirectionality--focusing on both decision-processes in the practice space and the role of research in them (Farley-Ripple et al., 2022a, 2022b), as well as research production and the strategies used to increase its impact (Van Horn et al, 2023). In this paper the authors describe the work on the latter, presenting results of a mixed methods inquiry into the knowledge mobilization practices of researchers.",

On average, we show that student ranks are highly persistent during elementary and secondary education--that is, academic mobility is limited in U.S. schools as a whole. Still, there is non-negligible variation in the degree of upward mobility across some student subgroups as well as individual school districts. On average, districts that exhibit the greatest upward academic mobility serve more socioeconomically advantaged populations and have higher value-added to student achievement.",

We find that students participating in CTE tend to have better non-test outcomes when they are assigned to a CTE teacher from the state's Business and Industry pathway--designed for CTE teachers with 3 years of industry experience but no formal teacher preparation--relative to being assigned to a traditionally prepared CTE teacher. These results can inform efforts in Washington and across the country to develop and support similar alternative routes to CTE teacher licensure.",

        "description":"When Black and Latino students are given advanced opportunities, they thrive alongside their peers. However, only a fraction of eligible students is enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) Biology, Chemistry, and Physics courses, which means that most Black and Latino students are being denied vital learning opportunities that can set them up for success in college and careers. In a report by Education Trust and Equal Opportunity Schools (EOS) found that only a fraction of eligible students is enrolled in AP Biology. Local school boards, district leaders, and school leaders have the power to implement policies and practices that can enable or inhibit access to advanced coursework for Black and Latino students, which is essential for increasing the number of people of color in STEM careers. This document has five key questions that students, families, community members, and advocates can ask their district and school leaders to make sure they are creating equitable opportunities for Black and Latino students to engage and succeed in advanced STEM coursework. [For the report, &quot;Shut Out: Why Black and Latino Students Are Under-Enrolled in AP STEM Courses,&quot; see ED622840.]",

In this study, we examine the effects of Kentucky's Math Achievement Fund -- a unique state-level program that combines targeted interventions, peer-coaching, and close collaboration among teachers to improve math achievement in grades K-3 -- on student outcomes and the costs associated with this policy. We find significant positive effects of the program not only on math achievement, but also on test scores in reading and non-test outcomes including student attendance and disciplinary incidents. The benefits exist across racial/ethnic groups and students from different socioeconomic statuses, and they are slightly higher for racial minorities. These findings, along with the cost estimate of the program, suggest that this program could provide a cost-effective blueprint to address the educational needs of students in math in early grades.",

        "description":"&quot;Making the Grade&quot; provides an annual overview of the condition of school finance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The data in this edition gives a picture of states' investment in their public school systems in the 2019-20 school year, the historic moment when public education, and society at large, experienced the massive disruption brought on by a worldwide public health crisis. Using this data, the report ranks and grades each state on three measures to answer the key question: how fair is school funding in your state? The three fairness measures are: (1) Funding Level -- cost-adjusted, per-pupil revenue from state and local sources; (2) Funding Distribution -- the extent to which additional funds are distributed to school districts with high levels of student poverty; and (3) Funding Effort -- funding allocated to support PK-12 public education as a percentage of the state's economic activity. The state rankings and grades on these measures provide crucial data a to inform advocates, policymakers, business and community leaders, teachers, parents, and students about the equity and adequacy of public school funding in their state. This report is designed to assist residents working to improve the level and distribution of funding for public school students. [For the 2021 edition of this report, see ED619401.]",

        "description":"School attendance is an important predictor of student outcomes. Regular attendance ensures students have access to learning in the classroom and allows students to build relationships with their peers and adults in schools. But too often, students face barriers in and out of school that influence whether they attend school consistently. These high levels of chronic absence have exacerbated educational and societal inequities that existed long before COVID-19. Students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, students whose families speak languages other than English, and those with disabilities are more likely to be chronically absent from school -- and may lack the resources and opportunities to make up for lost time in the classroom. This report lists five things that advocates should know about how leaders can address chronic absence: (1) Chronic absence is often hidden; (2) Chronic absence is a reflection of the school and community environment; (3) Punitive responses are not effective; (4) Improving attendance requires prevention and early intervention; and (5) Reducing chronic absence requires authentic partnerships with students, families, and communities.",

Intensive in-person college advising programs are a considerably higher-touch and more resource intensive strategy; some programs provide students with dozen of hours of individualized assistance starting in high school and continuing through college, and can cost thousands of dollars per student served. Despite the magnitude of this investment, causal evidence on these programs' impact is quite limited, particularly for programs that serve Hispanic students, the fastest growing segment of U.S. college enrollees. We contribute new evidence on the impact of intensive college advising programs through a multi-cohort RCT of College Forward, which provides individualized advising from junior year of high school through college for a majority Hispanic student population in Texas. College Forward leads to a 7.5 percentage point increase in enrollment in college, driven entirely by increased enrollment at four-year universities. Students who receive College Forward advising are nearly 12 percentage points more likely to persist to their third year of college. While more costly and harder to scale than low-touch interventions, back of the envelope calculations suggest that the benefit from increased college graduation likely induced by the program outweighs operating costs in less than two years following college completion.",

That's an impressive number, considering the many hurdles they must overcome on the road to college and a degree, including restrictions on their ability to enroll in higher education institutions; limits on access to in-state tuition, state financial aid, professional and commercial licenses, driver's licenses, state health care, and food and housing assistance; and difficulties obtaining work authorization and employment -- not to mention the threat of deportation they are under. Providing equitable higher education access for undocumented students means making college accessible and affordable for them. But it also means acknowledging the unique challenges they face because of their immigration status and ensuring that they get the additional supports they need. Researchers from The Education Trust analyzed 9 criteria in the 15 states with the largest shares of undocumented college students -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington -- to determine whether state policies are helping or hurting undocumented students' ability to attend college and how access and success for this underserved student population could be improved.

This paper measures the extent to which exposure to TFA is followed by improved student outcomes in the future. In particular, this paper measures days missed due to absences or suspensions, course grades in each core subject, and progression in math courses. We find that students taught by TFA math teachers go on to have higher grades in math courses in the following year and are less likely to miss school due to being absent or suspended. However, while students in TFA classrooms score higher on math and ELA assessments in a given year, these test score gains fade out by the following year.",

The authors examine the following six admissions models and the impact they would likely have on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity if used consistently across selective colleges: (1) Academic merit, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity; (2) High school class rank, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity; (3) Academic merit only; (4) Academic merit and socioeconomic status; (5) High school class rank only; and (6) High school class rank and socioeconomic status. All six models assume the elimination of preferences for legacy applicants, student athletes, and other groups that receive admissions boosts for reasons unrelated to academic merit, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status (SES).",

        "description":"The education system's purpose is to enable every student to have the knowledge and skills to reach their full potential -- which requires students are college and career ready. But for far too many students, the system is falling short. A recent report found 60 percent of high school graduates were not college or career ready. Closing this gap requires bold policy moves, and it requires tapping into one of the greatest incentives proven to move school performance: funding. Most states are locked into a one-size-fits-all funding approach or requires schools to adopt top-down approaches that do not always lead to better outcomes. Rather than strip funding away from underperforming schools, a properly designed performance funding model can create the needed incentive to transform outdated instructional models and reward schools for student gains. By linking a meaningful portion of funding to student learning, states can drive innovation and improvement. A key element is providing significantly larger rewards for success with economically disadvantaged and special education students, so that even districts with concentrations of these students can fully benefit. Depending on a state's specific goals and priorities, there are many different potential outcomes that can be linked with performance funding. In 2019, Texas approved one of the nation's &quot;biggest and boldest&quot; efforts to use performance funding in education. The state began providing significant bonuses for College, Career or Military Readiness (CCMR), with higher rewards for success with economically disadvantaged and special education students.

Surging enthusiasm among voters and policymakers means more states are likely to launch Education Scholarship Account (ESA) programs in the immediate future. The first part of this guide is written for a general audience, or anyone seeking a brief refresher on the decades-long rise of private school choice and the emergence of ESAs. The heart of this report draws on the wisdom of a broad group of ESA administrators. Each step includes both key questions to consider and a spotlight of a state that has implemented an ESA program. The purpose of the step-by-step guide is to support new ESA administrators as they make high-quality programs available to families and sustain those programs for the foreseeable future.",

The sample consists of 267 teachers working in the province of Batman during the 2021-2022 academic year. They were reached through convenient sampling. Two data collection tools were used in the study. To measure teachers' demoralization level, the &quot;Teacher Demoralization in Educational Policy Context Scale&quot; and the school effectiveness level &quot;Perceived School Effectiveness Scale&quot; were adopted. The demoralization scale was a self-reported one, and school effectiveness was measured based on teacher perceptions. Since the data were normally distributed, parametric tests were employed. Within the descriptive statistics, means and standard deviations were calculated, and Pearson correlation coefficients, simple and multiple regression analysis were conducted to reveal the associations between variables. The findings revealed that teachers were moderately demoralized, and they perceived their schools as moderately effective. There was a significant moderate level of negative association between teacher demoralization and perceived school effectiveness. Teacher demoralization was a significant predictor of school effectiveness. We discussed the findings based on the previous literature. The researchers made some suggestions based on the findings and for further research.",

Our analysis is based on statewide administrative microdata from the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development covering enrollees in all public postsecondary institutions statewide. We find that the potential for shifting the enrollment margin to expand degree production in STEM fields is modest, even at an upper bound, because most community college students are not academically prepared for bachelor's degree programs in STEM fields. We also find that shifting the enrollment margin is unlikely to improve racial/ethnic diversity among university STEM degree recipients. This is because community college students at the enrollment margin are less diverse than their peers who enter universities directly.",

        "author":["Gedik, Serafettin"],
        "description":"The extant literature indicates that parental engagement is positively related with student achievement (Celenk, 2003; Epstein, 1995, 2009, 2011; Gul, 2007; Henderson, Daviess, Johnson &amp; Mapp, 2007; Henderson &amp; Mapp, 2002; Kotoman, 2008; Jeynes, 2012; Sad, 2012; Sheldon &amp; Epstein, 2005; Sui-Chu &amp; Willms, 1996). Despite its promise for improving student achievement, parental engagement has been poorly understood and implemented in urban public schools. This study examines two exemplary teachers who were recognized school and district-wide for increasing parental engagement in their classrooms. The study further delves into their beliefs, experiences and practices within their specific contexts. Particularly, it focuses on exploring and capturing the existing teacher attitudes, perceptions and practices that have helped these two teachers improve parental engagement in their cases. This study utilized three qualitative data collection methods: interviews with twenty-one participants, observations of the field settings, and the analysis of the related documents. While interviews serve as the main data source, observations and document analysis were used in supporting, triangulating and complementing their findings. Data collection took place during the Spring of 2016 and concentrated on the two teachers selected for the study. The total of twenty-one participants consisted of the two teachers, fifteen parents, and four other school personnel (assistant principals and school counselors). The findings of the study document that both teachers were able to organize parents of their students around two different student-centered goals: preparing students for national exam and solving students' problems. The findings also indicate that both teachers spend a lot of extra time to communicate and collaborate with the parents of their students, and to engage parents with their children's education. The findings further suggest that the parents in in both cases were willing to collaborate with these teachers since parents believed that their engagement directly focused on and supported their children, instead of some school or teacher agenda. Also, the parents trusted both teachers, and were committed to collaborating with them thanks to these teachers' commitment to improving individual children's situations and create opportunities for the parents to do so.",

        "description":"Texans ages 25-34 who earn an associate degree are nearly twice as likely to earn at least $50,000 per year than those who don't earn a degree (24% vs. 13%). Those earning a bachelor's degree or higher are nearly four times as likely to reach this self-sustaining wage (49% vs. 13%). If every eighth grader in Harris County were to earn an associate degree, that one graduating class would collectively earn nearly $818 million in additional annual income. Across the eight largest counties in Texas, annual income gains would total $6.1 billion. Today, only 22% of Harris County students complete a postsecondary certificate or program within six years of their high school graduation This brief explains the two different definitions for &quot;College and Career Readiness&quot; in Texas and the resulting outcomes for Harris County students so that policymakers and advocates can better assess and improve students' readiness to succeed after high school.",

        "description":"Applying to college and securing financial aid are complex processes that can be barriers to college enrollment, particularly for individuals not entering directly after high school. These adults can seek out support from various organizations, including the U.S. Department of Education-funded Educational Opportunity Centers (EOCs), which operate from offices located within select colleges and community-based organizations. The EOCs primarily target their help to adults with low incomes and those who are potential first-generation college-goers. This study examines whether adding low-cost, text-based messaging can help EOCs more effectively work with their clients to increase clients' completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and college enrollment. About 3,500 EOC college-intending clients from 18 EOCs across the country were randomly divided into two groups: one received regular EOC services, and the other received EOC services plus a set of personalized, pre-programmed text messages focused on how to secure financial aid, complete key college enrollment steps, and navigate other potential barriers to college entry. The study compared the two groups to determine the effectiveness of the college transition text messaging. Key findings include: (1) Adding personalized text messaging to existing EOC services did not increase clients' rates of college enrollment or FAFSA completion; and (2) Although many clients completed important college-going tasks such as applying to college and submitting the FAFSA, 4 out of every 10 clients did not enroll in college.

        "description":"As young people progress with their education and their early careers, they find themselves pushed forward or held back at critical junctures without full regard for their individual capabilities. Their paths are too often defined less by their talents and more by characteristics such as their race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic or class status. By default, too many young people encounter barriers based on these characteristics, narrowing the scope of their educational and career options. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW) built the Pathways-to-Career policy simulation model, which uses longitudinal data to identify promising actions for increasing the likelihood of working in a good job--as defined as providing minimum annual earnings of about $38,000 per year, with a median of $57,000 at age 30. The Pathways-to-Career model establishes an actionable, solution-oriented framework for improving the economic lives of young adults by simulating the potential impacts of different pathway changes at critical junctures along the route from adolescence to early adulthood. The model relies on data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97)--an ongoing study that tracks a nationally representative sample of individuals born in the early 1980s from ages 12-16 to adulthood. The data set allows researchers to estimate the expected labor-market effects of different pathway changes for young people overall and separately by race/ethnicity, gender, and class. It also allows them to layer these pathway changes and examine the gains associated with comprehensive policy efforts to expand access to good jobs. Using the Pathways-to-Career model, they examined 38 pathway changes involving hypothetical adjustments to individuals' education, sectoral training, and work-based experiences at different life stages, from adolescence to their mid-20s. They then narrowed down these 38 pathway changes to the 10 that could most improve the likelihood of having a good job at age 30. The report outlines how the expected impacts of each of these 10 pathway changes differ by race/ethnicity, gender, and class, as well as how these 10 pathway changes could influence opportunity gaps in good jobs at age 30. It also considers the enhanced impact of strategically combining pathway changes for maximum effect. [For the executive summary, see ED628029.]",

        "description":"Addressing inequities in the educational outcomes--particularly for students of color and students from low-income backgrounds--cannot happen without comparable data from statewide summative assessments. Statewide assessment results help schools and district leaders target state and local resources to the students and schools with the greatest need and track whether these resources are impacting student achievement. Despite this, many educators, students, and families say that federal assessment and accountability policies take away from instructional time without providing actionable data. Meanwhile, pandemic pauses in administering statewide assessments and changes in political dynamics at the state and federal levels have opened a window of opportunity to develop new statewide summative assessments that gauge how students are doing, highlight disparities, and show where interventions aren't measuring up to their promise and might be improved. This paper centers the lived experiences and perspectives of students, families, educators, and district and state leaders, so that they can be used to design assessments that provide data that will enable the Ed Trust to promote equitable learning opportunities and improve outcomes for all students. To better understand how directly impacted communities are experiencing statewide assessments, Ed Trust held focus groups with diverse stakeholders who are on the ground, focusing on students of color, students from low-income backgrounds, English learners, and those who work in a school or district in which the majority of students are members of these student groups. The focus group findings informed the creation of &quot;equity pillars,&quot; which highlight key values and identify criteria for improving federal assessment policy, and federal policy recommendations for how this vision could be achieved.",

To create physically safe and emotionally supportive environments for all students, schools must adopt evidence-based approaches such as restorative justice that can be used to build and repair relationships while also holding students accountable for their actions. When positive discipline policies and practices use a race-equity lens and are fairly implemented, these efforts can not only create safe and inclusive learning environments, but also support students' holistic development.",

        "description":"The real price of college keeps rising, and it often surprises students and their families.1 People know tuition is expensive. They also usually account for books and supplies, even if they might cost more than expected. Still, they don't always expect or fully understand how the price of housing, food, and transportation factor in. It's not their fault--colleges and universities often grossly understate these costs too. Yet incomplete understanding has consequences. Not understanding the real price of college contributes to lower graduation rates and basic needs insecurity. The following report explores how colleges can better estimate and support students' non-tuition expenses. Over a year, we worked with financial aid and student affairs administrators and staff at six colleges and universities in Texas. We offered the administrators and staff training and resources related to college costs. We also tested whether a light-touch intervention at Temple University increased students' knowledge of college costs. We learned that informational barriers affect both students and college staff: (1) Students struggle to get information about the real price of college; (2) Financial aid staff tend to know about emergency aid and food pantry programs at their college, but tend to know less about other non-tuition supports; and (3) Staff who are not very knowledgeable about non-tuition supports are not comfortable referring students to these supports. We also learned that informational interventions can help students and staff overcome these barriers: (1) A short video and presentation can help students understand the cost of attendance (COA), non-tuition supports, and the financial aid appeals process; and (2) A presentation and resources on negative Expected Family Contribution (EFC) can shift administrators' understanding of key financial aid concepts and help them make better use of financial aid data. The recently announced Student Aid Index (SAI) helps colleges better understand students' needs by allowing them to see negative values, but it does not fix everything. To help students meet their financial needs, colleges should calculate and use students' negative EFC, train staff on non-tuition supports, and help students understand financial aid processes. Federal policymakers must also do their part by sharing full negative SAI values with colleges and re-evaluating current COA policies.",

Additionally, schools can turn to online learning when inclement weather hits, school buildings need repair or in response to public health emergencies. Students may rely on it when personal situations, such as extended hospitalization, preclude school attendance. While the digital divide persists for multiple reasons, the lack of broadband infrastructure and affordability are the two primary drivers. Fortunately, state policymakers have the ability to allocate new and existing state and federal dollars to address the challenges families face, meet students' needs and open new educational opportunities. The policy brief discusses: (1) raising awareness of broadband affordabilty programs; (2) prioritizing education in state and federal broadband grant programs; and (3) establishing K-12 broadband reports to identify needs and monitor progress.",

        "author":["Goldrick-Rab, Sara",
          "Cady, Clare"],
        "description":"This report is an in-depth case study of the No Excuses Poverty Initiative at Amarillo College (AC), a midsize community college in the Texas Panhandle. Nearly a decade ago, AC's leadership initiated a reflective and intentional series of steps to help alleviate the conditions of poverty affecting their students and promote the chances those students complete their degrees. The college has received widespread press and recognition for its work. This case study is the first intensive, evidence-based examination of that initiative, its key components, and its impact on student success. Students at Amarillo College are predominately Latinx and come from low-income homes. More than 70% are the first in their family to attend college. As part of both a community initiative aimed at economic growth and a campus initiative designed to boost retention and completion rates, college leadership engaged in intentional reflection, professional development, and data collection as it developed a focus on poverty alleviation. This work occurred against the backdrop of community revitalization efforts emphasizing education as a key component of future economic growth. In an effort to promote college attainment on the road to financial success, the No Excuses Poverty Initiative pinpoints poverty as the most dangerous threat to degree completion and focuses on mitigating its effects. The initiative began by educating college staff, from administrators on down, about poverty's myriad dimensions and how they can impact and disrupt students' lives. Drawing on those lessons, leaders at all levels took action, creating an oncampus social services office called the Advocacy and Resource Center (ARC), instituting an emergency fund to cover student economic crises, and establishing a network of organizations, businesses, and individuals committed to supporting students. Critically, the efforts of Amarillo College go well beyond the increasingly commonplace steps taken at community colleges around the country, such as the creation of a food pantry or stand-alone emergency grant, by supplementing those actions with case management, academic support, curriculum development, and college-wide hiring and evaluation practices. In other words, the No Excuses Poverty Initiative represents a comprehensive &quot;culture of caring&quot; that is woven into the fabric of the entire campus. While quantitative analyses have yet to turn up empirical evidence of resultant changes in student outcomes, this case study reveals several implementation lessons useful for other institutions. In particular, Amarillo College stands out for undertaking an intentional cultural shift to focus on students' basic needs, committing to ongoing staff education on the challenges facing impoverished students, and striving to fully incorporate lessons learned into institutional programs and policies.",

We find that most campus pantries have a designated space on campus, serve exclusively the on-campus community, and are run by staff, students, and faculty. Very few campus pantries have sizable budgets, but most employ some paid staff, often undergraduate or graduate students, and volunteers provide additional support. Awareness of campus pantries may be limited because common outreach strategies are informal, but barriers to support are low--just 5% of campus pantries require proof of financial need. The most common challenges faced by campus pantries are insufficient funding, food, and volunteers.",

        "description":"Consistent access to sufficient quantities and quality of food is highly important for a child's physical, mental, and emotional development, but children experiencing homelessness frequently face hunger as well as poor physical and behavioral health outcomes. Children who do not get enough food to eat may experience a variety of physical, mental, and emotional side effects that impact their ability to learn and socialize at school. To support students having access to adequate food and forming healthy habits with food, school districts and schools should implement wellness policies to increase food access for students during the school day and when school is not in session. This brief: (1) provides an overview of hunger and its trauma impacts on children and youth experiencing homelessness; (2) explains the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Child Nutrition Division (CND) policies regarding eligibility for free school meals for students experiencing homelessness, including runaway students; (3) addresses frequently asked questions about these policies; and (4) offers strategies to ensure that these students can access food both inside and outside of school.",

        "description":"The Scottish Attainment Challenge (SAC) was established to promote equity in education by ensuring every child has the same opportunity to succeed, with a focus on closing the poverty-related attainment gap. It is underpinned by the National Improvement Framework, Curriculum for Excellence and Getting it Right for Every Child. It focuses on improvement in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing. Reducing educational inequity and closing the poverty-related attainment gap is a long-term strategy which aims to impact on societal culture and thinking. On the 23 November 2021 the Cabinet Secretary announced the expanded mission statement of the refreshed SAC: To use education to improve outcomes for children and young people impacted by poverty with a focus on tackling the poverty related attainment gap. This report provides an overview of progress during 2021-22 and the impact of next steps as outlined in the 'Closing the poverty-related attainment gap: progress report 2016-2021'. Leadership is recognised as a key driver of the success of any school or early learning and childcare setting. The report also takes a closer look at Leadership-Governance and Management in relation to the SAC. Also reflected in this report is summarised findings of each local authority's next steps in raising attainment and reducing educational inequity for all of Scotland's children and young people. This report is intended to give a helpful overview of what is happening across Scotland. It is only one part of the suite of reporting and evaluation taking place across the Scottish Attainment Challenge.

        "description":"The rising price of a college education often leaves students strapped for cash and without the financial resources necessary to succeed in school and cover their basic needs, such as housing and food. These students are living on the edge, and a financial emergency can derail their dreams of obtaining college degrees. The contemporary financial aid system may not be nimble enough to respond to the nature or urgency of a student's financial emergency. Instead, some colleges and universities are providing students quick infusions of money through emergency aid programs. Such programs are springing up at schools across the country, but little information is available about their prevalence, practices, or effectiveness at helping students stay in school. In this report, researchers at the Wisconsin HOPE Lab use data from surveys and interviews conducted with emergency aid program administrators around the country in order to provide details on the current landscape of emergency aid. At least 100 programs are operating-- some have support from larger organizations such as Scholarship America's Dreamkeepers program, while others are sophisticated in-house solutions using predictive data or small local efforts of caring and committed staff. All emergency aid programs seek to help students overcome financial shocks, as sometimes a tank of gas or a grocery store gift card is the lifeline a student needs to remain enrolled. The data suggest that emergency aid programs are popular, and program administrators believe that they effectively help students, yet they face many challenges. These include: Adequately defining an &quot;emergency&quot;; Effectively stewarding resources while delivering funds in a timely manner; Ensuring that students are aware of the program while at the same time sustaining a limited pool of funding; Collecting and utilizing data to establish program effectiveness; Addressing these challenges by learning from the breadth of practitioners' experiences as well as lessons from related college retention programs (such as benefits access and case management approaches) may help colleges and universities develop well-implemented emergency aid programs. These programs might be an effective approach to supplementing the existing financial aid system. To that end, we offer five recommendations for improving practice in the field of emergency aid.

        "description":"The first five years of the Scottish Attainment Challenge saw much progress in closing the poverty-related attainment gap but at a limited pace. The pandemic disrupted the learning of our children and young people and had a disproportionate impact on children affected by poverty. The refreshed Scottish Attainment Challenge programme, backed by a further commitment of £1 billion from Scottish Government through the Attainment Scotland Fund (ASF), aims to address these challenges and ensure that equity lies at the heart of the education experience for all. This Framework for Recovery and Accelerating Progress (the Framework) has been developed to support the next phase of the Scottish Attainment Challenge. This Framework focuses on the poverty-related &quot;equity&quot; element of the Scottish Government's overall aim to achieve &quot;equity and excellence&quot; in education. Equity and excellence must be mutually reinforcing if education is to best meet the needs and aspirations of our children and young people. The Framework sets out expectations for planning, reporting, monitoring, roles, responsibilities and accountabilities. These should be applied consistently across the system to support education recovery and accelerate the pace of progress in achieving the mission of the Scottish Attainment Challenge.

Moreover, most literature suggested developing learning activities for students based on the knowledge, attitudes, and skills competency gaps. Thus, this study assessed the academic performance in terms of their examination scores among the 150 randomly selected Grade Eight Biology students in different public schools in a rural municipality in Cebu, Philippines. It employed a descriptive research methodology. The test questionnaire was anchored on the Department of Education Learning Guide in determining the student's academic performance in Biology. The respondents' data were gathered from their Biology teachers and were expressed in frequencies and percentages. Data were computed using SPSS Statistics 27. The majority of the student's academic performance in Biology for Digestive System (n=65, 43.33%), Biodiversity (n=68, 45.33%), and Ecosystem (n=56, 37.34%) competencies indicate that the majority of the respondents' scores did not meet expectations. Our findings strongly recommend that teachers carefully plan and provide necessary learning activities based on the needs and knowledge gaps of the students in their instructional practices to give their students a thorough grasp of the topics covered in the Biology class.",

        "description":"Grounded and embodied cognition (GEC) serves as a framework to investigate mathematical reasoning for proof (reasoning that is logical, operative, and general), insight (gist), and intuition (snap judgment). Geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with generalizable properties of shape and space. Mathematics experts (N = 46) and nonexperts (N = 44) were asked to judge the truth and to justify their judgments for four geometry conjectures. Videotaped interviews were transcribed and coded for occurrences of gestures and speech during the proof production process. Analyses provide empirical support for claims that geometry proof production is an embodied activity, even when controlling for math expertise, language use, and spatial ability. &quot;Dynamic depictive gestures&quot; portray generalizable properties of shape and space through enactment of transformational operations (e.g., dilation, skewing). Occurrence of dynamic depictive gestures and nondynamic depictive gestures are associated with proof performance, insight, and intuition, as hypothesized, over and above contributions of spoken language. Geometry knowledge for proof may be embodied and accessed and revealed through actions and the transformational speech utterances describing these actions. These findings have implications for instruction, assessment of embodied knowledge, and the design of educational technology to facilitate mathematical reasoning by promoting and tracking dynamic gesture production and transformational speech.

Data were collected from 251 primary school teachers and six educational experts of the city administration through questionnaires and focus group discussions respectively. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques were used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that teachers' engagement in action research in the primary schools of the city was low. It was also engulfed by many challenges. However, some opportunities which reinforce the practice were identified. Based on the findings, areas of intervention that could help to increase teachers' engagement in action research in the primary schools of the city were suggested.",

After disasters, displaced families long to return to a sense of normalcy, so reconnecting children to school is especially important during this time.

Once children are safely in school, parents have the peace of mind and freedom to focus on other post-disaster details to help their families recover. This brief: (1) reinforces the importance of ensuring that children and youth displaced by a disaster are attending school as quickly as possible after their displacement; (2) explains key aspects of the McKinney-Vento Act, particularly as it relates to students affected by disasters; and (3) provides strategies for a local educational agency (LEA) to prepare for a disaster that causes widespread homelessness, meet challenges during the disaster, and improve its response for the next occurrence.",

Students (n = 174) with learning difficulties in Grades 1-12 who received 1:1 academic tutoring through a community-based organization completed narrative writing samples in the fall and spring across two academic years. The samples were evaluated using four automated and hand-calculated WE-CBM scoring metrics. Results indicated automated and hand-calculated scores were highly correlated at all four timepoints for counts of total words written (rs = 1.00), words spelled correctly (rs = 0.99-1.00), correct word sequences (CWS; rs = 0.96-0.97), and correct minus incorrect word sequences (CIWS; rs = 0.86-0.92). For CWS and CIWS, however, automated scores systematically overestimated hand-calculated scores, with an unacceptable amount of error for CIWS for some types of decisions. These findings provide preliminary evidence that aWE-CBM can be used to efficiently score narrative writing samples, potentially improving the feasibility of implementing multi-tiered systems of support in which the written expression skills of large numbers of students are screened and monitored.

        "description":"Proper management is vital in the achievement of an organization's vision and sustainability. Several researches have shown that one management style, micromanagement, has been receiving particular attention in the corporate world due to its notoriety. Micromanagement tends to control the employees in almost all aspects; igniting employee frustration which leads to adverse effect in the company by and large. Results of micromanagement include suppressed creativity, low morale of employees and an increase in employee turnover. However, some authors argue the significance of micromanagement in specific circumstances. Thus, this study is aimed at identifying the level of effectivity of micromanagement as it relates to teachers and middle managers in the academic sector in terms of the following: compliance, productivity, competence, and job satisfaction. The study used descriptive correlational design. The researcher employed a complete census of the respondents. These are teachers and middle managers in the Basic Education Department who are from the kindergarten, elementary, junior high school and senior high school levels, with 48 teachers and 12 middle managers respectively. Findings of the study signify that micromanagement is effective in promoting compliance and productivity, moderately effective in terms of competence, and slightly ineffective when it comes to job satisfaction. Furthermore, the study also yielded no significant difference when the respondents are grouped according to profile. Similarly, there is no significant difference between the teachers and middle managers on the level of effectivity of micromanagement on this basis, it is recommended that middle managers must reconcile the use of micromanagement to uphold compliance and productivity without neglecting the teachers' competence and job satisfaction.",

        "description":"Since 2016, the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative has been developing the Total Learning Architecture (TLA), a 4-pillar data strategy for managing lifelong learning. Each pillar describes a type of learning-related data that needs to be captured, managed, and shared across an organization. Each data pillar is built on a set of international data standards that combine to increase the granularity and fidelity of learner data. Reusable Competency Definitions (IEEE 1484.20.1 RCD) are used to describe the Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other behaviors (KSAOs) that are required in the workplace (e.g., the operational environment). Learning Activity Metadata (IEEE P2881 Learning Activity Metadata) is used to describe the various learning resources an organization uses to train and educate its people. The Experience API (IEEE 9274.1 xAPI) is used to track and manage learner performance both inside and outside a learning activity. An Enterprise Learner Record, currently an IEEE study group, is used to track and manage each learner's level of competency within the organization. Together, this data enables a ledger of learner performance that ties all learning activities that a learner completes to competencies, credentials, and ultimately to the different career trajectories that a learner may pursue. The TLA data strategy includes linkages across the different standards listed above and collectively provide a data foundation for adaptive systems to build upon. This paper and discussion will walk viewers through the different data models that are being used to drive development of these standards.",

The aim of this research is to facilitate the least-learned competencies in the English subject of students of Grade 8 in Tupi National High School for the academic year 2022-2023. With this, the researcher addressed the gap that had been created on the post-pandemic year through an assessment using a supplementary program which was later tested through a competency-based test (pre-test and post-test) evaluation for its effectivity. A gamified supplementary program was created and utilized by the students in Grade 8 SPED sections. To test the effectivity of the program, the researcher made an experiment with two sets of groups: control group (traditional teaching) and experimental group (traditional with GASP). After conducting the experiment for the supplementary program, a two-sample t-test was performed to compare the scores result between the students' competency-based test. The result of the control group; pretest [mu]=25.74, which is interpreted as learned (see Appendix B), and post-test [mu]=33.32, interpreted as highly learned. While the experimental group pretest [mu]=29.74, also interpreted as learned, and post-test [mu]=50.93, which is interpreted as highly learned. Hence, the result shows that the mean of pretest in both groups showed that there is slight rise of level after the conduct of posttest in each group.",

        "description":"The dynamic and high-stakes nature of education and training requires reliance on evidence-based practices and policies to make decisions about technology adoption and implementation. In the report, &quot;Science of Learning and Readiness (SoLaR) Recommendation Report: Science of Learning Practices for Distributed Online Environments&quot; (ED612458) provided 16 recommendations for supporting distributed learning along with a learning science evaluation checklist. While that report provided all the tools needed for expert evaluation of learning organizations and courses, it did not provide a practical example of how the checklist can be used. It also did not provide evidence of the type of data that can be obtained in the form of real use cases. This current report provides this evidence by successfully evaluating two DoD training and educational organizations using the proposed Learning Science Checklist. It also provides a summary of how the checklist was implemented and the results of the use case evaluations. This work was conducted to support the greater impact of the learning sciences on readiness. This evaluation provided a concrete operationalization of the review process needed to assess the previous recommendations. The two use case evaluations covered in this report are a test of the recommendation's ability to provide successful application within existing DoD-relevant training and educational organizations. This use case report serves as an example of how the Learning Science Evaluation Checklist could be applied to provide useful and actionable recommendations for improving these recommendations.

It is described mainly by difficulties in reading, spelling, accuracy, fluency, and decoding abilities. This article is chiefly concerned to provide an overview of dyslexia, some key issues based on identification, intervention, and support for dyslexic learners, and its effects on learning mathematics. The common characteristics of dyslexic learners vary from person to person. The context of the learner, availability of the resources, and teaching strategy also impact an individual to develop dyslexia. The dyslexic learner can be identified in various ways however the four levels of the sequential model are discussed to identify the dyslexic learner. Only two intervention methods as a response to intervention and the Orton-Gillingham method are discussed. Similarly, different ways of supporting dyslexic learners and the effects of dyslexia in learning mathematics are also discussed.",

        "description":"This regional dossier aims to provide concise descriptions and basic statistics about minority language education in a specific region of Europe. Lithuanian is a Baltic language that belongs to the Indo-European family. Most of the Lithuanian-speaking minority in Poland is confined to three municipalities near the Polish-Lithuanian border. Dispersed groups of Lithuanians also inhabit a neighbouring province and urban agglomerations throughout the country. Every Regional Dossier begins with an introduction about the region in question, followed by six chapters that each deal with a specific level of the education system (e.g. primary education). Chapters 8 and 9 cover the main lines of research into education of the minority language under discussion, and the prospects for the minority language in general and in education in particular, respectively. Chapter 10 provides a summary of statistics. Lists of (legal) references and useful addresses regarding the minority language are given at the end of the dossier. [The first edition of this Regional Dossier was published in 2005.]",

        "description":"In January 2021, Eric Loepp, a faculty member in the department of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, and Will Hinz, a member of the student government, administered a survey to students in order to answer big questions surrounding higher education during the fall 2020 semester. Like other institutions, theirs was working through ideas about what a post-pandemic educational experience should look like. Indeed, this is fundamentally what motivated this project: the desire to help their institution navigate what the near-future of pandemic/post-pandemic education should look like to best serve our students, instructors, and programs. Specifically, the following key questions guided this study: (1) How did the student experience differ across modalities in terms of satisfaction, engagement, and performance?; (2) How successful were we as students and instructors adapting conventionally face-to-face activities--like group work and certain types of assessments--into purely online activities?; (3) How can we best promote learning in a largely or exclusively online environment moving forward (e.g., investing in professional development for instructors vs. non-academic support centers vs. technical training)?; (4) Can we gain systemic insight into pandemic-specific questions--like why students do or do not use webcams--for which most of our current understanding is principally anecdotal?; and (5) Ultimately, as we emerge from the pandemic, what aspects of teaching in 2020 and 2021 should we retain, reject, or revise?",

In fact, special education graduation rates in Kansas have improved more than overall graduation rates. And noted earlier in this report, test scores among special education students in Kansas declined just 1% during the pandemic, well below the test score declines among regular education students during the same time period. However, special education state aid is not keeping pace with the cost of providing the services required by federal and state law. School districts must provide these services, regardless of funding provided, forcing districts to shift funding away from general education programs. In 2022, school districts received $163 million less state special education aid than they are supposed to get under state law. This report outlines the full funding of special education in Kansas.",

Therefore, schools and school districts or local educational agencies (LEAs) and relief or service agencies in a community impacted by a disaster should work together to ensure that unaccompanied youth, including those experiencing homelessness as the result of a disaster, are identified, linked to services, and enrolled in school. This brief: (1) describes the challenges faced by youth on their own who have become homeless due to a disaster; (2) explains basic provisions of the McKinney-Vento Act relevant to serving unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness; and (3) provides strategies for local educational agencies (LEAs) and relief agencies to put into place to serve unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness before and after a disaster occurs.",

Even though thematic progression has been studied a lot, it is still interesting to see how much scholars have looked into it, especially in the context of the second and foreign language. The previous studies had consistently confirmed the following results: (1) thematic progression contributes to the coherence and cohesion quality of student essays; (2) problematic thematic progression in student essays includes the emergence of the brand-new theme, overuse of constant pattern, empty rheme or undeveloped rheme, double rheme, intervening material between rheme, incomplete of the clause, subsequent thematization, confusing selection of textual theme, empty themes, themes with undefined reference and thematization of rheme and lack of thematic progression &amp; loosely thematic flow. For further research, other researcher can make a review article who emphasis on thematic progression in the aspect of various fields, genres of text or non-academic texts produced by students to look the cohesive and coherent aspects of the student's writing.",

        "description":"Education is a lifelong endeavour that starts in the womb and lasts until death. It helps the individual to develop full potential by allowing to control the environment of his/her own successful life and living. The foundation of education begins in one's very early childhood and lays the foundation for later stages of educational progression. Nowadays, a growing number of children in early childhood spend a great deal of time in playing electronic games rather than traditional games. Parents and educators are concerned about the current trend because they strongly believe that traditional child games develop more skills than modern electronic or video games. A traditional game can be beneficial in all aspects of early childhood development, including physical or motor, social-emotional, moral, cognitive, and linguistic development. The present study aims at illustrating the importance of traditional Kashmiri games in ensuring the balanced development of children's personalities. The data used were taken from the books, personal sources, journal articles, newspapers, websites, government records, etc. which is mainly qualitative in nature. The results showed that traditional games can have a positive effect on children's motor, linguistic, cognitive, social, and emotional development.",

        "description":"COVID-19, which affects the world, undoubtedly seems to have affected university students who receive applied education. Sports Science students continue their sports training within the mask and distance rules by switching to face-to-face teaching during the normalization period. This study aimed to reveal whether the physical activity levels of Sports Science students were affected by Coronavirus-19 phobia after switching to face-to-face training. 432 (female; 152, male; 280) university students from Sports Sciences attended the research. Data from the participants were collected using the Coronavirus-19 Phobia Scale and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). The independent sample and Mann-Whitney U test, One-Way, and two-way ANOVA test (Post hoc Tukey) were used in the data analysis. According to the results, the 'psychological' sub-dimension scores of the participants, an increase in body mass index, not doing sports, reducing the vaccine dose, spending COVID-19 in the hospital, and wearing a mask in practical classes increase. In addition, those who wear masks in applied lessons have higher 'somatic,' 'social,' and 'economic' sub-dimension scores. Females' coronavirus-19 phobia, 'psychological' and 'economic' sub-dimensions, and total scale scores are higher than males. Consequently, with the increased physical activity levels of Sports Science students, coronavirus-19 decreases phobia scores.",

        "description":"The present work has revealed an inside story of university physics education in Bangladesh. The four large autonomous universities in the country were chosen to get the real reflection of physics education to perform this investigation. Sophomores, juniors, seniors, and master's students were the participants randomly selected from these four universities at the same time of education years 2013-2014. The number of participants from each year of each university was twenty physics students, and the sample size was 320. The same questionnaire about academic resources and activities in the physics departments was used in the survey. The investigation has revealed that the theoretical results of the secondary and higher secondary students were very good but obtained without complete understanding. About 64% of students study physics against their intention as they were interested in engineering or medical courses, though the interests were not their own in every case. Many of the physics students were not attentive enough to the academic activities in the department. Many students were interested in physics research without proper awareness and induction about research. In addition, teachers were not fully engaged in the department to make the students capable of understanding and learning physics independently. As a result, only 14% of the students were consistent in their opinions and had good confidence about the promising future for physics education and research in Bangladesh. However, devoted quality teachers, students with a substantial interest in physics, and the necessary resources are required to improve physics education.",

        "description":"This study aims to conduct a literature review to explore the justification for including programming and coding in K-12 curricula. Additionally, it considers the value of teaching computational thinking and programming principles, pedagogical strategies, and the advantages and drawbacks of teaching programming to young students. Most studies acknowledge that programming courses effectively motivate and engage students and achieve learning objectives. However, research reveals that teachers lack the skills to teach programming, and even seasoned educators may find it challenging to develop and implement the necessary pedagogical strategies. Researchers recommend using frameworks based on sociocultural theories of learning, increased resources and training, student-centered instruction, and lowering teacher workload, which has led various nations to re-evaluate their curricula. Finally, the review concludes by suggesting the need for more research on how teaching and learning programming affects learning in other academic disciplines.",

More prevalent in K-12 special education, MTSS practices are emerging in early childhood. In previous reports, we described the Making Online Decisions (MOD) web application to guide DDDM for educators serving families with infants and toddlers in Early Head Start home-visiting programs. Findings from randomized control trials indicated that children at risk for language delay achieved significantly larger growth on the Early Communication Indicator formative language measure if their home visitors used the MOD to guide DDDM, compared to children whose home visitors were self-guided in their DDDM. Here, we describe findings from a randomized control trial indicating that these superior MOD effects extend to children's language growth on standardized, norm-referenced language outcomes administered by assessors who were blind to condition and that parents' use of language promotion strategies at home mediated these effects. Implications and limitations are discussed. [This article was published in &quot;Exceptional Children&quot; (EJ1273994).]",

In 2004, we reported initial development of an observational measure of infants' and toddlers' social skills designed for early educators, the Early Social Indicator (ESI). Here, we report preliminary findings on the ESI's feasibility, sustainability, and sensitivity to growth in social engagement based on a large, multiyear sample of children in one early childhood program that agreed to pilot the measure. Results indicated that ESI use by program staff was sustained over a 5-year period. Program staff were reliable coding a range of children's positive and negative nonverbal and verbal social skills. However, staff were not reliable when coding the target of a child's social response when it was not the Adult play partner (i.e., the Peer, or Nondirected target). Results documented sensitivity to growth over time, dynamic patterns of change within and across key skills consistent with the typical course of social development, and moderation by children's home language and Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) status.

        "description":"This study aimed to investigate the effect of field trips in the Primary stage on developing empathy and English language fluency. The researcher reviewed the literature for EFL fluency related to field trips and then designed a component list as a baseline for a pre-posttest, and a rubric for measuring the students' performance through field trips and the empathy quotient of the students. The participants were 6th -grade students in al Hoda international school, aged 11-12 years old, and the researcher adopted the quasi-experimental study design. Data were collected and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings showed a higher level of empathy and English language fluency. Post-treatment results illustrated authentic real-life experiences that affected both empathy and the EFL fluency of the students. The three variables were harmoniously connected to develop the learners academically and emotionally. Field trips broadened the students' minds, and empowered their abilities in critical thinking, analysis, collaboration, and problem-solving. Field trips also increased the flow of their language, and strengthened their relationships with each other and their teachers. Moreover, field trips increased the learners' self-awareness and social awareness through their contact with others.",

        "description":"Turkish coffee is accepted as a Turkish cultural heritage. It was placed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2013 by the United Nations. Drinking coffee is one of the oldest traditions and customs in most countries in the world. Every country in the world has its own coffee culture and tradition. In Turkey, drinking coffee and welcoming guests with coffee have been a very well-known tradition for a very long time. Even in small villages and small towns in Turkey, Turkish people love drinking coffee and preparing coffee for their guests and neighbours in their houses or in their gardens. Employers also enjoy drinking coffee with their staff or with their customers. This tradition and custom have been going on in our country and in our hometowns for ages. Drinking coffee makes people more sociable and talkative while spending time with their relatives, friends, neighbours, or colleagues. There are also health benefits of drinking coffee and Turkish coffee. This study deals with teaching coffee culture and the coffee museums in the world. Students can learn many different kinds of adjectives, adverbs, nouns, idioms, and proverbs that are related to these museums in the world. Some of these words, idioms, and proverbs will be given. Sample classroom activities will be shared. [Paper presented at the International Conference on Language, Education and Culture (2nd, Istanbul, Turkey, Jun 27, 2019).]",

        "description":"The National Quality Framework (NQF) was introduced to improve the quality of Australia's early childhood education and care and outside school hours care services. One goal of the NQF was to reduce unnecessary compliance burden on children's education and care services through a jointly-governed system of regulation, replacing overlapping regulatory activities by Australian, state and territory governments. The Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) leads and monitors the nationally consistent application of the Education and Care Services National Law, including the NQF, and promotes quality and continuous improvement. ACECQA is required to report regularly on the progress of the implementation of the NQF to the Australian Government and state and territory governments through the Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood (SCSEEC). This includes reporting on 'the experience of services under the NQF, with respect to the level of regulatory burden.' This is ACECQA's first report on longitudinal research on children's education and care services' perceptions and experiences of administrative burden under the NQF. The report is presented in two parts. Part I contains findings from ACECQA's research on the administrative burden perceived and experienced by education and care services. It was finalised in July 2013. Part II reviews these findings and details actions already in progress and recommendations on what further steps might be taken, without compromising the quality objective, to reduce or eliminate burden associated with those administrative activities identified in the Part I report. The Part II report also identifies where additional support can be provided to the sector for activities that are fundamental to the focus on quality under the NQF, such as quality improvement plans and educational programing.",

The Wave II perception survey was conducted in February and March 2014.

Findings reveal that: (1) Respondents from centre-based services reported lower overall burden in Wave II (2014) than in Wave I (2013); (2) Respondents perceived lower burden with supervisor certificates and displaying information in Wave II. This effect was particularly influenced by respondents from preschools and kindergartens; and (3) A greater proportion of approved providers of not-for-profit services agreed that 'administrative requirements of the National Law and Regulations are simpler than the previous licensing and accreditation systems' in Wave II.

The study reveals a number of positive findings including consistently high levels of support for the National Quality Framework (NQF) and a significant decline in perceptions of overall burden associated with the administrative requirements of the National Law and Regulations -- down from 15 per cent who reported very high levels of burden in Wave I to nine per cent in Wave III. This decrease is associated with three specific administrative requirements -- supervisor certificates, provider and service approvals, and ensuring staff know about the National Law and Regulations. It is notable that each of these requirements has been the focus of targeted efforts by governments and the Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) to support services and minimise administrative burden. There have also been significant improvements between Waves I and III and between Waves II and III in responses to the following statements: (1) that administrative burden has reduced since the introduction of the National Law and Regulations; and (2) that the administrative requirements of the National Law and Regulations are simpler than the previous. licensing and accreditation systems.

A description of the backgrounds, commitments, experiences, and preferences of students at HSIs and differences found between responses from Hispanic/Latinx and non-Hispanic students are discussed. Primary topic areas are demographics, first-generation student standing, cultural orientation, primary language and fluency in Spanish, family and work commitments, relationship status, family support, living arrangements, means of financing college, course load, STEM identity, annual income of household of origin and of personal household, locus of control orientation, familism, and experience in college. The result is a thorough and up-to-date profile of the HSI student population in TX and NM. Statistical analysis revealed multiple significant differences between Hispanic/Latinx and non-Hispanic students attending the HSIs and the presence of several significant predictors for forms of activity and patterns of commitment. The findings are immediately applicable to process, program, student support, and instructional planning, implementation, and evaluation for over 120 HSIs in the region and, by extension, to hundreds more across the United States.

        "description":"Test-only placement systems are associated with inaccurate placement determinations that can perpetuate college achievement gaps by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). In response to the pitfalls of traditional, test-only placement systems, colleges across the country are increasingly experimenting with and adopting alternative placement strategies that reduce the number of students assigned to prerequisite developmental education and increase access to college-level courses. These reforms benefit underserved students but by themselves are not enough to eradicate long-standing disparities by race/ethnicity and SES in outcomes such as introductory college-level (or gateway) course completion and credential attainment. For placement reform to be both effective and equitable, it is best coupled with additional related reforms, including improvements to curriculum, instruction, and student supports. Aimed at practitioners, this brief provides guidance to institutions seeking to design and implement placement systems that redress limitations of test-only systems and that work in conjunction with other reforms to generate more equitable outcomes. It draws on research literature as well as examples from the field to highlight promising strategies for addressing barriers to equitable access to and success in college-level courses, including barriers that may persist after broad placement reform has been implemented.",

To really lay the groundwork for higher education and profession readiness, the education in pre-school years receive must be reliable with and coupled to early elementary schooling with more focus on developmental needs, and efforts to prepare the future citizen for potential success as vigorous, fruitful, affianced citizen. Recent research suggest that the better way to tackle disparity, poverty and misdemeanour is early childhood education which includes sensitization of parents and community as a whole. Pre-school education helps to develop a firm base for lifelong learning and can play an important role in the development of child. Making sure all children start on an equal footing can also alleviate social discrimination. It is thus vital to endorse continued financial support to maintain the expansion and excellence of pre-school education programmes.

        "description":"The path to an excellent, high-quality education can be complex for students who have been historically and systemically excluded, including students of color, students experiencing poverty, students with learning differences, and multi-language learners. In 2020, Digital Promise launched the Equitable School Systems Transformation (ESST) Initiative, engaging eight K-12 school districts nationwide to address specific equity challenges within their districts through a multiyear process of system transformation. ESST gives participating districts several supports, including a clear framework for education systems change; exposure to diverse models of systems transformation from the U.S. and countries around the world; deep, customized coaching in the context of each district's Problem of Practice (PoP); and a collaborative design process to ideate, prototype, and develop solutions. Year 1 of the ESST Initiative shows that following these principles will take time, but participating districts acknowledge that the investment was worth it because they were able to begin developing deeper and more sustainable solutions to entrenched problems than they had in the past. Throughout the past year, Bellwether partnered with Digital Promise to document the districts' journey through the ESST Initiative process and capture lessons. This report provides a detailed description of the first year of implementation of ESST (2021-2022), including an overview of the processes driving Inclusive Innovation and resources from the work that may be useful to other educators. The authors conclude with key takeaways that can inform the work of other school systems seeking to use an Inclusive Innovation approach to drive equitable systems transformation around the country.",

Individual Growth and Development Indicators (IGDIs) for infants/toddlers are measures that programs can use for universal screening, progress monitoring, intervention decision-making, and accountability. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, IGDIs were administered and scored exclusively in person by certified early educators. Because of COVID-19, EI/ECSE practitioners could no longer conduct in-person assessments. We report how two early intervention programs implemented IGDIs using remote protocols that included (a) preparation of parents for IGDI administration at home, (b) session observation by program staff using videoconferencing, and (c) remote coding of the child's performance by program staff when interacting with a parent/caregiver play partner using the standard toy set. The remote protocols are described, and uptake by the programs is compared before and during the pandemic. Equivalence of children's scores from in-person versus remote protocols is reported, as well as caregivers' and program staff's preferences. Implications for remote early childhood services are discussed.

Planning and implementing initiatives for a return to school cannot just focus on a return to &quot;normal&quot; because of significant increases in other threats to children's well-being during the pandemic and beyond, including increased anxiety and isolation, dramatic spikes in youth suicide, and steep decreases in academic achievement. This resource will examine some of the critical components of a successful return to school in the 2021-22 school year.

        "description":"It is estimated that, on average, students will have suffered a 30 to 40 percent learning loss due to the disruption in face-to-face learning caused by COVID-19. This assessment is alarming for any student but is even more troubling when one considers the persistent performance trends for students of color, students with disabilities, and students who are English learners. A 40 percent learning loss for the most vulnerable students coupled with meager achievement in a normal school year will turn the achievement gap into a chasm. The National School Boards Association (NSBA) recognizes that based on factors including but not limited to disability, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, students are deprived of equitable educational opportunities. Operating with an equity lens empowers school board members to intentionally allocate resources, instruction, and opportunities according to need, requiring that discriminatory practices, prejudices, and beliefs be identified and eradicated. School board members have the positioning and power to employ the key levers to create more equitable outcomes: (1) Ensuring equity in school funding; (2) Ensuring access to high-quality and high-level curriculum; (3) Ensuring access to effective teachers; (4) Ensuring safe and supportive school climates; and (5) Fostering meaningful community engagement. This guide will explore how school board members can set the tone and create policy to influence operations in each of these areas so that all students receive the resources they need to graduate prepared for success after high school.

        "description":"For the last five years, the California Department of Education (CDE) has reported a steady increase in homeless K-12 students in the state. In the academic year 2018-2019, over 207,000 California K-12 students were without appropriate, consistent and stable housing. Unhoused K-12 students are disproportionately LGBTQ+, migrants, students of color, and students with disabilities, exacerbating existing inequities. Homelessness among young people has also been shown to negatively impact both immediate educational performance and long-term outcomes. The existing homelessness system of care fails to respond effectively to the scale and scope of this problem. Stigma, lack of funding, unclear eligibility criteria, and disjointed coordination impede youth access to housing opportunities and associated services. As a result, there is an immediate need for additional resources and programmatic restructuring at both the state and federal levels to offer unhoused K-12 youth the support they need to thrive. This policy brief analyzes the efficacy of policies and practices responding to unhoused students in the state of California and makes recommendations for policy and programmatic improvement.",

        "description":"Last year, school leaders were faced with unprecedented challenges as they grappled with school closures, the shift to online and hybrid models of instruction, and supporting their communities with an increased awareness of the need for social justice reform. The COVID-19 pandemic and killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and others shined the light on inequities that have existed in our public education system for far too long. In response to these challenges, NSBA issued its guide entitled, &quot;Reimagining School Board Leadership: Actions for Equity.&quot; This resource was a collaboration between NSBA's Dismantling Institutional Racism in Education (DIRE) initiative and Center for Safe Schools and focused on acknowledging and understanding current events and the historical issues of systemic racism in America. This resource established a call for school boards to rise to the current challenges our school systems are facing to transform public education, with a focus on equitable access to world-class education for every student. This &quot;Questions for Boards to Ask Supplemental Guide&quot; provides additional resources on how school boards can engage in conversations to drive this work forward.

        "description":"The overarching goal of schools is to create a safe, supportive environment where students can thrive and learn. This begins with a dedication to students' social and emotional well-being, and effective policies and programs that create a culture of trust. Such a culture provides an optimal learning environment, and is also a proactive step towards avoiding conflict, violence, and legal liability. But to do school safety right is a herculean task that touches virtually every aspect of school policy and operations, and extends well beyond into the community at large, including every level of government, public safety agencies, community services programs, private agencies, places of faith, social research arms, families, and students themselves. No one resource can address every issue or question about keeping children safe. This updated guide provides a renewed look, through a legal lens, at key areas of concern that have emerged as looming issues that need attention as schools work to improve school safety. These include student mental health, crisis management, working with law enforcement, and legal liability. There are many issues that are not addressed here that will affect the decisions that school board members have to make to keep students safe. For example, this guide does not discuss building security, a key component of a school safety plan. The guide is intended as a primer for school boards and school leaders to begin their exploration into this important subject. The guide is designed to give school board members, as policy-makers for the district, an overview of: (1) schools' legal obligations and liability concerns; (2) best practices; and (3) available resources.

School systems can be proactive and plan to respond in a flexible way to a public health threat. Schools and school districts can refine their business operation response plans. School administration, including health services leadership, must be involved in the planning process, which includes partnering with local public health authorities, updating infectious disease pandemic plans, and sharing essential communication strategies.

        "description":"Most studies of the relationship between intelligence and divergent thinking and between personality and divergent thinking put in examination singly. Apparently, an integration of intelligence and personality would lead to finding a common source of their shared effects on divergent thinking. 425 undergraduate students at universities of Perm city (Russia) took part in this study. There were 298 women and 127 men aged 17 to 22 years. Three levels of the individuality traits were specified: the nervous system, the temperament, and the personality traits. The nervous system variables were measured by the Pavlovian Temperament Survey, the temperament by the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour -- Temperament Inventory, the personality traits by the Big Five Inventory-2. Path models from individuality traits to fluid and crystallized intelligence to divergent thinking were tested in which the individuality traits were exogenous variables, the fluid and crystallized intelligences mediators, and the divergent thinking composite index the endogenous variable. Direct effects of the individuality traits on the divergent thinking were as follows. Nervous system and temperament traits produced no significant effects on the divergent thinking. Of the personality traits, Open-Mindedness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion scores provided significant effects on the divergent thinking. When the individuality traits of different levels were combined, the Open-Mindedness and Agreeableness scores only revealed significant effects on the divergent thinking. The crystallized intelligence, in contrast to the fluid intelligence, mediated the specific indirect effects of some individuality traits on the divergent thinking. The total indirect effect of the individual traits through the fluid and crystallized intelligences as mediators on the divergent thinking was higher than that of the crystallized intelligence alone. When the individual traits of several levels were involved together in the model, the multileveled structure of the individuality traits was adjusted.

De-identified data were contributed by 180 college and university counseling centers, describing 190,907 unique college students seeking mental health treatment; 4,688 clinicians; and 1,287,775 appointments. In this report, CCMH explores how counseling centers contribute to the academic mission of institutions by examining the risk and protective factors associated with voluntary withdrawal from school during services. This investigation was critical given the concerning national rates of &quot;drop out&quot; among college students. CCMH examined if any information routinely collected when students enter counseling services was associated with leaving school during services. While several variables increased the risk, students who identified as freshman/first-year status with current elevated levels of academic distress and a history of a psychiatric hospitalization were 48% more likely to withdraw from school during treatment. Several protective factors were discovered that reduce the risk of withdrawal from school, including improvement in Depression, Generalized/Social Anxiety, and overall distress symptoms during services. Most notably, when Academic Distress significantly decreased during counseling and students were concurrently participating in an extracurricular activity, they were 51% less likely to withdraw from school. The current findings highlight the critical role college counseling centers serve in supporting the academic mission of institutions. When students improve during services at counseling centers, they are more likely to persist in school. [For the 2021 report, see ED617358.]",

Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) commissioned Macquarie University to lead a national study of long day care (LDC) services that had improved their National Quality Standard (NQS) rating over two sequential NQS assessments. This report presents findings from the three phase, mixed-methods Quality Improvement Research Project, which investigated the characteristics and internal processes of quality improvement in LDC services. While recognising the integrated nature of the NQS, and interrelationship between the seven quality areas, the study concentrated on Quality Area 1 (Educational Program and Practice) and Quality Area 7 (Governance and Leadership). Genuine and sustained quality improvement is the result of collaborative effort, and therefore needs to be seen as a shared responsibility. The findings place emphasis on the need for leadership at all levels of service delivery and early childhood education and care (ECEC) policy. In particular, the important role of the Educational Leader is highlighted. The study also identifies priority areas to support and sustain quality improvement evidenced by improved Assessment and Rating (A&amp;R) outcomes.",

We use administrative records of a German public university, covering all programs and courses between 2006 and 2018. We find that gender match effects on student performance are sizable in smaller classes, but do not exist in larger classes. This difference suggests that direct and frequent interactions between students and professors are important for the emergence of gender match effects. Instead, the mere fact that one's professor is female is not sufficient to increase performance of female students.",

Too many state education finance systems today are inequitable, outdated, and inadequate, and there are often significant political barriers to change. Advocates for educational equity can and should play an essential role in shaping the allocation and structure of state funding for pre-K through grade 12 public schools. For this report, the authors interviewed advocacy leaders in six states -- California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, and Nevada -- to learn more about the conditions that enabled and influenced big changes in their education finance systems. Leaders reflected on their policy wins and losses and offered advice to other advocates interested in pushing for funding reform. These conversations revealed five common conditions that emerged in different ways across states and paved the way for state policy changes. In order of frequency, they were: (1) Coalitions; (2) Champions; (3) Research; (4) Economics; and (5) Lawsuits. This playbook is about the contexts and conditions that facilitated those changes.",

Rates of depression and anxiety among youth skyrocketed, resulting in an increase in emergency room visits related to youth mental health. While children and youth were reporting the need for behavioral health supports prior to the pandemic, the isolation, stress, and increased material hardships of the pandemic strained the vulnerable mental health of California's young people. This document highlights recent, state-funded, one-time investments in counties, districts, schools, and health plans that are eligible to receive dollars to implement various student mental health projects. Children Now's review of these programs revealed some fundamental shortcomings in statewide implementation that must be addressed for these dollars to be fully leveraged to close gaps in access to support for children and youth most in need.",

Without continuation of agriculture and manufacturing receipts, our people and communities will be unable to afford to critical services throughout our region (Aiman-Smith &amp; Green, 2002, Deryn, 1989, Ditcher, 2001, Gianesi, 1998, Liker, 1997, Lozano, 2009, Minarro-Viseras Baines, &amp; Sweeney, 2005, Ohio Economy, 2016). Collaboration and articulation agreements between Wright State University-Lake Campus (WSU-LC), the State of Ohio and our bordering Indiana counties have ensured local agricultural students will have the opportunity to increase skill sets as necessitated by regulations and agricultural innovations. Manufacturing has an equal, if not greater, need for increased manufacturing skill sets. As a regional college campus in the University System of Ohio, we propose to create a Bachelor Degree in Applied Manufacturing Science (BAMS). The curriculum developed will provide a solid core of foundational coursework complemented by applied technical courses industrial manufacturing disciplines. The technical courses will focus on the practical application of manufacturing knowledge and include the basics of applied mathematics, manufacturing safety, and understanding manufacturing symbols and blueprints. Advanced skills will include mastering basic electrical through automation systems, hydraulics and pneumatics, additive and subtractive manufacturing processes, including CNC mill and lathes, machining, welding and 3D printing. Other coursework will include management theory.

In this report, the authors share key findings from their research on digital credentials and LERs and present three detailed case studies of initiatives to govern and implement digital and microcredentials with the goal of achieving the fourth United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 4): equitable access to quality education and lifelong learning. This requires creating opportunities for marginalized populations and closing gaps in achievement and employment outcomes, while recognizing that learners are starting from different points and have different needs. Based on the interviews, case studies, literature review, and feedback from public engagements, the authors present a conceptual framework for guiding the further development of digital credentials and LERs. This framework builds on three key principles from the Global Convention on Higher Education--equity, sovereignty, and mobility--which were refined further to add the principle of trust. For each principle, the authors provide recommendations to guide the development of more ethical and fair education technology ecosystems that do more good than harm. The goal is to make the complex and evolving ecosystem more accessible to nontechnical audiences.",

Taking this concept of the dual role of the teacher in the classroom, the ideas of regarding the didactic-pedagogical triangle and aspects of Charlot's theory of the relationship to knowledge, we constructed a 3x3 matrix (table) called the Teacher Matrix as an instrument for analyzing teachers' perceptions, reflections, and actions in the classroom. The instrument was applied into the interviews of two teachers in activities in a teacher education program. The instrument was very interesting for identifying teachers' characteristic movements, as well as their perceptions, reflections, and actions from their speeches.

        "description":"The Cloud's presence in both personal and professional lives has happened so quickly. In fact, many of the educational tools employed by teachers and district offices operate through an Internet connection only. The advantages of Cloud-based platforms and learning tools are obvious--ease, convenience, 24/7 accessibility, less staff time maintaining on-site servers, individualized learning, and compliance with testing requirements. But along with these benefits come serious challenges, particularly the potential for loss of privacy that accompanies the transfer of personal student information to the Cloud. Concerns about data privacy are real and must be addressed by public school districts, which reflect the values and norms of their communities. This guide is a resource for a K-12 public school board member. It is designed to help identify the crucial issues associated with student privacy when school districts use online educational services, and recommends a comprehensive approach to addressing student data privacy protection.

This brief builds on literature on distance learning in general and on distance learning with English Learners in particular. School and district leaders operate in a multilayered, nested, ecological system in which all aspects and layers of the system interact and affect each other. Because school and district leaders' actions influence all of the other layers of the system, the brief first presents important aspects of this nested system, outlining district responsibilities and school roles that relate to what school and district leaders can do to better serve English Learners. The brief then explores how to support the development of teacher expertise in designing and implementing distance learning for English Learners.",

        "description":"This brief focuses on Colombia which, like most countries globally, closed its schools in March of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As throughout most of Latin America, Colombian schools remained closed for over a year, and they only began to gradually reopen in July 2021. The brief explores the pandemic's impact on student learning by analyzing trends in student achievement in national assessments from 2015 to 2019 and comparing them with student achievement in the same national assessments carried out in 2020 and 2021. It also explores the extent to which students in subnational territories (ETCs)--the equivalent to U.S. states, except some are certified by the national government to have more autonomy in spending than others--with different lengths of school closure periods experienced varying levels of learning losses. Findings indicated that the effects of COVID-19 on student learning in Colombia were greatest for female students and students from wealthier backgrounds, a surprising finding given that studies from other countries have found that students from socioeconomically disadvantaged households suffered larger learning losses than their peers from wealthier households. A plausible explanation is that in Colombia students from wealthier backgrounds tend to attend better schools. Findings also showed that learning losses due to COVID-19 were lower in ETCs that provided access to in-person schooling sooner.",

A school district's data security measures might include keeping student and staff personal data in locked filing cabinets, and limiting access to those filing cabinets to people within the school district who need that data in order to do their jobs. Data security also includes using encryption when transmitting personal data electronically, requiring school district employees to use passwords to access files containing personal data, and installing software that detects intruders in the computer network.

The study collected information through an online survey among mostly European VET providers, national authorities, employee and employer organisations, in-depth country case studies and interviews, as well as Cedefop's ReferNet network. While the topic has gained in importance in the context of higher education, focusing on vocational education and training does justice to the complexity of microcredentials in education, training and learning for the European labour market. Results show that microcredentials have only recently become prominent in Europe-wide policy-level debates, despite the existence for many decades of short courses and credentials that support labour-market-related education and training. Although there is uncertainty linked to the naming and function of microcredentials, clear benefits with regards to their flexibility and responsiveness to labour market needs can be observed. The current report focuses on and explores the take-up, characteristics and functions of microcredentials in European labour-market-related education, training and learning. The mapping exercise helps to identify the main characteristics of microcredentials as currently emerging in the context of VET and reskilling and upskilling initiatives.",

Although these arrangements vary across countries, it is possible to identify common trends over time, such as institutional hybridisation, the blurring of boundaries between IVET and general education. Despite this development, IVET has been able to retain a distinct identity, which is attractive to learners and has the support of key labour market actors. This reflects IVET's adaptability and resilience in the face of change. Building on a Europe-wide survey of VET providers and in-depth national case studies, the study delivers a timely update of, and insight into, the continually changing IVET landscape. Results show increasing similarities in how countries configure their IVET systems. This is evident in the broadening of IVET curricula, the prominence given to the work-based learning pathway, as well as the growing importance attached to local and regional autonomy.

In order to discuss this article systematically, four research questions are addressed. First, what are the concepts and principles of happiness in terms of religion and philosophy? Second, what are significant factors of happiness? Third, what are physical happiness and spiritual happiness? Last, is happiness indeed the ultimate goal in higher education? The research questions are defended through a descriptive analysis, with a cross cultural approach. As for the limitations of the study, happiness is focused on the lenses of the Eastern and the Western philosophical and religious aspects related to conventional higher education, especially South Korea and Canada. The Eastern aspect is limited to Buddhism and Confucianism, whereas the Western aspect is focused on ancient Greek philosophy and Christianity. Specifically, the study is mainly focused on not merely Buddhist Sutras and Confucius' and Mencius' classics, but Plato's and Aristotle's philosophical works and Christian &quot;Scriptures&quot; (&quot;The Bible&quot;). This article focuses on the notions and principles of happiness in terms of religion and philosophy. Lastly, higher education is focused on the lenses of South Korea and Canada.

        "description":"A very small number of young people enter youth custody between age 16 and 18 (about 4 in 1000 males), yet the consequences are severe. They spend an average of 7 months in youth custody and such incarceration has been related to negative outcomes in the longer term even if they can establish themselves in the labour market. In this paper, we evaluate whether there is a relationship between GCSE qualifications in English and maths and the probability of youth custody using administrative data in England. We are hindered in this because the majority of young people who end up in youth custody are not entered or fail their GCSEs in these subjects. Although regression results are consistent with educational achievement being a factor in why people end up in youth custody, they strongly suggest that both non-entry/low achievement and youth custody are correlated with severe vulnerabilities which are partially picked up by the explanatory variables available in administrative data (in particular indicators for special needs, disadvantage and being from some ethnic minority groups). Another interesting insight is that for many, problems only emerge (or at least become evident) in early or middle adolescence. [This paper forms part of a larger project funded by the Nuffield Foundation &quot;Youth custody: Educational influences and labour market consequences.&quot;]",

        "description":"Education is crucial for the cultivation of successful individuals, healthy communities, robust societies, strong economies, and a healing planet. Yet, while most available education measures show impressive improvement in access in low- and middle-income countries over recent decades, there remains a heartbreaking gap in educational outcomes between and within countries. While there are many attempts to address low learning outcomes around the world, many efforts abide by a short-term project mindset, limited funding, and a focus on proof-of-concept pilots. However, small-scale efforts cannot solve the challenges within education systems today. Addressing contemporary educational challenges requires coordinated action among stakeholders, ongoing evidence of impact, and an emphasis on expanding and deepening the impact of any single intervention so it reaches more learners and changes whole systems. In a word, it requires &quot;scaling.&quot; The term &quot;scaling&quot; represents a range of approaches--from deliberate replication to organic diffusion to integration into national systems--that expand and deepen impact, leading to lasting improvements in people's lives. This report examines the scaling journeys of 14 regional and global education initiatives that are attempting to scale within 30 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The report presents empirical reflections and offers relevant guidance. [This project is supported by the Global Partnership for Education Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (KIX), a joint partnership between the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC).]",

Using content analysis, a systematic evaluation of texts to examine nuances to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative data. This was such of importance, however, difficult to study due to issues of interest like in the study, frequency of lexical items in ESP, and GE textbooks. Results found 13,713 lexical items in Hospitality Management, 17,561 in Criminology, 4576 in Tourism, 7167 in Marine Engineering, and 512 in Information Technology. Furthermore, the overall percentage of ESP lexical items fell in Tier 2 (with multiple-meaning while the least was in Tier 3, specifically on context-specific vocabulary. It is the core of vocabulary learning to ensure English language teaching. It is its goal to help learners better understand language, allowing them to understand others as they want to express themselves as well. This applies not only in speaking but also in writing and reading. Wilkins (1972, p. 111-112) stated that without grammar very little understanding can be acquired and without vocabulary there can be no learning at all. Thus, even without good grammar, so long as you equipped with useful words and expression, one can still manage to communicate. Lewis (1993) argued that &quot;lexis is the heart of language&quot; and that it develops a better fluency and expression in English. He also added the significance to the learners of acquiring a more productive vocabulary knowledge, also, their eagerness to develop their own personal vocabulary strategies. Thus, a proposed bridge model program was recommended to highlight the study findings using the lexicons found from the different respective courses.",

The first is the causal commonality, the second is the generalizing commonality, third is the intertwining commonality. Confirmatory one- and two- factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis (PA) specified the operationalization of the commonality. 235 undergraduates at universities in Perm city (Russia) involved in this study. Participants were 178 women and 57 men, age 17 to 22 years (M = 18.61, SD = 0.88). The set of variables entered individuality traits (nervous system, temperament, and personality), fluid and crystallized intelligence, and creativity. The main results were as follows: (1) The variables of individuality provide individual-intellectual integrations and function as the causal commonality; (2) Variables of individuality and creativity provide individual-intellectual integrations and function as two forms of causal commonality; (3) The generalizing commonality did not arise by means of one- or two- factor CFA; (4) The intertwining commonality of the variables of individuality and the variables of intelligence and creativity has not found empirical support by means of PA. The recommendation proposes that although constructs of individuality and intelligence with creativity differ, researchers may apply to the commonality criterion.

All interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a content analysis method. The research findings indicate that there were several differences between the effective and ineffective children in their awareness of other child's MSRL. Effective children considered monitoring processes related to their understanding of the task goal and nature of a task and using cognitive state as important elements of the model's successful work, whereas ineffective children described separate elements unrelated to a task goal.

For the classes of 2018, 2019, and 2020, an average of just over 160 individuals per year earned an astronomy PhD at one of the 45 departments in the US with an astronomy doctoral program. From these three classes, around two-thirds of PhD graduates accepted a postdoc. Most of the other graduates secured potentially permanent employment. The graduates accepting potentially permanent jobs entered very different employment positions than those accepting postdocs. Most of the postdocs were in academia, while most of the potentially permanent positions were in the private sector. Those taking positions in the private sector typically reported considerably higher starting salaries than those accepting postdocs. Despite the lower pay, more of the graduates accepting a postdoc find their work challenging, and a higher proportion indicate being satisfied with their employment.",

New attention before and financial aid during the pandemic perhaps slowed the spiral, but it hasn't reversed it. The primary cause of the shortage in Greater Minnesota is simple: family child care providers, who supply the bulk of child care in rural regions, are leaving the field at a much faster rate than people entering it.

        "description":"Efforts to invest in students' networks--either to bolster support or expand professional opportunities--should start with a deep understanding of and appreciation for the networks of which they are already members. Recognizing and respecting students' inherent resources and cultural wealth is what this report refers to as an asset-based approach. Luckily, a host of innovative organizations focused on more equitably building and maintaining students' social capital are doing just that. This report describes the profound potential of these organizations' approaches to mapping and mobilizing students' existing social networks, and details emerging strategies and tools that schools should consider. To surface these examples, the authors interviewed and convened program leaders from a variety of schools, nonprofits, and social enterprises. These leaders have all endeavored to help students map out, reflect on, and mobilize their existing networks in some form or fashion. Because deficit-based approaches may be more common among institutions serving low-income students, first-generation students, and students of color, the majority of the programs interviewed explicitly focus on serving students from these backgrounds, with strategies attuned to their students' racial and cultural identities. This paper explores the research behind relationship mapping and the basic tenets of building a relationship map. To illustrate how and when schools can use relationship mapping to serve a variety of short- and long-term goals, it highlights examples of current programs. Finally, it offers recommendations for furthering the vision and unlocking the potential of relationship mapping.",

        "description":"Many of California's public school teachers cannot afford to live in the communities where they work, forcing them to commute long distances or pushing them out of the education system altogether. Attracting new teachers has also grown more challenging. Housing prices have climbed across the state, yet the majority of the nearly one thousand local educational agencies (LEAs) in California offer entry-level teacher salaries below the Area Median Income. As housing affordability challenges intertwine with staffing challenges, more and more LEAs are considering building workforce housing on land they own. The Teacher Housing Act of 2016 authorizes California LEAs to pursue affordable housing for employees and shifts the playing field on development finance. LEAs can now address employee housing by leveraging a range of programs and fiscal resources available to other housing developers. This report provides an extensive review of the need for public education workforce housing solutions, where and how such strategies can--and are--being implemented, and recommendations to advance housing solutions on LEA-owned land.

        "description":"Today, free public kindergarten for five-year-old children is available in every state and community throughout the United States, and public education is routinely referred to as K-12. But kindergarten did not start out this way. Kindergartens in the United States once served children as young as three and four years old. In fact, today's movement for public pre-kindergarten (pre-K) is a consequence of the gradual exclusion of almost all three- and four-year-olds from public kindergarten. A century ago, the U.S. kindergarten landscape looked similar to preschool today. Kindergarten had limited public funding and was predominantly composed of private programs paid for by families and charitable donations. It took more than a hundred years to establish kindergarten as a public good. This report explores the history of Kindergarten in the United States and seeks to answer the following questions: How did kindergarten become a public good?; Why were children under age five excluded from public kindergartens?; How did that impact the evolution of services for younger children?; and How can the kindergarten story inform the establishment of free early care and education for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers today?",

        "description":"The exclusion of caregivers and other stakeholders from conversations about child care policy design exacerbates inequities in the sector. By design, women, people of color, parents, people without wealth or high incomes, and child care providers are severely underrepresented in positions of power, including the government positions that influence child care policy investments. Bringing these diverse voices into the policymaking conversation increases the ability of these constituency groups to ensure that policy decisions result in equitable outcomes that value the needs of children and families and the work of child care providers. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, child care programs shut down or reduced their capacity, and parents pulled their children from programs due to health concerns and struggled to manage work without child care. As the backbone of a sector already suffering from a chronic lack of public investment, child care providers were asked to do even more, including paying for protective equipment and additional cleaning supplies, often with fewer resources as a result of a system that typically pays based on attendance rather than enrollment. For early educators who already struggled with chronically low pay and lack of benefits, the added strain caused by the pandemic created new challenges that drove many away from the sector. This report looks at five key lessons learned from how Michigan, North Carolina, and Mississippi engaged child care stakeholders in the distribution of their emergency child care funding granted as part of the COVID-relief packages passed by Congress in 2020 and 2021.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic has re-emphasized the need to develop innovative solutions to unprecedented problems in health, education, and other sectors. The learning crisis in education is reaching catastrophic levels, the consequences of which are disproportionately felt in populations that are already marginalized. School closures, together with fiscal shortages, preexisting structural deficiencies, and lack of equitable access to alternative forms of learning have contributed to this dire situation, which is mirrored in indicators of learning levels. As the world is emerging from the uncertain times of the pandemic, the education community has a unique opportunity to explore innovative and alternative ways to avert the continuation of the global learning crisis. Considering fiscal constraints and reduced funding for education, it is imperative to harness lessons from initiatives that work. A culture where the incentives and interests of each actor involved in the process are aligned is crucial to effectively using limited resources and maximizing the welfare of the targeted populations. Impact bonds, which are the focus of this report, present one such alternative. An impact bond is a form of results-based financing in which one or more investors, often impact investors, provide risk capital to deliver social services, and are paid their principal plus some return for actual outcomes achieved. In theory, this arrangement tackles the moral hazard problem common in development finance and ensures that everybody is working to achieve agreed-upon results.

CSCCE developed the solutions detailed in the &quot;Early Educator Engagement and Empowerment (E4) Toolkit&quot; based on the experiences early educators have shared and the research CSCCE has conducted.

CSSP's research efforts were designed to reach families with low and moderate incomes and families of color--especially Black and Latinx families who experience chronically high rates of poverty and economic insecurity due to historical and present-day racism. CSSP's interview and survey data show a snapshot of how families were impacted by the temporary American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, with a specific focus on Black families with incomes between $25,000 and $35,000 per year. This commentary looks at that data combined with research and analysis from additional sources to understand how families benefited from ARPA child care relief funds, with a particular look at Michigan and North Carolina.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented uncertainty both within teacher preparation programs and in schools. While it has exacerbated existing and long-standing inequities in California's educational system, the pandemic also presents an opportunity to innovate teacher education programs and rethink how they prepare and sustain candidates of color, particularly Black teachers. Qualified, engaged teachers are critical for all students, but especially for students who face systemic barriers. Racism, poverty, immigration threats, and community violence hinder students' ability to achieve their full potential. Today, California is facing an acute teacher shortage, fueled in part by the pandemic, an overall workforce shortage, a dearth of applicants, as well as the unevenness of current teacher preparation programs. The result is inequities in instructional quality that disproportionately affect Black students. Well-prepared teachers who reflect the diversity of the students they serve are needed to ensure that all students, especially low-income students of color, have access to rigorous and engaging learning opportunities across the curriculum. To address the success of Black students, California must invest in programs to attract, support, and retain Black teachers.

The QSP is an initiative of, and funded by, the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education Early Childhood Education Quality Assurance and Regulatory Services Directorate (NSW DoE), involving the delivery by Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) of free tailored professional development and support to approved providers and service leaders of eligible services across NSW. The QSP has been implemented in four stages, with each stage comprising separate groups of services in 'rounds' of up to 18 weeks of tailored support. These rounds have overlapped with each other. This report covers Stages One to Four. The objectives of the QSP are to improve the quality of participating services so they receive a rating of Meeting NQS or higher, and to improve participants' knowledge of and confidence in the NQS and assessment and rating. Participants were provided with bespoke resources, a QSP facilitator to answer questions, discuss improvement priorities and through a coaching approach prompt critical reflection, and provide one-on-one targeted tailored support with continuous quality improvement. The structure of each QSP round consisted of introductory workshops, provision of eLearning modules and other resources, service visits, support phone calls, video coaching calls, and emails. Workshops and service visits were conducted in-person in Stages One and Two and mostly online in Stage Three and Four due to COVID-19 restrictions. Different service types presented with different contexts and support needs. The QSP drew on the insights of participants to produce service-type specific resources. [For the report from Stage Three, see &quot;Supporting Quality Improvement in Education and Care: Quality Support Program Stage Three -- Key Findings&quot; (ED622370).]",

        "description":"As states look at ways to support schools and districts, many turn to policies surrounding preparation and licensure in an effort to better equip leaders entering the field to be successful. States have developed policies, grounded in school leadership standards, to strengthen and increase the number of quality school leaders through traditional and alternative routes to preparation and certification. This 50-State Comparison shows how all states approach school leader certification and preparation policies. The interactive report contains the hyperlinks to tables answering the following questions: (1) Has the state adopted leadership standards? (2) Which state entity approves traditional school leader preparation programs? (3) Does state policy require school leader preparation programs to align with adopted standards? (4) Does state policy require field experience as part of school leader preparation programs? (5) Does state policy allow for innovative or experimental preparation programs? (6) What are the initial school leader certification requirements? (7) What are the requirements for school leaders licensed out-of-state? and (8) Is there an alternative route to initial certification? Key takeaways are included.",

        "description":"This study explored the educational journey of a Mexican immigrant teacher from a resiliency perspective by taking a particularized look at how the participant overcame the challenges she faced during recertification processes in the United States. Researchers adopted narrative inquiry methods, collected qualitative data including interviews, field notes, and artifacts, and analyzed the data using content analysis. The immigrant teacher encountered a series of challenges such as language barriers, discrimination, and unfamiliarity with recertification processes. Despite the presence of difficult circumstances, the participant optimized various resources and educational opportunities. The study found that the participant resilience was oriented not only in personal factors but also in external resources. The study also uncovered that ongoing, purposeful, and systematic institutional supports had an impact on the participant resilience. The findings indicate that the success and resiliency of highly motivated Mexican immigrant teachers may not be absorbed solely by the personal level of motivation. Rather, they may continue integrating all personal, external, linguistic, cultural resources and systematic institutional supports to surmount obstacles through ongoing and active interactional processes towards their professional goals.

Variables focused on are success rates of students attending a Hispanic Serving Institution, gender, major, technology, and attending a higher education institution during a pandemic. Conflict theory was used to understand how upper-class students would have more resources needed to successfully complete courses in a Hispanic Serving Institution during a pandemic. The impact the pandemic had in the response rate was drastically seen. Due to the limited response rate, nonparametric tests were used. However, insignificant results were seen. This study shows how the researcher needs to become more resourceful in collected data using an instrument or resort to qualitative methods.

To guarantee successful reading instruction, teachers across the nation are being trained in the science of reading, which focuses on explicit instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. Large reading initiatives are tirelessly working on plans to implement the science of reading training to in-service teachers; however, what are universities doing to support their efforts? Dr. Kelli Smith, Dr. Tami Shelley, and Mrs. Pam Higgins teach reading instruction to early childhood and elementary students at Auburn University at Montgomery (AUM). Our experiences as elementary students, teachers, and leadership roles drive our desire to prepare pre-service teachers with the tools and skills needed to be confident reading educators.

        "description":"The &quot;2023 Pro-Kid Policy Agenda for California&quot; is the comprehensive state-level roadmap to ensure that all children have the necessary services and supports to reach their full potential. California has an obligation to end systemic injustices that create barriers to kids of color, as well as kids living in poverty, undocumented kids, and kids in the foster care system, from growing up healthy and ready for college, career, and civic life. This work has only become more urgent as the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to have a disproportionate impact on the lives of California's kids, especially children of color. Kids are increasingly experiencing stress, social isolation, and disconnectedness, and youth mental health issues have reached crisis proportions. In addition, the learning loss and lack of preventive health care because of the pandemic threatens this entire generation of children. Policymakers are urged to use the &quot;Pro-Kid Agenda&quot; as a guide to take long overdue action now to ensure California's systems for children are equitable, well-funded, high-quality, and accountable to kids' success. Doing right by all kids is not only the right thing to do, but it is also essential to state's future and ability to thrive. California's continued economic growth and strong democracy is dependent on a healthy and educated workforce. State policymakers need to make smart, strategic, and quality investments in California's children to address poverty and close the widening income divide. Working together, policymakers can build a California where all kids have the chance to live out their dreams. The &quot;Pro-Kid Agenda&quot; can help get there. The &quot;Agenda&quot; was developed by Children Now, California's whole-child research, policy development, communications, network building, and advocacy organization that covers the full range of children's issues prenatal to age 26, including early learning and development, TK-12 and higher education, health, family and economic supports, and child welfare. Children Now plays a lead role in more than 90 coalitions across the state and coordinates The Children's Movement of California, a network of more than 5,000 diverse organizations statewide, ranging from direct service, business, labor, youth, and parent organizations to civil rights- and community-based groups.

        "description":"The application of item response theory (IRT) is almost universal in the development, implementation, and maintenance of large-scale assessments. Therefore, establishing the fit of IRT models to data is essential as the viability of calibration and equating implementations depend on it. In a typical test administration situation, measurement disturbances that influence model data fit are expected. Unfortunately, test administrations nationwide experienced new measurement disturbances because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the substantial disruption in education, did the response patterns of test takers change enough that model data fit is threatened and the degree of confidence in applying IRT analyses diminished? Using data from a large-scale state assessment system's 2019 and 2021 administration of the same test forms, model and data fit statistics for items and test takers were evaluated. The summary item fit index Q[subscript 1] (Yen, 1993) and the person fit statistic l[subscript z] (Choi, 2010; Drasgow et. al., 1985) were used for the analyses. Results from the study provide evidence that there wasn't a greater risk to the use of IRT models in 2021 than in previous years, despite the measurement disturbances introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This study sought to answer questions about the perceived factors affecting their development as teachers of young children and the potential for improving the recruitment and retention of male teachers in the primary grades. Male and male of color elementary school teachers were invited to share their perceptions of their experiences related to becoming and being a teacher in the primary grades through a questionnaire and interviews. The study found participants felt that their experience as teachers was informed by uniquely gendered factors, such as their male and/or intersectional identities and the associated perspectives and experiences as well as by more global factors such as their commitment to their professional expertise as effective teachers. Overall, the study suggests that both gendered and global factors have implications for recruitment and retention given that they contribute to male and male of color teachers' sense of competence and satisfaction teaching young children in elementary settings.

        "description":"Dual enrollment--in which students take college credit-bearing courses when still in high school--is becoming increasingly popular. Community college programs account for about 70% of the dual enrollment that more than one million high school students participate in each year nationwide. Yet dual enrollment can be a big financial burden for community colleges. In most parts of the country, community colleges receive less funding per dual enrollment student than they receive for their regular, non-dual-enrollment students. If community colleges are to continue to provide broad access to high-quality programs, they need to be able to sustain these programs. In this paper, we consider the economics of dual enrollment from the perspective of the community college. We illustrate how dual enrollment may not be financially sustainable in colleges and states where it is offered at a discount, but we also show how community colleges can structure their programs to be more efficient. To support our analysis, we describe case studies to show the conditions under which dual enrollment is affordable and efficient.",

Project-Based Learning (PBL) pedagogy was adopted to redesign a course to scaffold and support the students in the achievement of the course learning outcomes. This pedagogy was selected as its emphasis is on ill-defined problems, problem-solving, collaboration, authentic real-life applications, and the creation of an end product (Savery, 2006). In the revised curriculum, students were challenged to learn instructional design methods and simultaneously produce a robust eLearning deliverable that evidenced the very instructional design principles being learned. The technology project was based on a needs assessment survey designed to capture self-reported gaps in the knowledge, skills, and abilities of individuals in the instructional design field. This exploratory case study reports on the design process related to how the course adopted a Project-Based Learning framework, the varied scaffolding strategies employed to reinforce the achievement of learning outcomes, and the instructional design decisions that facilitated and supported the learners in the achievement of technology-based projects in under seven weeks.

        "description":"Shared governance--the processes through which faculty, the administration, and even students and staff participate in creating the policies and charting a direction for an institution--is a major tenet of higher education. How to get cooperation and agreement to move an institution forward is one of the trickiest parts of the leader's job. Yet moving forward must be a priority as higher education copes with the emergence of technology-enabled learning solutions while maintaining an increasingly expensive traditional educational model. Add to this environment a number of stressors--from the challenges of educating during the pandemic, to shrinking numbers of high school graduates, to turbulent debates over what schools can and cannot teach and what faculty can and cannot say--and it is imperative to chart strategic paths forward rather than stay put or drift. There is arguably never been a more difficult time to be a leader of a higher education institution. The average tenure of a college president has consistently and steadily declined over the last couple of decades. It is no longer unusual to see presidential tenures end after three to five years. This report presents a theory from the Christensen Institute's research on innovation that can help leaders. It is a theory about what tools to use when there are varying levels of agreement within an organization. Used as a lens to better understand causal mechanisms, the theory reveals that not all the tools available to leaders work in all circumstances. To successfully chart a course forward, leaders need to understand the level of agreement inside their college or university and then use the right tools to forge ahead.

        "description":"The Center for Universal Education (CUE) at Brookings has been investigating efforts to scale and sustain evidence-based initiatives leading to large-scale improvements in children's learning. CUE has been implementing a series of collaborative action research initiatives called Real-time Scaling Labs (RTSL), in partnership with local institutions in several countries. The goal of these RTSLs is to generate evidence and provide practical recommendations around the process of scaling in global education--encouraging a stronger link between research and practice. This report focuses on one of the scaling labs in Jordan, launched in 2019 in collaboration with the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ), the MoE, and INJAZ. The lab focused on this partnership-led process of implementing, adapting, and scaling the National Financial Education Program (FEP) in grades 7-12 across the country. While this report is focused on the story of the FEP, it also serves as a case study into larger questions of how an evidence-based initiative can achieve progress toward national sustainable scale, with lessons that are transferable beyond FEP and Jordan. Section one of the report provides a brief background on the case, including an overview of the education ecosystem, movement to promote greater financial inclusion in Jordan, and brief descriptions of key actors and initiatives engaged with FEP. Section two details the story of implementing, adapting, and expanding FEP in Jordan to date--exploring critical factors, opportunities, and challenges related to its design, delivery, financing, and enabling environment.

        "description":"Educational elitism is an issue to be tackled, the necessity of which has already been widely established but reinforced amid COVID-19 pandemic given that learning has been greatly disrupted; elitism in Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is a matter of debate, the settling of which still awaits more empirical studies in different educational contexts. Conducted in a particular Chinese higher education provider, this mixed-methods study examined the effects of CLIL in an online English teaching programme and indicated that when teaching practices were appropriately designed and enacted in response to learners' differing needs, students of different academic capabilities could make remarkable achievement in both language learning and content learning. This makes a contribution, though small, toward dispelling the myth of elitism in CLIL and establishes some evidence on the promotion of inclusive education in the time of COVID-19 crisis. However, a critical view should be held to elitism in either online education or CLIL with a much wider research agenda in various educational contexts to be explored.

Responsible for systems of learning that also include school nutrition, bussing, safety, finances, community engagement, and so much more, superintendents recognize that they need a different strategy to effectively address the learning needs of the whole child. Only with a collective approach--one where nonprofit organizations, community members, families, government agencies, institutions of higher education, afterschool programs, museums, faith-based groups, and others can rally around the school and its children--can they successfully create the conditions where children can learn and thrive. Increasingly, district leaders are finding community schools to be the strategy they need and are taking advantage of federal grants and supportive policies in states such as New York, Maryland, Vermont, New Mexico, and California to start and sustain community school initiatives. Given the crucial role played by superintendents, this brief lays out 10 tips for district leaders to effectively start and sustain community schools.",

According to this report from the Center on Reinventing Public Education and RAND, half of school system leaders say that these disagreements are disrupting schooling. Almost one in three district leaders also said their educators had received verbal or written threats about politically controversial topics since fall 2021. The findings come from surveys issued to 300 district and charter network leaders and interviews with superintendents. Their responses shed light on how political polarization has affected classrooms and how districts are responding. This report presents results from the fall 2022 survey of the American School District Panel (ASDP). The ASDP is a research partnership between RAND and CRPE. The panel also collaborates with several other education organizations, including the Council of the Great City Schools and Kitamba, to help improve outcomes for students throughout the United States.",

The purpose of this proposed study is to measure the level of innovative and entrepreneurial (I&amp;E) attitudes in elementary students and assess how nurturing activities over time affect those same students' I&amp;E mindsets. Students will be in the fifth and eighth grades in the public-school systems in Jefferson County, Indiana. The study will use quantitative descriptive and explanation research design and will utilize a control group. This study will investigate the correlation of elementary I&amp;E mindset growth and age appropriate I&amp;E leaning activities in order to actively promote and nurture future entrepreneurial intentionality. Presenters will discuss hypotheses related to how nurturing activities over time affect those students' attitudes towards innovation and entrepreneurial thought.

        "description":"The essence of Genetics lies in the understanding of the concepts of Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. Although these ideas are fundamental to the field, they are notoriously difficult to understand and visualize. While simulation-based instructional materials are found to improve the teaching-learning process in science education, little has been done to assess their effectiveness in teaching and learning the concepts of Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. Hence, this study aimed to examine the effectiveness of simulation-based instructional materials towards the learning performance of Grade 12 learners on the concepts of Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. This study utilized a mixed-method approach. Results of the pretest and posttest showed that the learners demonstrated from approaching proficiency to advanced mastery level on the concepts of Central Dogma of Molecular Biology. Furthermore, it was revealed that the pretest and posttest mean scores of the learners on the concepts differed significantly (p&lt;0.05). The result of the semi-structured interview revealed that the learners were engaged in experiential learning with the use of simulation-based instructional materials. An action plan was designed based on the study to utilize the simulation-based instructional materials in the teaching-learning process. [For the complete proceedings, see ED626149.]",

        "description":"Nokomis Regional High School, which draws nearly 600 students from eight different towns in rural Maine, has spent 10 years transforming its instructional model to immerse students in meaningful learning experiences that relate to their interests and passions. Project-based learning, interdisciplinary courses, and career exploration units are designed to help students explore various options and feel secure about their postsecondary choices. As students near graduation in this rural community, some plan to enroll in college, while others envision entering the trades or starting a job. Staff at Nokomis want students to achieve success on their own terms, which means challenging the predominantly college-oriented attitude that persists in high school practice and policy. But many teachers and administrators are still grappling with how to ensure that students choosing different pathways--some involving college, some not (or not yet)--will have an equal shot at long-term success and stability relative to their peers. Some staff think the school should more assertively push students toward college and career options beyond the local rural community. This case wrestles with how high schools can expand students' postsecondary horizons while remaining responsive to their values and interests--especially if those values differ significantly from those of the adults who support them.

The district cites Opportunity Academy (OA), an alternative education program within the district's high school, as a key driver of these improvements. OA surrounds students with supportive relationships and provides multiple pathways to graduation, including a competency-based pathway in which students earn credits through flexible learning experiences inside and outside traditional classrooms. But for OA's design team, getting students to graduate isn't enough. Real success, the principal said, means students have &quot;the ability to live a choice-filled postsecondary life.&quot; This case wrestles with what's needed to achieve this higher bar for students who often just want to get high school over with, but whose success beyond the K-12 system depends on life skills, supportive relationships, and concrete postsecondary plans in addition to a diploma. The case concludes with key questions for high school leaders and design teams in both traditional and alternative education.

        "description":"The Federal Pell Grant program, authorized by Title IV-A-1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, (HEA; P.L. 89-329), as amended, is the single largest source of federal grant aid supporting undergraduate students. The program provided approximately $26 billion in aid to approximately 6.1 million undergraduate students in FY2021. Pell Grants are need-based aid that is intended to be the foundation for all federal need-based student aid awarded to undergraduates. In award year (AY) 2017-2018, 44% of undergraduates received Federal Pell Grants. 2 Unlike loans, students are not required to repay Pell Grants. This report provides descriptions of key elements of the Pell Grant program and information on recipient demographics, award levels, award value, program costs, and program funding prior to the effective date of the FSA, as amended. (For information on key changes authorized by the FSA that go into effect for award year 2024-2025, see CRS Report R46909, &quot;The FAFSA Simplification Act&quot; (ED617513)). The first section of this report addresses how the program works and describes the basic process for awarding Pell Grants, including the application process, student eligibility requirements, award rules and calculations, and the role of the institution of higher education (IHE) in the process. The subsequent sections provide information on recipient characteristics and the role the program plays in relation to other student aid. The report explains the complex Pell Grant funding streams and their implications. Finally, program costs and estimates are presented. In addition, the appendices provide historical Pell Grant award amounts (Appendix A), Pell Grant recipient counts (Appendix B), recent and future program funding (Appendix C), surplus and shortfall levels (Appendix D), and acronyms commonly used in the report (Appendix E).",

The second of these laws provided a higher amount of funding than the first, and the third provided a higher amount than the second. The funds were intended to help the U.S. educational system &quot;prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.&quot; Funds were generally made available to states, local educational agencies (LEAs), private schools, and institutions of higher education (IHEs) to support the transition to remote learning, provide support services to students, protect education-related jobs, provide institutional support, and provide grant aid to postsecondary students. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136) was signed into law. Included in the act was the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), which was created &quot;to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally.&quot; The ESF was composed of three emergency relief funds: (1) A Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund; (2) An Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund; and (3) A Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). This report discusses the ESF and the programs initially authorized under it that were included in the CARES Act, Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSAA), and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA; P.L. 117-2). The report begins with an overview of the appropriations available for the ESF and the required reservations of funds under each act. It then discusses each of the emergency education relief funds, including the EANS program. The next part of the report provides an overview of the other provisions included in the ESF: maintenance of effort (MOE) and maintenance of equity (MOEq) provisions, reporting requirements, continued payments to employees, and definitions. The report also includes several appendices that provide information on state funding under the GEER Fund, EANS program, and ESSER Fund, and funding aggregated at the state level and institutional sector level under the HEERF based on ED's published grant amounts, as well as information about periods of obligation and liquidation of funds and deadlines that apply to HEERF.",

With educational, medical and health and human services dispersed across the state in local communities but administered at the state level, there is a continuous call for efficient and economical processes for educating practitioners and families about the unique right s and responsibilities associated with the federally mandated Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). The &quot;IFSPweb&quot; is a web-based tutorial designed to educate parents and professionals about the IFSP process and document in Nebraska and promote best practice in early intervention services in the state. This report describes an evaluation of the &quot;IFSPweb&quot; describes the current use of the website by providers, effect of its use and providers judgement on its utility in advancing their roles with families.",

In academic year (AY) 2020-2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021), 6,063 domestic institutions had written agreements with the Department of Education (ED) that allow them to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. To receive Title IV assistance, students must attend an institution that participates in the Title IV programs. This report provides a general overview of HEA Title IV institutional eligibility requirements, as well as some institutional Title IV student aid program participation requirements. It first describes general eligibility criteria at both the institutional and programmatic level and then, in more detail, the program integrity triad. Next, it discusses several issues that are closely related to institutional eligibility: Program Participation Agreements, including the 90/10 rule and campus safety policies and crime reporting required under the Clery Act, and distance education.",

        "description":"Since 1997, education tax benefits have become an increasingly important component of federal higher education policy. For 2023, 11 higher education-related tax benefits are available. After 2025, absent legislative action, this number will effectively increase to 13. Two provisions that are temporarily suspended are scheduled to be reinstated--the personal exemption for dependents (including college-age dependents) and miscellaneous itemized deductions (including for unreimbursed work-related education expenses)--while the exclusion for discharged or forgiven student loan debt will only be available in limited circumstances. The available tax benefits are a mixture of credits, deductions, exclusions, and other incentives. The benefits can be placed into one of three general categories: (1) incentives for current year expenses; (2) preferential tax treatment of student loans; and (3) incentives for saving for college. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates currently available higher-education tax benefits will cost an average of $25 billion per year over the FY2020-FY2024 budgetary window. This report provides a brief overview of the higher education tax benefits that are currently available to students and their families. The report contrasts higher education tax benefits with traditional student aid; presents a brief history of higher education tax policy over the past 60 years, including recent legislative proposals to modify these tax incentives; summarizes key features of the available tax benefits; and provides JCT estimates of revenue losses resulting from individual tax provisions. The summary is contained in Table 1 and provides information on various aspects of each tax benefit including the type of benefit (credit, deduction, etc.), the annual dollar amount of the benefit, what expenses qualify for the benefit, what level of education the benefit can be claimed for, income levels at which the benefit phases out, and, if the provision is temporary, when it expires. Table 2 contains estimates of the annual forgone federal revenue attributable to each provision.",

        "description":"Probability is generally considered one of the most challenging areas to teach in mathematics education due to its intricate nature. However, the simulation-based teaching method can increase students' accessibility significantly to the probability problems because it enables students to resolve the problems with minimal mathematical skills. By substantially reducing the stress caused by complex mathematical calculations, simulations help students focus on the key concepts of complex probability problems. Furthermore, the programming languages, such as R and Python, can be easily implemented in classrooms to perform simulations that allow students and teachers to discuss the idea to solve the probability problems step by step. This article presents a classical probability problem known as 'the broken stick problem' to show the efficiency of the simulations in teaching probability. It contrasts the effectiveness of mathematical and computational simulation approaches to the solutions of the broken stick problems with several variations. For concrete illustrations, a series of R codes and their examples are provided at the end of the article, which can be used for the simulation study in probability class with various versions of broken stick problems. The extension of the computational approach to other historic probability problems is also discussed. [For the complete proceedings, see ED626149.]",

        "description":"Years of cognitive research has shown background knowledge in key subject areas, like science and social studies, is essential to reading comprehension, helping students not only understand the meaning of a text, but also interpret new words and ideas. Failing to provide the opportunity to learn to read has devastating effects on children and alarmingly, the current reality fails some students disproportionately--the number of students reading proficiently drops precipitously for Black students, Hispanic students, English language learners, and students with disabilities. Critical to righting this inequity are well-prepared teachers who can deliver engaging opportunities for students to learn core content foundational for reading comprehension. However, for teachers to provide students with background knowledge to support them in becoming successful readers, they must first gain the knowledge themselves. Teacher preparation programs, therefore, play a critical role in providing aspiring teachers with the content knowledge they need to teach their future students. Are preparation programs achieving this goal? To find out, the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) engaged experts from the field, teacher preparation program faculty, and measurement experts to design the Building Content Knowledge standard, one of the seven standards of the Teacher Prep Review, to ascertain the extent to which undergraduate elementary teacher preparation programs (and the institutions in which they are housed) build candidates' content knowledge in two core subject areas: science and social studies.

This report is required to include the dates on which students withdrew from enrollment, the grade level at which the students were enrolled at the beginning of the school year, the grade levels at which the students were enrolled when the students transferred, and information on whether the students enrolled in another public or private school or home-based education (home school) setting or graduated or completed high school within the same year. Based on an analysis of the 2019-20 data for students enrolled in both types of online schools, the three most widely assigned exit codes were for: (1) students withdrawing and transferring to a school in another school district (n=1,079); (2) students dropping out (n=1,004); and (3) students transferring to a nonpublic home-based education setting (home school) (n=580). The data from 2018-19 compared to data from the 2019-20 year showed a decrease of 273 student withdrawals. Students coded as completing and not exiting at any time during the school year increased by 848 students from the previous year. [For the 2020 report, see ED610711.]",

This paper discusses the impact hands-on experiential learning laboratories have on both technical understanding and soft skill development utilizing different teaching modalities: completely asynchronous online delivery or a hybrid delivery incorporating synchronous virtual lectures and in-person hands-on building activities. Hands-on experiential learning laboratories have been used in conjunction with other instructional delivery methods, helping students connect the dots between theory and application. These hands-on laboratories provide opportunities for students to &quot;learn by doing&quot; by building full-scale assemblies, developing both technical and soft skills. A survey was conducted to determine students' perspectives on how hands-on experiential exercises impacted both technical and soft skill development, and responses were analyzed for the different teaching modalities employed. Overall, all technical skills and most soft skills were positively impacted by these activities under both modalities, with hybrid courses having higher ratings than both asynchronous courses and traditional pre-COVID course delivery. This information may assist construction management programs that are interested in developing hands-on experiential laboratory exercises using various teaching modalities.

        "description":"The United Nations has set forth an ambitious vision for education systems around the globe: cultivating life-long learning from early childhood through an individual's civic and work life. Schools must support children and youth in basic learning--including crucial socio-emotional, literacy, and numeracy competencies--to contribute to sustainable societies. However prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a severe learning crisis held back hundreds of millions of children. Analysts project that 9 out of 10 children in low-income countries and 5 out of 10 in middle-income countries will not develop core secondary education skills in literacy and numeracy by 2030 and the pandemic has only deepened the learning crisis and widened achievement gaps. Students also face daunting global challenges: rapidly evolving job demands, worsening inequality, and doubts over economic sustainability. This brief argues that policymakers and educators must grasp the levers of organizational change inside education institutions to rethink goals and lift school quality. Systems thinking offers key tools for leveraging gains inside classrooms and enriching the quality of teaching and student engagement. This brief shares differing pathways for sparking systems change and details country and state cases that have raised student learning by deploying the powerful tools of systems analysis.",

Compiled from data reported by government agencies and industry sources, HEPI measures the average relative level in the price of a fixed market basket of goods and services purchased by colleges and universities each year through current fund educational and general expenditures, excluding research. A more accurate indicator of cost changes for colleges and universities than the Consumer Price Index (CPI), HEPI is used primarily to project future budget increases required to preserve purchasing power. With compilations dating back to 1961, HEPI offers almost 60 continuous years of higher education inflation data. It is an essential tool enabling schools to determine increases in funding necessary to maintain both real purchasing power and investment. HEPI is compiled using data items from publicly available sources that are released at different points in the academic fiscal year, which runs from July 1 through the following June 30. This year's report shows, costs for a market basket of items making up those operating budgets increased at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in FY2022 compared with 2.7 percent in FY2021 (and 1.9 percent in FY2020). From a long-term perspective, it was the steepest annual increase in HEPI since 6.0 percent in 2001. This is not welcome data, but it does make clear the need to discuss and weigh matters related to inflation just like other high priority agenda topics. [For the 2021 Update, see ED617394.]",

This analysis used two quasi-experimental methods, Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) and fixed effects, to examine the impact of Zearn Math across [approximately]1,000 students who completed an average of 3+ Zearn Math lessons per week, during the 2018-2019, 2020-2021 and/or 2021-2022 school years. Findings showed that students who used Zearn Math consistently grew 36% more; the equivalent of 10.5 additional weeks of learning in one school year, as measured by the i-Ready Diagnostic. Students who started two or more years below grade-level had almost 2x the growth with consistent Zearn Math usage as similar students with low or no usage; the equivalent of an additional 23.7 weeks. Consistent Zearn Math usage was shown to result in a 32% reduction in summer slide, equivalent to five weeks of learning over the summer. Students with consistent Zearn Math usage in 2020-2021 maintained almost 75% of their additional growth a year after they stopped using Zearn Math. [The report was published by Zearn.]",

Throughout its history, the IB system has managed at least three ongoing tensions, which stem from its multifaceted aims and which the system has evolved to manage. These three tensions are between: (1) academic rigor and equitable access; (2) more traditional academic achievement and more holistic teaching and learning; and (3) providing supports to schools and teachers to promote fidelity of implementation and also permitting practitioners enough discretion for local adaptation. These tensions are especially apparent at three points in time throughout the IB system's reform journey: when IB began in the 1960s, when the Primary Years Programme was created in 1997, and when the PYP was enhanced in 2018. As enduring as these tensions may be, the IB system also offers policymakers lessons on how to manage them.

        "description":"The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBG Act, as amended) is the main federal law governing child care programs for low-income working families. The CCDBG Act authorizes discretionary appropriations to support grants to state, territorial, and tribal lead agencies. Lead agencies use these funds to subsidize the child care expenses of eligible children and to improve the overall quality and supply of child care. At the lead agency level, discretionary CCDBG funds are integrated with mandatory funds from the Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES). The CCES is permanently authorized in Section 418 of the Social Security Act. CCES funds generally must be spent according to CCDBG Act rules. Combined, the CCES and CCDBG are commonly called the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), and this report uses the term &quot;CCDF&quot; to refer to these joint funding streams, where appropriate. The CCDF is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This report addresses the following topics regarding the CCDBG: (1) Lead Agencies; (2) Subsidy Programs; (3) Quality Improvement Activities; (4) Licensing Requirements; (5) Health and Safety Standards; (6) Inspections; (7) Criminal Background Checks; (8) Consumer Education; (9) Limitations on Use of Funds; (10) Allocation of Funds; and (11) Funding and Children Served.",

        "description":"The Innovation Schools Act of 2008, § 22-32.5-102, et seq. C.R.S., was designed to provide a pathway for schools and districts to develop and implement innovative practices in a wide variety of areas and contexts to improve student outcomes. The Act provides a formal process that allows schools or groups of schools to make requests to their local school boards for waivers from district-level policies and for school boards to make requests to the Colorado State Board of Education for waivers from state-level laws and regulations. The Act enables schools to better provide educational services tailored to meet the needs of their student populations. Innovation schools are required to articulate a vision around the autonomies they are seeking, as well as to gain support from a variety of stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, and School Accountability Committee members, before receiving the innovation school designation. The innovation application process requires schools to think through the common goal and vision that will be made possible by receiving greater autonomy, as well as the policies and documents that will need to change when these innovations are implemented. In compliance with the requirements of § 22-32.5-111, C.R.S., the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) has prepared this annual report divided into the following parts: (1) Overview of the Innovation Schools Act of 2008; (2) Current Demographics of Innovation Schools; (3) Description of the Innovations Implemented; (4) Summary of the Academic Performance of Innovation Schools; and (5) Recommendations for Legislative Changes. This report builds on the format from previous years and typically includes a more detailed section regarding the academic performance of innovation schools and innovation school zones. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, state assessments and school performance frameworks in 2020 were suspended and therefore corresponding data is not available. For the 2020-21 school year, state assessments were administered to a limited number of grade levels. Therefore, achievement data is limited, and growth data is not available for this report. In response to disruptions created by COVID-19, Colorado paused the accountability frameworks for two school years (2020-21 and 2021-22). Thus, district and school plan types were carried over from 2019-20. Enrollment information for both districts and Innovation schools reflect a slight increase from the 2020-21 school year, but student populations are still lower than they were in the 2019-20 school year.

It also provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). The LHHS bill also provides funds for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). This report primarily focuses on regular FY2022 LHHS discretionary funding enacted during the annual appropriations process. This report is divided into several sections. The opening section provides an explanation of the scope of the LHHS bill (and hence, the scope of this report) and an introduction to important terminology and concepts that carry throughout the report. Next is a series of sections describing major congressional actions on FY2022 appropriations and (for context) a review of the conclusion of the FY2021 appropriations process. This is followed by a high-level summary and analysis of appropriations for FY2022, compared to FY2021 funding levels. The body of the report concludes with overview sections for each of the major titles of the bill: DOL, HHS, ED, and Related Agencies (RA).

        "description":"Although the history of translation is almost as old as the history of humankind, it was not until the second half of the twentieth century that translation studies were recognized as an independent discipline. Perhaps due to this fact, translation and interpreting programs at the higher education level started to be introduced in Turkey in the 1980s. These programs were English translation and interpreting programs. The first program to train Arabic translators and interpreters was opened at Kirikkale University in 2011 and remained the only program in its field until 2017. Between 2017 and 2023, nine more Arabic translation and interpreting programs, six at public universities and three at private universities, started actively admitting students. In this study, Arabic translation and interpreting programs in Turkey are examined from various angles. At the end of the study, it was concluded that the demand for the departments at state universities was higher, the students with the highest scores preferred Istanbul University. Interpreter and translator students scored an average of forty-two points in the eighty-question foreign language exam and there were an average of 3.8 faculty members in these programs. Eight faculty members work in these programs and the students who are admitted to them are mostly placed in universities in their home cities. The total capacity of the programs is sufficient and, although there is no unity in the curriculum of the programs, similar courses are offered in different classes. The programs focus on language skills for the first two years and, subsequently, focus on translation-oriented courses. At the end of the study, we make some suggestions for translation and interpreting programs by making associations with the findings of the related literature.",

        "author":["Saenz, David Arron"],
        "description":"There is a vast body of literature documenting the positive impacts that rater training and calibration sessions have on inter-rater reliability as research indicates several factors including frequency and timing play crucial roles towards ensuring inter-rater reliability. Additionally, increasing amounts research indicate possible links in rater-reliability and grade inflation pertaining to faculty status and length of employment. This research study analyzed the impact that consistent and collaborative training and rubric calibration, or the lack thereof, has on inter-rater reliability. Additionally, this study investigated whether faculty status and faculty length of employment has an influence on scoring reliability. Finally, participatory action research was planned to assist in the creation of a formal training policy and processed that could then be tested to explore the impact that such training would have on future examination rater-reliability. Five years of examination scoring data was utilized from a small Midwest region private graduate school. Intraclass correlation coefficient statistical analysis was employed to determine inter-rater reliability along with independent samples t-test to determine statistical significance the faculty groups. Mean scoring differences outputs were then tested utilizing a Likert-type scale to evaluate scoring gaps amongst faculty. The findings within this study indicate that inter-rater reliability is negatively impacted when no formal or consistent training. However, no significant differences between the mean scores were found based on faculty status nor between faculty length of employment. The hypothesis testing yielded support of the main hypothesis within this research study and the current literature in which inter-rater reliability is negatively impacted when no formal or consistent rater-training and rubric calibrations are performed for raters of examinations. The implications for practice resulting from this study display the need for formal training policy and processes be created, and consistently completed to ensure inter-rater reliability will be positively impacted.",

        "description":"This memorandum introduces a set of 10 principles--&quot;from&quot; states and &quot;for&quot; states--to inform the design and management of effective systems to improve or replace low-performing schools. The principles are derived from what is known based on current research, evidence, and experience, and the input of state leaders, key stakeholders, and other experts. To identify the principles, the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) began with what must be true at each level of the public education system--from what students must experience as learners to the critical roles played by schools, districts, authorizers, partners, and states. The principles also build on the CCSSO next-generation state accountability system principles that highlight the inextricable link between accountability and school improvement, including a focus on diagnostic reviews, targeted support for the lowest-performing schools (and their districts), and systems of continuous improvement to sustain progress over time.",

Our findings suggest that international students are generally satisfied with the support provided by their international student offices at their institutes of higher education, although they also identified several areas for improvement. In both the surveys and the focus groups, participants emphasized the need for practical assistance with finding housing in the United States and navigating the complexities of attaining a social security number so they can open bank accounts, buy cell phones, and apply for leases on apartments. They also discussed the need to foster the development of meaningful friendships with other international students as well as students from the United States and for ensuring that the mental/emotional health of students, as well as their academic progress, are looked after.

        "author":["Szymendera, Scott D."],
        "description":"The Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program provides cash benefits to federal, state, and local law enforcement officers; firefighters; employees of emergency management agencies; and members of emergency medical services agencies who are killed or permanently and totally disabled as the result of personal injuries sustained in the line of duty. The Public Safety Officers' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program, a component of the PSOB program, provides higher-education assistance to the children and spouses of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. The PSOB and PSOEA programs are administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). Claimants dissatisfied with denials of benefits may pursue administrative appeals within DOJ and may seek judicial review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Each year, Congress appropriates funding for PSOB death benefits, which is considered mandatory spending, and for PSOB disability benefits and PSOEA benefits, which is subject to annual appropriations. For FY2022, the one-time lump-sum PSOB death and disability benefit is $389,825 and the PSOEA monthly benefit for a student attending an educational institution full-time is $1,298. Public safety officers who contract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the line of duty may be eligible for PSOB benefits. The Safeguarding America's First Responders Act (S. 3607, P.L. 116-157) provides a presumption of PSOB eligibility for public safety officers who were on duty beginning January 1, 2020. On November 18, 2021, President Joe Biden signed into law the Protecting America's First Responders Act of 2021 (P.L. 117-61) which made numerous amendments to the PSOB and PSOEA programs as indicated in various places in this report. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Public Safety Officer Support Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-172), which expanded PSOB coverage to include, in certain cases, mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), disabilities caused by attempted suicides, and deaths caused by officer suicides.",

Three issues -- large-scale distance learning, financial fragility and race and equity -- are driving the immediate future of accreditation, perhaps leading to a rethinking of what &quot;quality&quot; means. There has been an unparalleled scale of distance learning offerings, growing numbers of institutions that are financially fragile now and that are likely to be in the future and an intensification of attention and needs in relation to race and equity.

Means, standard deviation, t-test, and Pearson's r-correlation were used to analyze the data. The results showed that while participants' level of learner autonomy before the pandemic was high, during the pandemic it was moderate. Additionally, the results from the LLS questionnaires showed that students used a moderate proportion of language learning strategies before and after the pandemic. Finally, the correlation analysis used to determine the relationship between the level of learner autonomy and LLS use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that there is a positive and linear relationship between the level of learner autonomy and LLS use.",

        "description":"As documented in chapters throughout this book, many promising and well-established interventions have been developed for treating even the most burdensome and debilitating mental health problems experienced by youth. Two overlapping realities, however, can interfere with the success of these interventions: (1) schools and communities rarely have enough resources to identify and provide intensive services for the large number of youth who experience severe emotional and behavioral problems; and (2) many youth who would benefit from early interventions to reduce risk go unnoticed and do not receive any services at all (see Herman, Merrill, Reinke, &amp; Tucker, 2004; Reinke, Herman, &amp; Tucker, 2006). It is exciting to have strategies that can help individuals overcome mental health problems. Without a broader approach, however, individual or group interventions will not impact the population health or reduce the incidence or prevalence of these conditions (Biglan, 1995). A public health approach provides a framework for influencing population health outcomes (Reinke et al., 2006). Although elements of a public health framework applied to children's mental health--including the idea of conceptualizing health promotion, prevention, and treatment along a continuum--have appeared in several prominent reports (National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine; NRC &amp; IOM, 2000; 2004; 2009), the application of fully integrated models remains challenging. In particular, universal approaches to mental health promotion and prevention are often foreign to mental health providers who have been trained to deliver services to individuals or small groups. In this chapter, we define universal prevention and situate it within a public health perspective. Next, we describe how this approach fits along a continuum of supports for students, ranging from minimal to intensive services, and show how this framework not only can reduce the number of students who will need intensive supports but also can help identify those most in need. We then describe examples of universal prevention models in school settings. We conclude with a discussion of barriers to universal prevention, potential solutions, and future directions.",

        "description":"The 2022 &quot;KIDS COUNT in Colorado!&quot; report reveals the momentous loss experienced by children and families across the state during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. It illustrates the pandemic's continued, far-reaching effects on Colorado kids--from difficulty accessing health care, child care, early learning opportunities, and K-12 education; to ongoing housing instability and other economic challenges. Among Colorado households with children, about half reported a loss of household income since the pandemic began, and one-third reported difficulty paying for usual household expenses, including medical care or food. Even amid the hardships of the pandemic, however, it is clear that policy change can make an enormous difference in the lives of children and families. The 2022 report offers policy recommendations that emphasize the need to increase public investment in programs that support the health and well-being of children across the state. Recommendations include investing in income support for families; expanding access to behavioral, mental, and physical health services; and investing in sustainable, adequate support for children's early learning and development. The report also highlights policy changes enacted since March 2020 that helped shield kids and families from the pandemic and accompanying economic downturn. The annual &quot;KIDS COUNT in Colorado!&quot; report tracks the well-being of Colorado children statewide and at the county level. The 29th annual report includes data and research on kids in the areas of health, early childhood, K-12 education, and family economic security. The report is a complement to the national KIDS COUNT Data Book produced by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which was released on Aug. 8. [For the 2021 report, see ED622563. For the &quot;KIDS COUNT Data Book, 2022: State Trends in Child Well-Being,&quot; see ED625969.]",

This report is a result of the workgroup's effort. The report's recommendations build on those from 2017's Colorado's Teacher Shortages strategic plan (ED586422), and the 2014 report Keeping Up With the Kids. Recommended strategies include investing in &quot;grow your own&quot; strategies and addressing long-standing concerns about compensation; providing mentorship opportunities for aspiring teachers and investing in preparation programs at colleges and universities serving students of color and supporting districts to implement culturally relevant and sustainable practices to address implicit bias and microaggressions in the classroom and workplace. This report continues to underscore the importance of clear and focused support on recruiting, preparing, and retaining a diverse educator workforce. There is no single, statewide solution to the challenge. Instead, there are multiple possible solutions tailored to fit the assets and needs of different communities and different parts of the state. It is the shared belief of workgroup members that all Colorado students will benefit from being served by educators that resemble the racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity of the community.

The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act (2021) provides a $122 billion historic federal investment to help states and districts safely reopen schools while addressing students' academic, social, and emotional learning in response to COVID-19. CASEL has recommended three priority areas for social and emotional learning (SEL) investment that can assist states and districts in optimizing ARP for student success: (1) Promote SEL for students; (2) Support adult SEL competencies and capacity building; and (3) Align SEL efforts across schools, families, and communities. This &quot;Bright Spots&quot; brief highlights policy innovations around Priority Area 1 through state investments in evidence-based SEL to support academic recovery and social and emotional wellbeing, the need for which was made abundantly clear by COVID-19. It also spotlights state ARP spending plans in 12 states.",

This 10th edition of the League's CEO Tenure and Retention Study covers the most recent period since their last report from October 2020. Fall 2020 through summer/early fall of 2022 included the following: (1) the impact of the global pandemic emanating from the devastating spread of the COVID-19 virus; (2) a volatile state budgetary environment; (3) political, social, and cultural strife perhaps most visible on January 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol seeking to overthrow the results of the November 2020 presidential election; and (4) a racial reckoning and backlash featuring the Black Lives Matter movement, and domestic political conflict permeating all manner of social relations including education at all levels. Among the key findings were: (1) More than 1,200 individuals have served in executive leadership roles; (2) 4 of the 5 longest-serving leaders are women; (3) In April 2020, 45.4 percent of CEOs were women (59 women CEOs); (4) 21.4 percent of CEOs identify as Latina/o; and (5) In the last 10 years, the average tenure of a permanent CEO was 5.1 years.

OnPath facilitated a powerful combination of people and knowledge by bringing together college staff members with operational knowledge about what needs to change, evidence from rigorous MDRC research about what helps students persist in college, and facilitators from MDRC's Center for Applied Behavioral Science. Through a series of workshops, one-on-one coaching sessions, and evidence-based templates of messaging strategies, researchers collaborated with staff members to: (1) develop student outreach campaigns that simplified registration information, connected students to available financial aid, and encouraged continuous enrollment based on prior rigorous evidence about what works to encourage enrollment; and (2) design new student-centered strategies to improve student persistence during the pandemic. The messaging strategies were informed by best practices and research evidence from MDRC evaluations. These integrated approaches enabled colleges to implement new messaging campaigns to better address students' needs and begin to implement new policies to reduce barriers to student success.",

In supporting dialogue and action, this guide also seeks to model it. The model used is borrowed from the California Education Policy Fellowship Program (EPFP), which convenes a group of education leaders annually to meet and network several times during the year. These professionals work in K-12 schools, higher education, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations. They include teachers, faculty, staff, administrators, researchers, and policy specialists. They come together from across their roles in education to: (1) identify and discuss broad challenges and opportunities facing education in California; (2) examine student data and research that can inform these deliberations; (3) expand their knowledge of state, system, and institutional policy across K-12 and higher education; and (4) diversify their statewide networks to take advantage of opportunities for educational advancement in California.

The study was conducted among 478 university students through a causal-comparative research design. The participants were obtained through convenience sampling method which is one of the techniques of probability sampling. The study employed the Questionnaire for Participation in Recreational Activities, Leisure Satisfaction Scale and Sensation Seeking Scales to collect data for this research. In the evaluation of the data, along with descriptive statistics, Independent Samples t-Test and ANOVA were used. To determine the relationship between leisure satisfaction and sensation seeking, Pearson Correlation test and to determine the impact Regression analysis were used. The findings revealed no significant difference between leisure satisfaction and sensation seeking among university students in terms of gender and year of study. Another finding showed that, while there was a significant difference between participation in active sports, social, artistic and cultural activities and leisure satisfaction, no significant difference was found for sensation seeking. Finally, students' sensation seeking significantly affected their leisure satisfaction. [For the full proceedings, see ED626375.]",

Consistent users were matched to low- or non-users on pre-Nebraska Student Centered Assessment System (NSCAS) scores in English and Math, grade, and seven academic or demographic factors. In comparison to matched low- or non-users, consistent Zearn Math users gained an additional 25 scale score points on the NSCAS (effect size=0.40) and were more likely to increase their proficiency level.

Supervisory modality, function, and approaches are interrelated to the responsibilities of a supervisor. It can be divided into four sets: those related to the progress of the candidate, mentoring, coaching in the study subject, study methodology, and how to write the thesis and sponsorship of the student's involvement in academic or regular exercise. Respectable supervisory applies aid students to achieve their potential and add to the University's research outline. A good supervisor cannot be a scientific adviser on topics on which he does not have in-depth specialized knowledge. It is possible to find an explanation for the fact that the supervisor leads PhD students in various scientific specialties.

However, vision is one of the most essential senses to access information. Therefore, children with visual impairments face significant challenges in accessing information and participate into educational activities. This leads to a number of barriers for people with visual impairments in becoming fully independent individuals in everyday life . The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of how vision influence children with visual impairments, how they should be educated and what they should be educated about. This discussion leads on a further discussion if an additional curriculum, apart from the national curriculum, is needed for students with visual impairments in Turkey. Therefore, an overview of important developments in creating the Expanded Core Curriculum (ECC) in the USA is provided. Moreover, this paper will give an overview of each ECC area and discuss why the ECC is crucial in education and everyday life of people with visual impairments in Turkey.",

The study examined data systems for monitoring teacher demand and supply data, such as district position vacancies by certification area, candidate recruitment, and the performance and productivity of educator preparation programs. Information on supply and demand data systems best practices was collected through a literature review and interviews with a convenience sample of five West Virginia educator preparation programs and three teacher residency programs from across the country. The study found that effective state data systems tracked school district-level teacher certification areas in which there were shortages and overages of graduates and shared these data with the state's educator preparation programs. Other key data included measures of educator candidate diversity and quality, the quality of educator preparation programs, program graduate placement and effectiveness as teachers, and their retention in school districts and the teaching profession. The study highlights data system recommendations from the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Council on Teacher Quality. Implementing high-quality teacher supply and demand data systems provides states with an effective tool for addressing teacher shortages.

        "description":"The university aims to form professionals through transmission and dissemination of knowledge, therefore, the Extension, as a tool of the universities, has a major role contributing to improvements in the learning and teaching process. The Extension projects are extremely important for The Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR), since they increase the scope of citizens, benefiting them with research and knowledge. The project 'Qualifying Students in private and public schools from Apucarana for the Brazilian Mathematical Olympics for Public and Private Schools (OBMEP)', was designed with the objective of developing logical thinking in students, that participate on the project, as well increasing their interest in mathematics through the application of various activities, thereby helping to reduce the discrepancies in the learning process. The project also has the purpose to increase the number of qualified students for the second phase and medalists of the Maths Olympics. The idea is to provide ways to entertain students, trying to introduce greater dynamics to their studies. In 2019, some students of the project were awarded scholarships by the Institutional Program of Scientific Initiation Scholarships (PIBIC Jr), in which the scholarship's holder help in the development of research at the university. During the project, significant improvements of the participating students were noted, both in the school's grade and in the results of the Maths Olympics. The project was indeed beneficial for everyone (students and volunteers) since there was personal and academic growth for those who were willing to teach. With the progress of this project, the importance of the University Extension for the community became evident, since it is keen to contribute to the intellectual and personal growth of each individual involved.

We aim to clarify the stimulus factors to acquire financial knowledge and stimulus factors to change financial behavior and demonstrate their importance to incorporate in the game design by integrating psychological theory and empirical findings from the survey of 135 students of Provincial Electricity Authority Electric Vocational School (PEAEVS) aged between 16-19 years old during April 2020. All responses were analyzed through factor analysis and regression analysis methods. The empirical study found seven factors that motivate and effectively facilitate financial education of these young adult learners: (1) awareness for the need of financial skills; (2) awareness for financial planning; (3) future uncertainty; (4) financial satisfaction; (5) communities support; (6) income satisfaction; and (7) keeping track of expenses and budgeting. Regression analysis concluded that the need for competency and income satisfaction are highly related to willingness to study financial skills and change financial behavior. The result will be integrated into a framework for further develop innovative financial learning tools. [For the full proceedings, see ED626375.]",

        "description":"This study focused on aligning the Bachelor of Early Childhood Education Curriculum Components per PPST to come up a teacher quality framework for ECE pre-service teachers in the Philippines. Using unpacking of beginning teachers' indicators (BTIs) in PPST and content analysis, distinct competencies were ascertained. A total of eight participants were commissioned as panel of experts to unpack the BTI&quot;s in the PPST. Based on the result of the study, thirteen distinct competencies were identified to be included in the teacher quality framework, namely: a) demonstrate learnedness the content of ECE specifically the holistic development and learning of the children, b) apply teaching strategies that are developmental and play-based in all learning areas to include ICT and mother tongue to facilitate the teaching-learning of the children, c) develop skills in networking and collaboration with relevant stakeholders to improve learning programs practices, d)inculcate the value of respect in diversity in school and whole community, e) display pride and commitment on professional ethics, f) display pride and commitment as early childhood educators, g) set-up a nurturing and inclusive learning environment for children, h) design conducive environment for learning and development, i) implement differentiated and developmentally appropriate practice for diverse children, j) prepare responsive ECE learning programs, k) address learning goals and outcomes by applying systematic use of appropriate assessment tools and methods, l) able to work collaboratively to improve teaching practice, and m) demonstrate understanding on systematic use of appropriate assessment tools and methods. Hence, the teacher quality framework designed for ECE pre-service teachers may be put-upon as practical guide for the Teacher Education Institutions in order to prepare their graduates the beginning competencies needed when they are employed in the field.

        "description":"The integration of innovative interdisciplinary approaches to the ?-12 Curriculum aims to deepen students' knowledge and help them develop transversal skills. Applying an interdisciplinary lens, with a focus on pandemics, can help shape attitudes by means of inculcating the values of responsible global citizenship, and a high sense of personal and social responsibility. In the midst of the current lock-down due to Covid-19, a teaching approach to pandemics is presented, as an interdisciplinary connection between history and mathematics, based on the methodology of modeling in mathematics and the humanities. The main research questions posed: a) can modeling, as analyzed in the scientific literature, be used to interpret pandemics, e.g. in the case of the 'plague of Athens' (430 B.C.), as analyzed in the primary sources? b) Can the mathematical tools of statistical analysis be used to understand prevention measures through the centuries? Taking a longue durée perspective on history, students were asked to work on additional cases of pandemics across time and space, mobilizing both their mathematical and historical knowledge: process numerical data from primary sources, study maps, combine and compare elements of the past and the present using mathematical epidemiological models and real numerical data to study and predict the spread of infectious diseases. This paper presents the assessment of the effectiveness of this approach, conducted by means of closed and open questionnaires, administered in two phases (pre- and post-teaching) to a sample of 40 students aged 16-17 years. The results highlight statistics as a key tool for understanding real-world situations, and record the strengthening of students' knowledge in history, the raising of their critical thinking skills, as well as their enhanced ability to tackle real-world problems and understand responsible decision-making processes. Finally, the paper suggests that such good practices can prepare students for the complexity of globalized knowledge. [For the full proceedings, see ED626375.]",

State leaders have long used this information as a proxy for student economic disadvantage--yet this data is insufficient to understand and address students' needs. Measures based on FRL data lack critical nuance about students' experiences and have become an increasingly inaccurate proxy for families' economic disadvantage. As leaders work to provide students with necessary support and understand the systemic factors that influence poverty, access to opportunities, and individual outcomes, they need the full picture of the challenges that students face.

Universities of all sizes, demographics, and varying cultural identities or Carnegie classification scramble every day to stay ahead of the fray of an invasive contagion. The pandemic threatens enrollment, brings questions about quality teaching and learning, and has resulted in mental health decline of faculty and students, fluctuating directives from boards, and the ever-present awareness that these conditions will perhaps persist for a year or more. All of these &quot;unpredictables&quot; are frightening for institutions that operate from the lens of consistency and stabilized structures. One such constant in higher education is the assurance of quality in operations and academic programming.

        "description":"The Cowen Institute has published the &quot;State of Public Education in New Orleans&quot; (&quot;SPENO&quot;) annually since 2007, with a pause for two years after the March 2020 report because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2022-2023 has marked a return to a more familiar school environment. This report works to capture some of the changes, accomplishments, setbacks, and gains that have occurred in public education in New Orleans since the start of the pandemic. This report is a snapshot of public education in the current academic year using aggregated data from publicly available sources to inform a wide audience that includes educators, families, and students, as well as policymakers and the general public. Unlike previous years, information on teacher demographics and transportation is not included as there is not updated aggregated data available from the Louisiana Department of Education on these topics. The authors believe that there is value in summarizing data on New Orleans education from publicly available sources and putting that together in one place. They hope this report can be used as a jumping-off point to a deeper exploration of these extremely nuanced subject areas and a resource for open and informed discussions among stakeholders.

This guidebook is an internal document written specifically for providers of Speech-Language Pathology. The procedures and best practices in this guidebook are designed to provide optimal school-based interventions as part of a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE), following IDEA 2004 while simultaneously maximizing equal access to speech-language pathologists for all of the District of Columbia Public Schools students. In this guidebook, providers will find guidelines, procedures, suggestions, and ideas that should be used daily to guide them in assuring a high level of professional services for all students and invested stakeholders. Implicit within this document is the following core principles: (1) The criteria for eligibility must include both the presence of a composite depressed score and documented impact on the student's access to the academic curriculum; (2) Services should not be instituted until accommodations have been implemented and given a chance to work; (3) The intensity and modalities of interventions should dwindle over time (4) The default delivery service need not be 1:1, unless otherwise required and justified, as applicable, by the clinician; and (5) Discharge from services should be stated at the first IEP meeting as a desirable and celebrated outcome and not a denial of services; discharge may, and should, occur at any time in the process.

To form the experiment and control groups, &quot;Conflict Resolution Behavior Determination Scale&quot; was applied to 135 students who are studying at European University of Lefke, Guidance and Psychological Counselling Department and those who got the highest score were selected. The research was conducted with 31 students which 16 of them were in experiment and 15 of them were in control group. The pretest-posttest design with control group was used in the research. Conflict Resolution Behavior Determination Scale which was adapted by Koruklu (1998) was used to gather data. This scale is a self-assessment scale and its application time is approximately 20 minutes. Conflict resolution training was given to 16 students in the experiment group but nothing was done for the students in control group. This training had 9 sessions and each session lasted almost 50 minutes. &quot;t-test&quot; and &quot;two way analysis of variance for repeated measures&quot; were used for the meaning of the difference between groups' points in data analysis. After 1 week completing the conflict resolution training which was given to the experimental group, &quot;Conflict Resolution Behavior Determination Scale&quot; was applied to both groups as posttest. The results showed that the program was effective and the students' who are in control group conflict resolution skills rose as constructive reaction. Findings were discussed in consideration of information in literature.",

        "description":"The article explores how Nepalese public schools' traditional hierarchy-dominated educational culture shapes teachers' professional growth and sense of identity. Through the narrative inquiry approach, I explored teachers 'professional identity development using Gee's (2000) identity framework. The data revealed that hierarchy and power relations between the teachers and the social context fundamentally shaped teacher identity development. However, the study further showed that professional hierarchy was not uni-layered, the power was not one-directional, and the domination was not permanent but rather dynamic. Factors like academic qualifications, job status, technological skills, and social status made the hierarchy complex. More interestingly, hierarchical relationships did not always undermine teacher empowerment but confidence in some cases. For example, when a teacher in a marginalized position due to some factors such as poor health condition was viewed as a role model or capable of success despite challenges, they achieved high value from their colleagues.",

These polls are designed to provide a snapshot about how parents, guardians, and the general public view New Orleans' highly decentralized K-12 public education system. Each year, the Cowen Institute asks some new questions about the most relevant and pressing issues facing educators and families. They also carry over questions from previous polls to assess how opinions change over time on a few key topics. Beginning last year, the Cowen Institute began releasing the poll findings in a series of briefs. Prior to 2021, they had presented the complete findings for a given year in a single comprehensive report. They made the change to make the data more accessible and digestible for the general public -- the briefs allow to group findings by topic, enabling to surface trends about particular areas of the city's education system. This is the first of two briefs they will release on their poll this year. This brief covers general perceptions about New Orleans K-12 public education; the second brief (ED626431) will delve more deeply into specific areas of education. To capture the experiences and attitudes of a wide range of parents, as they have done since 2020, the Cowen Institute polled 1,000 public and private school parents and guardians in Orleans Parish, as well as a small number who homeschool their children.",

As such, opportunities to learn computational thinking are important to all students--not only the ones who will eventually study computer science or enter the information technology industry. However, large inequalities continue to exist in access to equipment and learning opportunities needed to build computational thinking skills for students that experience marginalization. We call all educators to integrate computational thinking into disciplinary learning across PreK-12 education, while centering inclusivity, to equip students with the skills they need to participate in our increasingly technological world and promote justice for students and society at large. This report issues two calls to action for educators to design inclusive computing learning opportunities for students: (1) integrate computational thinking into disciplinary learning, and (2) build capacity for computational thinking with shared leadership and professional learning. Inspired by the frameworks, strategies, and examples of inclusive computational thinking integration, readers can take away practical implications to reach learners in their contexts.",

School leaders play a fundamental role in recruiting and supporting strong educators, driving rigorous instruction, creating school cultures that are inclusive and inviting, and working toward positive academic outcomes. School leaders of color, in particular, provide strong instructional leadership while creating an equity-oriented school environment and attracting and retaining more teachers of color, from which all students benefit-- especially students of color. Importantly, when school leaders of color lead students of color, these positive effects are magnified. District and state leaders can support and create pipelines for current educators to become school leaders. This document provides state and district leaders with an overview of the following five things they should do to foster opportunities to cultivate strong and diverse school leaders of color: (1) Set clear goals to increase school leader diversity and make diversity data more visible to stakeholders; (2) Strengthen existing teacher pipelines that will in turn build principal pipelines; (3) Develop high quality preparation programs for school leaders; (4) Develop high quality professional development opportunities for school leaders; and (5) Invest in principal retention strategies.",

Methods: Three instruments were used to compare pre-COVID-19 school librarian practice with its evolution during two specific points during the pandemic. High School Librarian Survey 1 (Pre-COVID) (S1) provided a baseline view into the pre-COVID-19 practice of purposively sampled participants; open-ended Survey 2 (S2) and a follow-up focus group (FG) uncovered their practice at two specific points during the crisis and explored how librarians' priorities shifted. Results: The instruments which collected librarian perceptions, revealed that while librarians supported and contributed to their learning communities in essential ways, they were also forced to compromise their priorities. Librarians furthered their leadership roles, supported learning communities, exhibited resilience and integrity, and worked to assure equitable access to learning tools and reading materials. Yet, these efforts went largely unreported. Limited contact with teacher partners and classrooms compromised librarians' engagement with information literacy and inquiry instruction. Implications: Recommendations for future research include exploring how recognized gaps in information literacy learning and instruction may have been recovered since the pandemic and how school librarians' roles may have shifted and been impacted by the pandemic. Resources: Research instruments are collected on this LibGuide. https://comminfo.libguides.com/FirstYearsFrames/ResearchInstruments",

In line with this, the government of PRC shows a serious intention to learn Indonesian language by sending their students to learn the Indonesian language in Indonesia through BIPA program. The success of BIPA learning depends on the learners' first language and teaching materials used. Therefore, in-depth studies on the linguistic characteristics of the BIPA learners are necessary to be conducted to acquire suitable teaching materials following the learners' needs. This research was conducted on eight students of BIPA for academic purposes program from China. This research was conducted by applying a qualitative descriptive approach. The findings on the linguistic characteristics of the BIPA students from China show three aspects. First, from the aspect of phonology, Chinese students do not really master the consonant sound pronunciation of Indonesian language, which is apparent from the inability and consistent mispronunciation in pronouncing certain sounds. Second, from the aspect of morphology, the students can construct words with some affixes that form the active form, but can't construct word using affixes that form the passive form. Third, the students have been able to construct a simple and complex sentence with two clauses, yet, they face difficulties in changing an active sentence to passive and vice versa. The three findings were then used to map the BIPA teaching materials, which later will be used for Chinese students in the future. [For the full proceedings, see ED626375.]",

Hip-hop's melding with digital media means that students and scholars alike must keep abreast of citation style changes and continually investigate what counts as evidence in the classroom. This involves considering the ways in which popular culture, namely hip-hop, can help students learn about notions of truth and evidence. Further, hip-hop's ready use of wordplay encourages constant critical inquiry into issues of truthfulness, authenticity, and evidence. Thus, hip-hop offers exciting opportunities to investigate citation and argument in the classroom, even though hip-hop is open to critique. [For the full proceedings, see ED626375.]",

This report examines faculty diversity relative to student diversity, as well as hiring equity, tenure equity, and changes in faculty representation over time for Black and Latino faculty at public, four-year institutions, and highlights colleges and universities that are making progress on diversifying their faculties and those that have more work to do. The findings show that Black and Latino faculty are severely underrepresented at most public, four-year colleges and universities. When Black and Latino faculty are compared against student enrollment in 2020, it is found that more than half (57%) the institutions had failing grades for Black faculty diversity, while nearly four out of five (80%) had F grades for Latino faculty diversity. If institutions are going to increase faculty diversity, they will need to examine their hiring and retention practices, improve campus racial climates, and make resources available to faculty members of color, so they can build and hone their skills and find community. This report offers a variety of other recommendations for institutional leaders, advocates, and federal and state policymakers on building faculty diversity via funding and strategic planning and campus climate initiatives.",

To provide advocates and policymakers with context on this important issue, Ed Trust partnered with New Leaders to conduct a statewide and district-specific analysis of student and school leader demographics in Georgia public schools. This state has the potential to develop a strong pipeline of school leaders from diverse backgrounds: In addition to having a racially and geographically diverse student population, Georgia is home to 10 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and 10 current or emerging Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs).

        "description":"While the majority of U.S students are children of color, only 20% of teachers are people of color. What's more, 40% of the nation's public schools do not have a single teacher of color on record. Research shows that all students, regardless of race or ethnicity, benefit socially, emotionally, and academically from a diverse teacher workforce. Yet, teachers of color are more likely to experience burnout and leave the profession at higher rates than their White peers. Amid rising censorship efforts, teacher shortages, and declines in enrollment to teacher preparation programs, state leaders must find effective ways to diversify their educator workforce and boost student outcomes by recruiting, supporting, and retaining more educators of color. More than 100 educators of color developed action plans for their respective states to increase teacher diversity. This brief shares three policy levers that educators of color identified, with proposed solutions and best practices: (1) make educator diversity data visible and actionable to stakeholders; (2) set clear goals at the state, district, and teacher preparation level to increase educator diversity; and (3) invest in efforts to retain teachers of color that improve working conditions and provide opportunities for personal and professional growth.

The purpose of this brief is to: (1) share potential challenges regarding the implementation of universal dyslexia screening for English learners (ELs) and (2) highlight considerations that ensure English learners are appropriately screened given their language development trajectory and the foundational literacy instruction ELs have received. Furthermore, the brief offers considerations for the appropriate interpretation and use of screener results when districts are required to universally screen for dyslexia, including for students who have limited oral language development and little to no knowledge of English phonemes. This brief focuses specifically on English learners, whose foundational literacy trajectory is different than that of English-speaking children. Although dyslexia screeners can be useful for identifying students at risk for reading difficulties in English, they may mismeasure or fail to capture English learners' pre-literacy skills, which can comprise different levels of development in English and in their home language.",

The specific recommendations, and the numerous state examples and resources provided, identify policy opportunities for states to advance comprehensive school mental health (CSMH) systems -- a multi-tiered approach that integrates mental health services and supports within school settings and uses school-community collaborations to provide a continuum of mental health services. A broad range of experts on education, health, substance use, parent and family partnership, racial equity, and other related areas helped to inform policy opportunities along three system-building stages: establishing infrastructure and priorities, building structure and scale, and promoting effective implementation. They focus specifically on how the governor and state legislators -- as well as select state agency directors such as the chief state school officer, state secretary of health and human services, and state Medicaid director -- can set a promising policy foundation and, through collaboration, drive sustained and effective school strategies.

Great City School districts that have embraced the challenge of educating America's urban children have recognized the value of benchmarking their performance and growth against the progress of others. This report presents a number of different ways that member districts can analyze the data themselves by disaggregating results, showing trends, and combining variables. The companion online dashboard adds the ability to conduct several comparisons and analysis beyond what is presented in this report. To access this system, go to www.edwires.org. This report focuses on the data collection and analysis of the following Academic KPIs: (1) Pre-K enrollment relative to Kindergarten enrollment; (2) Algebra I completion rates for credit by grade 9; (3) Ninth grade course failure rates -- at least one core course; (4) Ninth graders with B average (GPA) or better; (5) Absentee rates by grade level; (6) Suspension rates; (7) Instructional days missed per 100 students due to suspensions; (8) AP participation rates; (9) AP-equivalent participation rates; (10) AP exam pass rates; and (11) Four-year graduation rate.

        "description":"Since March 2021, school district leaders have been developing and implementing plans to spend their &quot;ARP dollars,&quot; that is, the historic $122 billion allocated from the American Rescue Plan to help districts recover from the devastating effects of the pandemic. The money, also referred to as ESSER funds (Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief), is intended to help with schools' reopening and recovery. But the district planning and spending processes have been murky and difficult to follow. Some districts clearly report ARP spending on their websites, while others lack detail, leaving advocates and families wondering where all this federal money is going. Also unclear is whether districts are spending their funds on programs and practices rooted in evidence, and if they are prioritizing equity -- that is, targeting funds to students who need it most. This federal investment is crucial for students, especially students of color and students from low-income backgrounds, who are not only more likely to live in communities most impacted by the pandemic, but also who have been long underserved by our nation's schools. This guide is designed to help advocates ask district leaders questions about the details of their ARP spending plans to ensure their school district is prioritizing rigor and equity and using funds on practices and strategies that have been proven to work.",

        "description":"The concept of motivational regulation has always been on the agenda of researchers; however, the role of motivational regulation has received relatively little attention in terms of writing skills. Hence, the present study aims to investigate the potential correlations between motivational writing regulation strategies concerning collaborative writing beliefs of undergraduate L2 writers. To this end, a total of 102 undergraduate L2 writers were surveyed. To collect the data, two research tools were used. The first one is &quot;the Writing Strategies for Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire&quot; (&quot;WSSRLQ&quot;) (Teng and Zhang 2016a). This questionnaire conceptualizes motivational writing regulation strategies in terms of cognitive, metacognitive, and social-behavioral factors. The second data collection tool employed in the present study was the &quot;Collaborative Learning Beliefs Survey,&quot; which was prepared based on Roskams (1999). According to the findings of the study, there is a correlation between self-regulated writing strategies and collaborative learning beliefs. Hence, it is suggested that EFL writing instructions focus on motivational regulation strategies and other aspects of self-regulated strategies to ensure effective L2 writing instruction.",

        "description":"Students have many options as they leave high school and enter postsecondary education or the workforce. But during the six years that the Data Quality Campaign has reviewed report cards from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, it has been found that states have struggled to provide a robust picture of all of these options on their report cards. Instead, states have historically focused on information about students who move from K-12 education directly to four-year, public universities. Report cards can provide clarity about a student's options by providing information on the pathways that students in their district and state have taken--and their readiness to do so. States should prioritize collecting and sharing information on all of a student's postsecondary readiness opportunities and outcomes in ways that help students make the best decisions for their futures. This report briefly presents what was found in the 2021 review of report cards. [For &quot;Show Me the Data 2022 Deep Dive: Data for Equity,&quot; see ED629865.

        "author":["Burge, Jennifer Gruening"],
        "description":"This study was designed to understand the factors that influenced undergraduate students to return to a midwestern private university for their second year. The study was designed to (1) explore how undergraduate students identify and describe the factors that influenced them to return to the university for their second year, and (2) explore how the factors that influenced students to return to the university for a second year differ by demographic group. The study was guided by two research questions: (1) What factors influenced undergraduate students' decisions to return to the university for a second year? (2) How do the factors that influenced undergraduate students to return to the university for a second year differ by demographic group? This study was unique in that it focused on the whole student experience and the aspects of the institution that influenced their return to the university. The theoretical framework that guided the study was Tinto's (1993) model of student departure. The study was designed as a quantitative study using action research through survey research. The Fall 2021 Retention Survey was administered to students who entered the institution in the Fall 2020 semester and chose to return for their second year in Fall 2021. The results demonstrated that the student's decisions were influenced by academic factors, social factors, and financial factors. There were some differences in how the students described their experiences when the results were reviewed by race/ethnicity, gender identity, first-generation status, college with which they identified, and financial need. Implications for practice include establishing support structures for faculty and staff, such as professional development workshops, and reviewing student financial aid awards.",

Using a collaborative, multi-phased, mixed methods approach, the research examines how teachers are managed in policy and practice in refugee hosting areas in Kenya. This report explores the management practices of teachers in public schools in the surrounding host communities as well as in camp schools. It is also important to understand teacher management practice in the wider context of the Kenyan government's goal of inclusion -- to bring camp schools into the national system and under government management. The study identifies promising commitments, practices and gaps in order to reveal potential areas for further development and successful implementation of policies to support effective teacher management in refugee settings.

The brief highlights their perspectives about what steps can be taken to ensure children across America have safe schools and classrooms for their learning. This poll was conducted between June 15-June 21, 2022 among a sample of 2,198 Adults and June 15-June 25, 2022 among a sample of 1,000 Teachers. The interviews were conducted online and the data were weighted to approximate a target sample of Adults based on gender, educational attainment, age, race, and region. The poll found that roughly one out of four adults -- and a similar proportion of school parents -- believe that it is likely gun violence will occur at their local school sometime in the next school year. Teachers tend to be much more supportive of policies that have been proposed to reduce school shootings. While parents are much more likely than the general public to support their school district allowing teachers/administrators to carry a firearm/gun in school, only one out of five teachers indicate they would carry a gun in school if allowed.

Research shows that sustained and significant increases in school funding can have a lasting positive impact on student achievement and other outcomes -- especially for students from low-income backgrounds. Yet, the U.S. education system is plagued with persistent and longstanding funding inequities -- with the majority of states sending the fewest number of resources to the districts and schools that actually need the most resources. This analysis examines how revenues of districts serving the most students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, or English learners compare with those of their counterparts in each state and across the country. The analyses compare the average revenues of districts grouped into quartiles based on the student demographic characteristics. This report helps to provide decisionmakers with a clear roadmap for creating policies that can transform state funding systems into vehicles to address racial, socioeconomic, and sociocultural inequities.

        "description":"Part-time workers' earnings are much lower than those of their full-time counterparts, a difference often referred to as the part-time wage penalty. The mean hourly wage of part-time workers is only two-thirds that of full-time workers. Despite this wage penalty, there were no significant differences between part- and full-time workers in literacy skills and only modest differences in numeracy skills scores. This report uses new information about the literacy and numeracy skills of part-time workers to explore the connection between these skills and part-time workers' wages. The first section provides a descriptive review of part-time employment in the U.S. labor market, with emphasis on the part-time wage penalty among professional workers. It provides a unique perspective on the wage penalty as we can include not only measures of full- and part-time wages, but also full- and part-time worker literacy and numeracy skills. These issues are explored in this third paper in The Impact of Human Capital in the American Labor Market Series. The report, commissioned by the ETS Center for Research on Human Capital and Education, examines the association between wages and skills in the part-time labor market and is based on analysis of 2012-2014 data from the Survey of Adult Skills of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), an assessment measuring achievement in key domains, including literacy and numeracy, for countries across the world. Following up on the series' initial report, &quot;Skills and Earnings in the Full-Time Labor Market. The Impact of Human Capital in the American Labor Market Series&quot; (ED593028) which discovered a consistent and strong effect of literacy and numeracy skills on the wages of American full-time workers, the authors have found that, the overall effect of skills on the wages of part-time workers, too, were consistent and strong. They also found the skills of part-time workers to be similar on average to those of full-time workers, although wide variations existed among occupational sectors.

North Carolina has recognized the importance of increasing diversity in the workforce and despite national and local efforts from school districts and policy makers, the teaching workforce has remained largely white and female, even as the students they serve have become increasingly diverse, widening the racial gap between teachers and students. Although attempts have been made to increase the numbers of teachers of color, the nation's public schools are far from reflecting the diversity of the student populations they serve. Among many barriers that may contribute to this mismatch, this brief focuses on four areas: preparation, debt accumulation, completion, and retention.

        "description":"Black students are more likely to take on debt, borrow higher amounts, and struggle with repayment than their peers, because they generally have fewer resources to pay for college, thanks to the ongoing generational effects of systemic racism. This debt burden has far-reaching financial consequences, and many Black borrowers are unable to afford their monthly payments. Federal income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which are meant to make monthly payments manageable, often do anything but and can be ineffective at reducing a borrower's debt burden over time. This brief looks at the ways that existing IDR plans are failing Black borrowers and highlights the need for Congress and the Biden administration to cancel more student debt, overhaul income-driven repayment plans, double the Pell Grant, and create federal-state partnerships to address affordability in a comprehensive way. It also focuses on the experiences of Black borrowers and the toll the student debt crisis is taking on them. [For a comprehensive report based on the study, see &quot;Jim Crow Debt: How Black Borrowers Experience Student Loans&quot; (ED617539).]",

        "description":"Teacher diversity is beneficial for all students, but especially students of color. The evidence is clear that having a teacher that matches students' racial identity increases reading and math scores, reduces the use of exclusionary discipline practices, and increases the likelihood of graduating high school and matriculating into a postsecondary institution. Knowing these positive impacts, many policymakers share the same goal of increasing teacher diversity. In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper singed Executive Order Number 113 to establish the Developing a Representative and Inclusive Vision for Education (or DRIVE) Task Force, charged with creating and sustaining a diverse educator workforce. Efforts such as these also highlight the complexity of the issues that make it difficult to increase the diversity. This brief seeks to address the importance of promoting a diverse teacher workforce by presenting the current state of teacher diversity in North Carolina and highlighting the benefits that it has on student outcomes. The brief concludes with recommendations for increasing teacher diversity among the educator workforce in North Carolina.",

        "description":"Teachers are the most important school-based factor for student growth and achievement. Yet, for years, enrollment in the nation's schools of education has been in decline, and local education agencies (LEAs) have struggled to retain teachers. In many places, the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated these issues, requiring states to consider not only how they can fill vacancies, but also re-build a stronger and more diverse teacher pipeline moving forward. Missouri has not been immune to these challenges, with close to eight percent of its available full-time teaching positions in the 2020-21 school year either vacant or filled by individuals who were not fully qualified. To address the state's teacher shortage, the Missouri State Board of Education (State Board) formed the Teacher Recruitment and Retention Blue Ribbon Commission. This report outlines the Commission's recommendations to the State Board for addressing teacher recruitment and retention and strengthening the teaching profession in Missouri overall.",

The interviews were conducted online and the data were weighted to approximate a target sample of adults based on gender, educational attainment, age, race, and region. Among the key findings are: (1) Although there has been an ongoing surge of COVID cases with the emergence of the Omicron variant, the percentages of Americans who felt major disruptions to their lives -- personal, household, or community -- were still near pandemic-lows; (2) In January, the majority of school parents were still comfortable with their children attending school -- despite a decrease compared to the previous month; (3) Based on parent reports, the share of students who have had to quarantine from school increased substantially. In November and December, about a quarter of parents said they had a child who had to quarantine. But in January that number jumped to 37 percent. The vast majority of those parents -- 82 percent -- viewed quarantining as disruptive to their child's education; and (4) In January, three out of five school parents supported moving back to remote learning due to the Omicron variant. Democrats, Blacks, urbanities, and younger generations were the most supportive of shifting to remote learning. Republicans and those living in small town/rural areas were least supportive. This report highlights: (1) COVID-19 and schooling; (2) school choice policies; (3) views on K-12 education; and (4) the survey profile and demographics.",

        "description":"In education systems around the world, planners and policymakers are calling for more attention to whole-system improvement. To best address teaching and learning outcomes, teachers and head teachers need whole-system support to build professionalism and improve their practice. The middle tier of education systems, composed of professionals working between the school and central levels, may offer a unique opportunity to facilitate collaboration, broker knowledge, scale innovations, and provide instructional direction to school-level practitioners. This research was conducted as a collaborative partnership between IIEP-UNESCO and Education Development Trust. It explores how middle-tier instructional leaders can form a nexus for improving the quality of education at scale. Through case studies in five jurisdictions--Delhi (India), Jordan, Rwanda, Shanghai (China), and Wales--it explores the professional practices and perceived impacts of instructional leaders and the enabling factors present in the systems where they work. It focuses on promising practices globally, and is designed to draw out insights and lessons for both policy-makers and practitioners.

The research teams in the College Completion Network conducted studies to refine and evaluate interventions for increasing the number of students who earn degrees at open- and broad-access institutions with the goal of providing college leaders and policymakers with reliable evidence on promising strategies. This briefing book presents high-level summaries of the approaches and findings of each network project as well as links to additional resources related to the projects. These projects examined interventions for which there was strong interest at open- and broad-access institutions.

Though several federal funding streams can be used for this purpose, state and district leaders have a great opportunity to leverage COVID-relief funds to expand their diversity efforts. The primary source of these funds, the American Rescue Plan (ARP), provides a one-time federal investment of more than $122 billion that distributes support among the nation's schools to aid in the long-term recovery from COVID-19. Although at least 90% of these dollars flow directly to districts, each state has a minimum set-aside that can be used through early 2025. As a condition for receiving funds--often referred to as Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds--states were required to submit plans outlining how they will use funds for authorized purposes, including &quot;expanding the educator pipeline and educator diversity.&quot; This report is a collection of state-level data on the use of ESSER funds to elevate promising practices for advocates and policymakers. State spending is broken down into three broad categories: (1) Supporting educator preparation programs that attract and support candidates of color; (2) Developing and/or implementing policies or programs to recruit teachers of color; and (3) Developing and/or implementing policies or programs to retain teachers of color.",

        "author":["Maienza, Matteo"],
        "description":"Music therapy has acquired over the years a gradual process of medicalization generated by the need to provide evidence-based results in the treatment and rehabilitation of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Otherwise, the goal of music as therapy should not be to propose music as a kind of remedy or cure, but to promote relationships between individuals, to acquire a collective awareness thanks to the communicative potential of music. Modern approaches can rely on Disability Studies as a ground to move in this direction, in a humanistic perspective, centering on culture, orienting on resources rather than defects and discussing the roles of power in the therapeutic relationship.
