        "description":"This paper describes efforts to increase the prevalence, rigor and relevance of Project Based Learning in US schools and internationally. Under a grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education (FIPSE), US Department of Education, the Buck Institute for Education and partners are offering: 1) an online staff development resource, 2) modules for use in teacher training institutions, 3) a re-usable online 3-credit course, and 4) a way to share projects, collaborate on research, and advance understanding of effective use of projects in the classroom. The PBL-Online web site will offer a multi-pathway, interactive, video rich website designed to prepare pre-service and practicing teachers to implement academically rigorous, standards-focused Project Based Learning (PBL). The online materials are based on the BIE \"Project Based Learning Handbook\" that provides teachers with in-depth, systematic instruction in the planning, implementation and assessment of standards-focused PBL. Our work with the Handbook was recently highlighted as a key resource for proponents of small school reform in an evaluation of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation National School District and Network Grants Program conducted by the American Institutes for Research with SRI International on page 65 of the report (http://smallhs.sri.com). Making this Handbook available online and offering online instruction in its use will support wider use and study of this promising but often either underutilized or misunderstood approach. Appended are: (1) PBL-online Homepage; (2) Modules for Pathway 2: Designing Your Project; (3) Exploration Sections in Each Module; and (4) Links to Website and Supplemental Resources.",

        "description":"In 1998, Congress authorized the School Breakfast Program Pilot Project (SBPP) to study the implementation and effects of providing universal free school breakfast in six school districts across the United States. For three years, from School Year (SY) 2000-2001 through SY 2002-2003, these six school districts received federal funds to offer school breakfasts free of charge, regardless of family income, to students in a number of elementary schools that were matched on a number of characteristics, then randomly assigned to either treatment or control status. The control schools continued to offer the regular School Breakfast Program (SBP), which provides free or reduced-price breakfasts to eligible students from low-income families. Over the course of the three years of the pilot project, data were collected from all participating schools for an evaluation of the implementation and impact of providing universal-free school breakfast. The current report serves as the final report of findings from the SBPP. It provides impact estimates for a smaller set of outcomes, based on data collected over the remaining two years of the pilot, and integrates the findings from all three years of the SBPP. This report also presents findings from an additional set of analyses undertaken to address a set of questions that have been raised by policy makers and other stakeholders since the release of the first year report. These include analyses  focused on students who do not eat breakfast (\"breakfast skippers\") and those who eat a nutritionally robust or \"substantive breakfast\"; variations in the breakfast setting (i.e., school versus home, classroom versus other school location); characteristics of students in food insecure households; and differences in student outcomes by household income level. The remaining sections of this chapter provide background information about the SBP; a brief summary of research on the relationship between breakfast and student outcomes; an overview of the SBPP, including a review of the conceptual model for understanding the pilot project; a summary of the findings in the interim report on Year 1 findings, and a description of the purpose and contents of  this final report.",

        "description":"Utah's Alternate Assessment (UAA) is one of six components of the Utah Performance  Assessment System for Students (U-PASS). UAA is designed to assess the achievement of students in grades 1 through 12 with significant cognitive disabilities. It was developed to fulfill two main purposes: (1) To address federal legislative mandates that all students participate in statewide testing in the areas of language arts and math; and (2) To provide valid information that can be used to improve educational outcomes for students with significant cognitive disabilities in Utah's public schools. In order to provide the most valid possible information about student outcomes, UAA includes: (1) Direct observations of student performances; (2) Standardized assessment tasks that are selected based on individual students' needs; (3) Standardized administration procedures that are embedded in naturally occurring routines in natural settings; and (4) Standardized scoring criteria that reflect both mastery and generalization. Any assessment for students with significant cognitive disabilities must address the tension between two demands: individualization and standardization. The population of students who will participate in alternate assessment is highly diverse; it includes students from 1st through 12th grade who have a wide variety of learning needs and whose Individualized Education Programs may be addressing very different skills. This diversity must be recognized in any valid assessment of achievement outcomes for this group of students. So, while the domains of language arts and math must be addressed for all students, the particular skills targeted and how they are tested must be  individualized in order to obtain meaningful results for each student. However, in order  to make meaningful comparisons, assessment tasks and administration procedures must  be standardized. UAA balances these two demands by providing a set of assessment tasks with standardized administration procedures and performance criteria, from which the teacher chooses assessment targets for individual students. This system is designed to provide valid annual assessment of important outcomes for students with significant  cognitive disabilities. It is also important to remember that the alternate assessment is just one piece of the overall assessment system and its primary purpose is accountability of the educational system. Thus, in order to best address how well the system is supporting positive educational outcomes for students with significant cognitive disabilities, UAA focuses on the individual student's independent performance of important skills embedded in naturally occurring routines in natural settings. An index to Language Arts Tasks and an index to Math Tasks are included at the end of this report.",

        "description":"There is concern that low-income children might be coming to school without eating breakfast and still not be participating in the School Breakfast Program (SBP) for a variety of reasons, including a perceived stigma associating school breakfast participation with poverty. One approach to increasing participation in the SBP is to offer free breakfast to all students, regardless of their household income. However, such a universal-free approach to increasing breakfast participation would substantially increase the cost to the federal government. Thus it is critical to know if such expenditures are warranted. Specifically, would the increase in SBP participation by students in elementary schools offering universal-free school breakfast result in improved dietary intakes and/or measures of academic performance? In this context, Congress enacted Section 109 of the William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-336), authorizing the implementation and the evaluation of a three-year pilot in elementary schools in six school districts representing a range of economic and demographic characteristics. The two main objectives of the evaluation were to: (1) Assess the effects of the availability of universal-free school breakfast on breakfast participation and selected student outcome measures including dietary intake, cognitive and social/emotional functioning, academic achievement, school attendance, tardiness, classroom behavior and discipline, food insecurity, and health; and (2) Document the methods used by schools to implement universal-free school breakfast and determine the effect of participation in this program on administrative requirements and costs. What these findings suggest is that simply offering free school breakfast to all elementary school students would not, on average, be expected to improve academic or behavior outcomes beyond what occurs in schools already offering the SBP.

        "description":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) sponsored the NSLP Application/Verification Pilot Projects to test ways to improve the process for certifying students for free or reduced-price meals. This report presents findings on the impacts of two alternatives to the current application based certification process--Up-Front Documentation and Graduated Verification--that were tested in 12 public school districts. It examines the impacts of pilot procedures on three key sets of measures of program performance: (1) The rate of certification among ineligible households; (2) The rate of certification among eligible households; and (3) Certification accuracy--the proportion of certifications that are correct. In launching the pilots, USDA was seeking to identify changes to the certification process that would deter certification among ineligible households without causing barriers to certification among eligible households. The end goal was an overall improvement in certification accuracy as compared to the accuracy achieved with current certification procedures. Each pilot procedure was evaluated in terms of these measures. The study used a comparison design to select additional districts not participating in the three-year pilots but with similar economic characteristics and geographic locations. Researchers then compared the two types of districts to estimate impacts on the accuracy of the certification process, as well as to what degree it deterred ineligible families or discouraged eligible families from applying. Data for the study came from telephone and in-person interviews with about 3,000 households with children enrolled in the study districts in fall 2002, and from administrative records provided by the schools. Key findings were: (1) The rates of erroneous certification among ineligible students were less than 5 percent in Up- Front Documentation comparison districts and less than 10 percent in Graduated Verification comparison districts. (2) Rates of certification among each group of eligible students examined were lower in pilot districts than in comparisons districts. (3) Compared to current procedures, neither set of pilot procedures changed certification accuracy at a level that could be detected in the study. Contains 25 tables.",

The Team is comprised of members from the law enforcement, emergency  management, health, and education organizations who have worked throughout the  year to update school and emergency service resources. The School Safety Review Checklist is intended to be used in conjunction with the School Crisis Procedures Guide, which can be accessed from the Vermont Department of Education Web site. School leaders can improve school safety and help reduce the risk to students and staff by annually conducting buildings and grounds safety review and correcting any  deficiencies that are identified. It is understood that this document needs to be tailored to the varying needs and size of Vermont schools. Therefore, this department encourages taking advantage of the electronic format and revise the Safety Checklist to meet your particular circumstances.",

        "description":"This report, the fifth in a serious of reports about the evaluation of the National School Lunch Program focuses on issues relating to applications for free or reduced-price meals. In particular, it presents (1) an impact analysis of the effects of the pilot policies on the number of applications submitted, and (2) a descriptive analysis of the accuracy of eligibility status determinations made by the School Food Authorities (SFAs). The analyses address these main research questions: (1) How did the UFD and GV pilot interventions affect the percentage of students who applied for free or reduced-price meal benefits? In households that were income eligible for benefits but did not apply for them, what reasons did parents give for not applying? (2) Were the SFAs' determinations of eligibility status consistent with those calculated using data that households supplied in interviews conducted for the evaluation? (3) Are differences due to administrative errors (disagreement between SFAs' determinations and eligibility status calculated by MPR from the information provided on the application and associated documentation) or reporting differences (inconsistencies between information reported on surveys and that provided with the applications)? (4) What are the specific reasons for these two types of discrepancies? Contains 21 Tables, 1 figure, and 3 charts. Appended are: (1) Supplemental Tables for Chapter II;  (2) Supplemental Tables for Chapter III;  (3) Supplemental Tables for Chapter IV; (4) Supplemental Tables for Chapter V; and (5) Household Characteristics Associated with Differences between SFA Decision.",

(1) Support high-quality, innovative instruction to improve student achievement; (2) Provide and promote high-quality educational leadership; (3) Promote safe and positive learning environments; (4) Build department capacity to best support external needs; and (5) Practice and promote effective use of all resources. The Strategic Plan includes objectives and strategies that support each goal. Some of these are the responsibility of the commissioner and the department; others are the responsibility of the Board. During its June 2004 retreat, the Board reviewed all of the strategies and selected the following six to be included in its work plan for the 2004-05 fiscal year. The prefix designations (e.g. I.A.4.) refer to the goal, objective and strategy designations that appear in the Strategic Plan (e.g. Goal I, Objective A, Strategy 4). Each objective has indicators, which are measurable results that reflect the success of the objective. Several of the indicators are percentages, and therefore are expected to increase (5) or decrease (6) as a desired result. 2004-2005 Focus Strategies are bold in the document.",

Several questions were asked of interviewees in all three phases of this project: (1) Which HIV prevention interventions do you provide to youth? (2) Which HIV risks do you address with youth? (3) What resources would you need to improve HIV education; and (4) Are there any (e.g., not related to HIV) services lacking for the youth you serve? The phone interviews for each phase were modified to fit the settings in which the interviewees were working with youth. Because the interviewees in Phases II and III were working in educational settings, the interviews used in those phases were quite similar. The interview for Phase I, however, differed more significantly from the other two, because it was geared toward a wide variety of service providers, some of whom might not provide HIV education of any sort to the out-of-school youth with whom they were working. This project summary focuses on those content areas that are similar across all three projects, in order to have an overview regarding how 13- to 24-year-olds in Vermont are being provided with HIV education and prevention.",

        "description":"The study investigates what practitioners are doing to create effective middle schools for Latino students (the Latino student population in seven of the nine schools was more than 90 percent). The study includes a literature review that places itself within the larger context of research literature. The study?s research findings are organized into six areas that encompass the 57 characteristics of effective schools identified by the study's authors: school leadership, teacher expertise and relationships, Latino culture and second language issues, organizational structure, curriculum and instruction, and community and parent involvement. This research brief describes the study's findings in each of the six areas and indicates how the success of these schools can be replicated. In addition, the authors identify a seventh area that is arguably more difficult to replicate: coherence. The challenges to the approaches suggested  in this study of the characteristics of middle schools in which poor and Latino students  make substantial achievement gains are many. From classrooms to the resources necessary to create the nurturing environments in middle schools, it is plain that there are no easy solutions.

Far less understood, however, are the negative social and economic consequences that U.S. residents are likely to experience if current population shifts and disparities in educational levels continue over the next two decades. The fact that significant numbers of minority populations are concentrated in a small number of states and often in urban areas--highlights the importance of a few key geographic areas addressing higher education inequality among specific racial/ethnic groups. However, because many smaller states have relatively high proportions of minorities, the ability of all states to address the educational needs of their minority populations is critical for creating a better-educated workforce, increasing the earning power of their residents, and remaining competitive with other states and countries. Education is one of the most effective interventions for improving social and economic future--for individuals, communities, states, and the country as a whole. Given the changing nature of the global marketplace, the high school diploma is no longer sufficient for individuals seeking good jobs, nor for communities building a vibrant economy. Addressing inequalities in higher education opportunity will require persistent and meaningful efforts by states in order to put in place the policies and resources to advance the education of all their residents.

These are known as the Achievement Model and the growth Model respectively. The legislation also established an intensive assistance program for schools not meeting the accreditation standards. In the new accreditation model, accountability continues to be a major focus, and all components of a school, including students, teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members, are held accountable for student learning.

This report focuses attention on the knowledge and skills in English that recently have been identified as important for success beyond high school. The report examines whether state and national standards for high school students identify the content that two recent reports (Conley, 2003, & American Diploma Project, 2004) argue is necessary for students to be successful in post-secondary work or education. Based on the expectations outlined in these reports, McREL analysts compared national and highly rated state documents that describe what students should know and be able to do by the end of 12th grade against documents that describe the knowledge and skills that incoming college students should acquire to be successful in their first year of college.",

The purposes of the study were: (1) to examine the effects of online professional development on teacher professional community and teacher retention, (2) to evaluate the influences of the RTI on teacher instruction, teacher and administrator use of technology, and administrator practice, and (3) to identify those aspects of the RTI intervention that worked best and those that should be changed. From a pool of 22 schools, McREL researchers chose seven pairs to participate in the study, based on the extent to which their rural status, demographic characteristics, and technology environments matched. Within each pair, schools were randomly assigned to the RTI treatment group or to the no-treatment control group. The study sample included 126 teachers and 14 administrators from six treatment schools (one school withdrew from the study) in four states, and 136 teachers and 17 administrators from seven control schools in three states. Data were collected through teacher and administrator surveys administered before and after the RTI, an administrator interview and survey, and two focus groups. In addition, two of the online threaded discussions were analyzed for content. The data indicated that the RTI was implemented as planned with relatively few technological difficulties. However, teacher participation in RTI activities varied considerably, with those who participated more perceiving more impact on their instruction and their students' learning. The following are appended: (1) Survey Items and Scales; and (2) Supplementary Tables and Graphs.",

Reports in the series provide information about how benchmarks might best appear in a sequence of instruction and include information on how that content is organized within the state standards documents analyzed. This report is intended to to inform and guide state or district curriculum directors or others who, starting from content that is placed within broad grade bands, need to assign specific grades to benchmarks or objectives. The purpose of this study is to determine what instructional sequences might be revealed through an analysis of standards documents in the subject areas of geography and history. In order to compare geography and history content across the state documents, each of which varies somewhat in the content described, a uniform set of benchmarks was required for reference. To create this reference point, the authors of the study turned to an earlier McREL study on common content in geography and history. This collection of content sequenced by topic should prove useful for districts and schools seeking to assign their states grade-range content to specific grades for instruction.",

This emphasis grows out of the research showing that teachers' mastery of the academic content they teach is critical to engaging students and is a significant factor in raising levels of student achievement. Newly hired and veteran teachers must satisfy the definition of a Highly Qualified Teacher. Veteran teachers must be HQT by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. Federal regulations require that new and newly hired teachers be highly qualified at the time of hire. This packet contains the forms principals need to complete the HQT requirement. New teachers, new teachers to the building or teachers with new assignments shall complete Forms A-E. Veteran teachers in the same building will receive a status sheet. The form(s) will be used to determine whether the teacher satisfies the definition of a Highly Qualified Teacher based on the federal criteria.

        "description":"This booklet was developed to help school staff members, parents, and community leaders understand how family centers can promote family participation and strengthen their schools. It also serves as a guide to establishing family centers. The term, family center, is used throughout this booklet, although many schools prefer to call their center another name. Whatever its name, a successful family center allows families to feel a sense of ownership in the school; to feel like insiders. The family center permits school staff members and families to establish relationships, programs, and activities to help children succeed academically, emotionally, and socially. To achieve that success, parents and other community members interested in the school must help create the center. The term, parent, refers to any caregiver who assumes responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. How a school family center is started and run reveals a great deal about the school's overall relationship with families and the community in promoting student learning. Schools with an effective program of parent involvement welcome parents and other family members as decision makers, collaborators, volunteers, communicators, instructors, and advocates in their children's learning. Appended are: (1) Web Resources for School Family Centers; (2) Schools that Say, \"Welcome!\"; (3) Ten Things Parents Want School Staff to Know; (4) DPI Policy on Family-School-Community Partnerships; and (5) Measuring Your Family-School-Community Partnerships.",

        "description":"This paper examines how controlling statistically for baseline covariates (especially pretests) improves the precision of studies that randomize schools to measure the impacts of educational interventions on student achievement. Part I of the paper introduces the concepts, issues, and options involved. Parts II and III present empirical findings that illustrate how precision is influenced by a wide range of different covariates. These findings were based on multiple years of individual data for student test scores in reading and math from five urban school districts. They represent grades three and five for elementary schools, grade eight for middle schools, and grade ten for high schools. Part IV of the paper compares its results to those of previous research, presents an approach for quantifying uncertainty about its results, and considers what further research is needed. Findings indicate that: (1) pretests can reduce the number of randomized schools required for a given level of precision to about one-half of what would be needed otherwise for elementary schools, one-fifth for middle schools, and one-tenth for high schools; (2) aggregate school-level pretests are as effective in this regard as are individual student-level pretests; (3) the precision-enhancing power of pretests declines somewhat, but not much, as the number of years between the pretest and post-tests increases; (4) the precision enhancing power of pretests for multiple baseline years is only slightly greater than that for a single baseline year; and (5) the precision-enhancing power of pretests is substantial, even when the pretest differs from the post-test.

To address this issue, McREL decided to create and test a comprehensive, research-based model of professional development that helps teachers integrate technology into their classroom instruction, and ultimately, helps students achieve challenging content standards. The research behind MTI has now developed into a model of professional development known as the McREL Technology Solutions (MTS) program. To develop this program, McREL conducted a comprehensive review of the relevant literature on education technology, professional development, and the use of technology to support learning, and then designed a research-based intervention. The intervention was pilot-tested and subsequently modified in view of the findings. McREL then conducted a field test of the modified intervention using a matched comparison design. The field test has generated data regarding the effectiveness of the research-based MTS model. Appended are: (1) Review of Literature of the Use of Technology in the Classroom; (2) MTI Logic Model; (3) Teacher Technology Survey; (4) Administrator Technology Profile; (5) MTS Training Module Development; (6) Description of Pilot Sites; (7) Memorandum of Understanding; (8) Technology Integration Readiness Survey; (9) MTS Lesson Planning Guide; (10) MTS Reflective Dialog Protocol; and (11) MTS Reflective Dialog Protocol Guiding Questions.",

The goals for the current research synthesis are: (1) To identify a comprehensive collection of studies on standards-based education, gathered through a structured search process and screened for relevance and research quality; (2) To describe and analyze these studies through a systematic review that examines teacher and student outcomes in relation to the variables of standards-based curriculum, standards-based instructional guidelines, and standards-based assessment; and (3) To describe the implications of study findings for researchers, education administrators, and policymakers. This synthesis is organized into six chapters. Chapter 1 describes the research problem and conceptual framework, provides background information on standards-based education, and discusses prior research. Chapter 2 describes the methods used to search the literature, code the studies, and synthesize results. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 review research on the influences of standards-based curriculum, standards-based instructional guidelines, and standards-based assessment, respectively. Chapter 6 summarizes the findings across the studies of the three variables and provides general conclusions. Appendices include additional details on the literature searches, the instrument used to code the studies, and tables of the reviewed studies. The tables describe in detail the characteristics, methods, and findings of the studies and serve as an annotated bibliography.

The child support program is the first line of defense against poverty and public assistance costs. It is unique among other children's programs because the benefit to children is paid by their non-custodial parents, not the public. It is a cost-effective, successful government program that helps millions of working single parent families. The child support program works in large part because program funding has increased at both federal and state levels. However, state investment has increased more rapidly than federal funding. In the decade since 1994, states and counties have increased their state only dollars in the program by 140 percent, while the federal government increased its funding by 48 percent. The child support program helps families become self-sufficient, promotes parental responsibility, keeps fathers connected to their children, and avoids federal public assistance costs--consistent with bipartisan values often expressed in Congress.",

        "description":"The U.S. House of Representatives is considering budget reconciliation legislation that would decrease federally funded foster care services by $577 million over five years and $1.3 billion over ten years. The budget legislation is expected to go to the House floor on Thursday, November 10, 2005. The provisions in the House budget bill would discourage states from placing abused and neglected children with grandparents and other relatives, impede state efforts to reunify children with their parents, and make it more difficult to provide critical services to children and families. The House budget provisions would, among other things: (1) Eliminate federally funded foster care assistance for at least 4,000 children who live in low-income homes with their grandparents or other relatives; (2) Place time limitations on federal matching funds for costs to serve children in safe but unlicensed relative placements, and other limitations on child placement and administrative funds. Many thousands of foster children will be hurt by the proposed cuts, with children of color being disproportionately affected. Together, the foster care provisions in the House budget legislation would cut foster care funding to states by nearly $577 million over five years and $1.3 billion over ten years. Most of this money will come from reducing support to relatives who care for abused children who would otherwise end up in unrelated foster homes. States will be left scrambling to find money in their budgets to support relative placements, often the best home for children. Without funding for relative placements, children are more likely to be unnecessarily placed with strangers, reducing their chances of long-term stability and positive child outcomes.",

        "description":"On October 26, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a budget reconciliation bill that includes provisions to reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. This bill provides only $500 million in new child care funding over five years, despite estimates by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) staff that keeping pace with inflation will cost $4.8 billion over five years. In addition, the bill significantly increases work requirements for families receiving public assistance, making the need for child care even greater. This level of funding, if enacted, would force states to cut child care assistance for low-income working families over the coming years. Congress must provide new funds for child care to both keep pace with inflation and meet the cost of reasonable work requirements. Low-income working families are struggling every day to make ends meet, to keep their jobs, and to ensure that their children are safe. The Senate has taken a moderate, balanced approach; in contrast, the House bill abandons the very families that most need help and will cause hundreds of thousands of children to lose the child care help their families need to work and succeed. The House Committee is urged to reconsider this legislation and to make significant new investments in child care for low-income families.",

In fiscal year 2004, about $14 billion in grants and $56 billion in loans were made under title IV while estimated outlay equivalents for postsecondary tax preferences amounted to $10 billion. In light of the relative newness and financial significance of tax preferences, this report examines (1) how title IV assistance compares to that provided through the tax code, (2) the extent to which tax filers effectively use postsecondary tax preferences, and (3) what is known about the effectiveness of federal assistance.

        "description":"This issue of &quot;NECTAC Notes&quot; concludes that states have exhibited a strong interest in using the option of a developmental delay eligibility category for young children served by IDEA. Future changes in state eligibility policies may reflect several provisions related to eligibility policies and practices that are contained in the regulations. These provisions require that: a variety of assessment tools and strategies, including information from parents, be used to gather relevant functional and developmental information to assist in determining eligibility (see 34 C.F.R. Section 300.532-Evaluation procedures); a team of qualified professionals and the parent(s) of the child be involved in the eligibility decision (see 34 C.F.R. Section 300.534-Determination of eligibility); and the IEP team for each eligible child include the parents of the child (see 34 C.F.R. Section 300.344-IEP team). Topics covered in this issue include: (1) Findings; (2) Disability Terminology Used for Young Children; (3) Age Ranges Used by States for Developmental Delay; (4) Relationship between Developmental Delay and Other Part B Categories; and (5) Eligibility Criteria for Developmental Delay.

Congress stated that there was a need to &quot;enhance the capability of state and local agencies and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs of historically underrepresented populations, particularly minority, low-income, inner city and rural populations.&quot; The 1986 reauthorization of the law had created the Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Program and state interagency coordinating councils (ICCs) as one of the required components. The law mandated that at least 20 percent of the members of these councils be parents of children with disabilities. State ICCs strove to meet the need to enhance services to under-served groups within their locales by encouraging the participation by diverse citizens on the councils and committees. This document describes several ways ICCs can encourage and expand diverse parent representation on councils and committees. Although it specifically concerns parent members, this paper can also be useful for general recruitment of diverse members.",

Under Part C, participating states and jurisdictions must provide services to two groups of children: those who are experiencing developmental delays, and those who have a diagnosed mental or physical condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay. In addition, states may choose to serve children who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided.

        "description":"Using achievement tests to hold students and schools accountable seems an obvious idea. Students come to school to learn. Tests show which students, in which schools, are meeting learning standards and which are not. Those students and schools that are falling short should be held accountable. Of course, the rationales for accountability testing programs are much more complex than that, as are testing's effects, both intended and unintended. This chapter, describes various rationales for accountability testing programs over the past century. This history forms the backdrop for current test-driven reforms, including Public Law 107-110, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), which was signed into law in January 2002. The goals are first, to illustrate the diversity of mechanisms whereby testing may affect educational practice and learning outcomes; and second, to show that while many of the same ideas have recurred over time in different forms and guises, accountability testing has become more sophisticated. One constant in this changing picture has been the idea that education should produce measurable results. Again and again, policymakers have advanced accountability testing as a means for improving education, each generation responding to the failings of the previous. It remains to be seen how effective today's accountability testing will prove to be in supporting genuine, comprehensive educational reform.",

This report explains the relationship between alignment and score inflation by clarifying what is meant by inappropriate test preparation. It provides a concrete, hypothetical example that illustrates a process by which scores become inflated and follows this with more complete discussion of the mechanisms of score inflation and their link to teachers' responses to high-stakes testing. Policymakers embarking on an effort to create a more effective system less prone to the drawbacks of simple test-based accountability cannot rely solely on alignment and should consider several additional steps: redesigning external tests in other ways to minimize inflation, setting attainable performance targets, relying on multiple measures, and reestablishing a role for professional judgment. Developing more effective alternatives will take us beyond what is well established and will require innovation, experimentation, and rigorous evaluation.",

        "description":"This paper addresses accountability and the role emerging technologies can play in improving education. The connection between accountability and technology can be best summarized in one term: feedback. Technological supports provide ways of designing, collecting and sharing information in order to provide the basis for the improvement of systems and outcomes. Because technological options are so varied and the future of their development unpredictable, the paper argues that the first screen for the review of technology is one addressing core functions that technology serves. Technologies can provide greater efficiency in managing information or serve to improve the quality of the information used to guide the system. At this point, these functions are frequently mutually exclusive, but in the future, wise selection of technology should involve a consideration of how the technology adds value by increasing quality and efficiency in the enterprise. Quality is added when more knowledge is available to the user. For choices that need to be made about investments, a set of criteria is provided to guide decision logic. Criteria include validity, accuracy, and utility, with an emphasis on users directly involved in learning (students and teachers). In addition, criteria are reviewed related to software/hardware operation, including security, backup, compatibility, resilience, and transparency. The assumption is that systematic application of criteria will influence the market to drive development of more useful systems for education at a cost that can be withstood. Throughout, examples of technology uses now and soon to be available are discussed. The paper concludes with two extended educational scenarios constructed to show elements of design and technology in practice in two very different settings.",

Findings from the Year 4 evaluation are presented next; the report concludes with recommendations and refinements for future years of MSA. Years 1, 2, and 3 of the UCLA/CRESST evaluation of the MSA project were designed to describe how the program was implemented, to assess program effects and to generate recommendations for the improvement and enhancement of the project. Year 4 of the MSA evaluation paralleled the same research questions as Years 1 - 3 of the project, and was expanded to include a number of different features designed to further strengthen the project and gauge project impact as MSA expanded to elementary schools. The following research issues were examined: (1) How did the MSA program evolve? (2) What was the effect of MSA on teaching and learning? (3) How can the program be refined and sustained? (4) How can the program to be refined to better support and enhance teacher professional development, administrative leadership, and student learning and achievement? (Contains 17 tables.)",

This report presents a fully Bayesian approach to estimating three-level hierarchical models in which latent variable regression coefficients capturing the relationship between initial status and rates of change within each of \"J\" schools (Bw[sub]j, j = 1..., J) are treated as varying across schools. Through analyses of data from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth, show how modeling differences in Bw[sub]j as a function of school characteristics can broaden the kinds of questions we can address in school effects research. The possibility of conducting sensitivity analyses employing \"t\" distributional assumptions at each level of such models (termed LVR-HM3s) is illustrated, and presented results from a simulation study that focuses on the coverage properties of marginal posterior intervals for fixed effects in LVR-HM3s. The article outlines extensions of LVR-HM3s to settings in which growth is nonlinear, and discusses the use of LVR-HM3s in other types of research including multisite evaluation studies in which time-series data are collected during a pre-intervention period, and cross-sectional studies in which within-cluster latent variable regression slopes are treated as varying across clusters.",

        "description":"Educators worry that high-stakes testing will induce teachers and their students to focus only on the test and ignore other, untested aspects of knowledge. Some counter that although this may be true, knowing something is better than knowing nothing and many students would benefit even by learning the material that is to be tested. Using the metaphor of deterring drivers from speeding, it is shown that the optimal rules for high-stakes testing depend on the costs of learning and of monitoring. For high cost learners, and when monitoring technology is inefficient, it is better to announce what will be tested. For efficient learners, de-emphasizing the test itself is the right strategy. This is analogous to telling drivers where the police are posted when police are few. At least there will be no speeding on those roads. When police are abundant or when the fine is high relative to the benefit from speeding, it is better to keep police locations secret, which results in obeying the law everywhere. Children who are high cost learners are less likely to learn all the material and therefore learn more when they are told what is on the exam. The same logic also implies that tests should be clearly defined for younger children, but more amorphous for more advanced students.",

Many computer systems are outdated and inadequate, and schools and districts often lack appropriate userfriendly software for data analysis (Bernhardt 2004; Wayman, Stringfield, & Yakimowski, 2004). Furthermore, educators frequently lack the skills of to make effective use of data (Baker, 2003; Choppin, 2002; Cizek, 2000; Cromey, 2000). To address these problems, for the past three years work at the National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Testing CRESST at UCLA has focused on the following objectives: (1) Design and develop a decision support tool, the web-based Quality School Portfolio (QSP) version 4.0; (2) Develop a standardized training system for trainers and end users with certification for trainers; (3) Implement a national rollout of QSP with multiple approaches to training and support; (4) Conduct evaluation research to evaluate the effectiveness of the features and functions of QSP, the effectiveness of the training, and the benefits of QSP use on educational improvement; and (5) Design requirements for the 5th generation of decision-support tools using results from the foregoing objectives. This report covers work related to these objectives over a three year period. Contains 33 figures (some color enhanced), and 12 Tables.

This study explores the potential usefulness of adapting differential item functioning (DIF) techniques for this purpose. It distinguishes between reactive and nonreactive changes in DIF over time and relates these to the framework for validating scores under high-stakes conditions offered by Koretz, McCaffrey, and Hamilton (2001). It contrasts score-anchored and item-anchored approaches to DIF in terms of their potential for this purpose. It explored changes in the distribution of DIF in the NAEP eighth-grade mathematics assessment between 1990 and 2000 in five low-gain and five high-gain states, in each case treating all other participating states as the reference group. It used the score-anchored method of DIF analysis implemented in BILOG-MG (Bock & Zimowski, 2003b), which allows only item difficulties to vary across groups. This exploration indicated that the approach has potential but confronts several substantial difficulties. Further exploration using data from high-stakes testing programs is recommended.",

It presents the most recent data available for children under the age of 6, taken from the 2001 administration of the ECPP. Interviews were conducted with parents or guardians of 6,741 children under age 6 who were not yet enrolled in kindergarten. The overall response rate for the ECPP parent interview was 59.9 percent. When weighted to reflect national totals, these data represent the child care and early educational experiences of approximately 20.3 million children under the age of 6 who are not yet enrolled in kindergarten or higher grades. This report also looks at the characteristics associated with participation in three specific types of nonparental care: relative, nonrelative, and center-based care. In addition, this report examines the out-of-pocket expenses for nonparental care paid by families who had care arrangements and whose parents reported that they paid something for care. In sum, findings from this report using the most recent data available from the NHES support previous research showing that children's participation in nonparental care and education arrangements is related to a variety of factors. Children of different ages and racial or ethnic backgrounds, in different economic situations, with mothers of varying educational levels and employment statuses, and who live in different areas of the country exhibit differences with respect to whether or not they have any weekly child care arrangements. Their families also report differences in the location and providers of child care. Additionally, the time children spend in nonparental care, and the amount their families pay for it, are related to many of the same factors associated with participation in nonparental care and education, including those which are unique to this report, poverty status and geographic region.

With the deadline approaching for all teachers to meet the requirements, GAO was asked to examine the following: (1) the status of state efforts to meet NCLBA's teacher qualification requirements; (2) the use of Title II funds in selected districts; and (3) how the U.S. Department of Education (Education) monitors states and assists them with implementation of the requirements. To help states address the issues of teacher quality and ensure that all teachers meet NCLBA's qualification requirements, the GAO  recommends that the Secretary of Education explore ways to make the Web-based information on teacher qualification requirements more accessible to users of its Web site through such activities as more prominently displaying the link to state teacher initiatives or enhancing the capability of the search function.

        "description":"This analysis describes and analyzes disproportionality among Indiana's minority students. Specifically, it shows that: (1) Indiana's two largest minority groups are overrepresented in all four locale designations, with the greatest disproportionality occurring in suburban schools for both out-of-school suspension and expulsion; (2) Disproportionality is the greatest for both minority groups in the disciplinary categories of Disruptive Behavior and Other for out-of-school suspension and expulsion; (3) The highest rates of out-of-school suspension occur at the secondary school level for all racial categories; (4) Disproportionality in out-of-school suspension is the highest in elementary schools for African Americans and in high schools for Hispanics; (5) The rate of, and disproportionality in expulsion for both African Americans and Hispanics is the highest at the high school level; and (6) The relationship between disciplinary use and achievement holds for racial groups independently, and is strongest for African Americans. The finding that two of Indiana's minority groups are more likely to be suspended out of school and expelled at higher rates in urban, suburban, town, and rural schools is consistent with previous research in the area of racial disparities in school discipline. The fact that the greatest disproportionality by locale is within suburban schools is noteworthy. While previous analyses found the highest overall out-of-school suspension rate was in urban schools, the results of this analysis suggest that racial differences in use are the greatest in suburban areas, especially for African Americans. Since suburban schools have among the lowest rates of students who qualify for free and reduced lunch, these results cast doubt on the notion that disproportionality in the administration of school discipline is primarily due to poverty.

        "description":"Since the 1980's, fear of school violence has driven American public education toward  increasingly punitive and exclusionary methods of school discipline. Yet recent research has begun to raise serious questions about the effectiveness and equity of suspension and expulsion. Despite such controversy concerning the use and effectiveness of suspension and expulsion, little is known about the actual perspectives of school principals; that is, to what extent do instructional leaders support the philosophy of zero tolerance in general, or the use of suspension and expulsion in particular? Previous research has suggested that there are distinctly different perspectives among principals towards school discipline and that these attitudes may be associated with differences in the use of suspension and expulsion. To address such questions, the authors surveyed Indiana's principals on their perspectives concerning school discipline and violence prevention strategies. Their goals were to (1) gain a sense of attitudes of principals towards school discipline; and (2) explore the extent to which principal attitudes and perspectives are related to disciplinary outcomes in Indiana's schools.

        "description":"Previous research has suggested that increased use of school suspension and expulsion  may be associated with increased risk of dropout and lower achievement. Part of the  purpose of school discipline is to maintain school climates conducive to learning. This  paper describes analyses exploring the relationship between school use of out of-  school suspension and achievement outcomes in one Midwestern state. A combination of factors, including poverty, race, and school rate of out-of-school suspension are able to significantly predict school passing rates on Indiana State Test of Educational Progress (ISTEP). Thus, regardless of demographic factors, schools with a higher rate of out-of-school suspension have lower percentages of students who pass ISTEP. Moreover, by examining these factors simultaneously, it is clear that lower passing rates for African American students are not solely due to the effect of poverty, but that race makes a contribution of its own to average passing ISTEP scores. The increasing influence of race from elementary to secondary school analyses is similar to previous research in this area, and suggests an increasing contribution of schooling over time to the black-white test score gap.

Beyond the schoolhouse doors, however, removing students from the opportunity for an education also creates a host of negative effects for the community. Emerging findings from the study of what has come to be called the school-to-prison pipeline have found that the increasing tendency to criminalize school behavior is associated with increased school dropout, higher levels of incarceration, and minority overrepresentation in juvenile detention. The findings of this project suggest that there can be a different way. National reports have identified a variety of proactive strategies, resources, and interventions that can reduce the threat of school violence and improve student outcomes. Here in Indiana, innovative programs described by principals and Youth Service Bureaus suggest that schools can maintain orderly environments with high expectations, while at the same time making an active commitment to the continuing education of all children. Together these results show that it is possible to maintain a safe and productive school climate without removing a large number of students from the opportunity to learn. (Contains 4 endnotes.)",

        "description":"By most accounts, the method used to determine the allocation of tuition support to public schools in Indiana is a complex endeavor understood by few. Governor Mitch Daniels and policymakers are publicly calling for a simplified funding process that provides transparent goals that Hoosier citizens can fully comprehend. As state leaders embark on this challenging policy discussion, a common level of understanding is necessary and many key questions must be addressed in the process, including: (1) How does the school funding formula presently work to fund schools? (2) What are the revenue sources for schools and how are these revenues expended? (3) What are the objectives of the formula and are those goals being met? and (4) What are the issues that must be addressed during the 2005 session of the Indiana General Assembly concerning the formula to maximize funding efficiencies? To help demystify the complexities of the school funding formula in Indiana, this policy brief will address these questions and issues head-on. Contents of this issue include: (1) The Shaping of Public School Finance in Indiana; (2) Indiana's Foundation Program: How It Works Today; (3) Adequate Funding for All Schools (Pat Pritchett); (4) Indiana's School Funding Formula: A Need to Get Funding to the Child (Luke Kenley); (5) Indiana's Foundation Program: Has It Achieved Its Goals?; and (6) Expanding the Knowledge Base.

        "description":"How can schools be kept safe and promote a school climate that is conducive to student learning? The previous two papers, examined methods that have not demonstrated success in maintaining safe and productive school climates. The first briefing paper demonstrated that zero tolerance has not met its goal of maintaining safety, has been inconsistently applied, increased racial disparities, and been associated with increased school dropout. The second briefing paper showed that although Indiana's rate of expulsion appears to be declining, the risks associated with the use of school suspension and expulsion appear to apply in Indiana as well. Minority students are over-represented in the use of both suspension and expulsion, and schools with higher rates of out-of-school suspensions tend to have lower passing rates on ISTEP. Are there alternatives? Evidence-based research and panels say yes, and both have identified programs that are clearly effective in reducing the threat of violence. Just as importantly, however, are the effective programs and strategies currently being implemented in Indiana's schools. This paper, describes interviews with principals who are using comprehensive and preventive approaches for promoting a safe and productive school climate without reducing their students' opportunity to learn.

        "description":"Data from the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights showing that Indiana  ranked first in the nation in expulsion and ninth in the nation in expulsions in the most recent available statistics cannot help but raise questions concerning why this is so. At a preliminary presentation of that data before the Indiana State Legislature in the Spring, 2004 session, some respondents suggested that Indiana's relatively high rate of expulsion may be a function of how expulsion is defined. The argument was made that, since Indiana defines an expulsion as any school removal over 10 days, by definition the state would count more school removals as expulsions than other states that may define a higher number of days (e.g., 15 or 20 days) as the dividing line between what is counted as a suspension or an expulsion. Thus Indiana's apparently high rate of expulsion, the argument continued, was simply a function of how the state counts expulsions relative to other states. This is indeed one of many possible hypotheses concerning factors in state statute that might be associated with higher rates of school expulsion. One might, for example, argue that other characteristics of state definition--the presence of zero tolerance policies (not present in Indiana's definition), or relatively broader definitions of infractions subject to expulsion (which Indiana does have)--might be the most important factors in determining a state's rate of expulsion. Only an empirical study of the relationship of such characteristics and state rates of expulsion could adequately test such hypotheses. In order a range of possible reasons for Indiana's rate of expulsion, the authors examined and coded state definitions of expulsion in all 50 states. To find all statutory language related to out-of-school suspension or school expulsion, the authors examined the Education statutes or codes for all 50 states. They examined all statutes or codes related to out-of-school suspension and expulsion for each state and were able to comprise five primary categories: definition/length, types of infractions, alternatives to suspension or expulsion, due process, and corporal punishment. Differences among states in these characteristics were then examined with respect to state rates of out-of-school suspension or expulsion in an attempt to determine which if any of those characteristics predict higher rates of school exclusion.

According to the Indiana Department of Education, the number of Indiana homeschooled children has increased by 400 percent over the past eight years, with a current enrollment total of 22,403.

        "description":"Individual states have a long tradition of providing financial support for their public K-12 schools. This support reflects the state's constitutional requirement to educate its citizens. However, states vary widely in both the amount of funding provided to public schools, and the distribution of funding among schools. The fundamental observation underlying discussions of school finance is that communities vary in the amount of wealth they possess, and that this can affect the financial resources dedicated to providing K-12 education. The most commonly-used indicator of community wealth related to education funding is the assessed valuation of individual and business property within the community. Because communities vary greatly in the amount of taxable property per-pupil, significant variations existed across communities in revenues that could be raised for education. This report provides an overview of the main parts of Indiana's Foundation Program for K-12 education. Rather than focus on the details of the calculations of the Foundation Program, this report describes the purpose of the different parts of the Foundation Program. Readers who are interested in more of the details behind the various calculations presented here are referred to the Digest of Public School Finance, produced by the Indiana Department of Education. As shown here, Indiana's Foundation Program is actually a series of interrelated formulas that are subject to change depending on decisions made by the Indiana Legislature. These changes can affect not only the total amounts of funds given to schools for various purposes, but also how these funds are distributed among corporations. (Contains 6 figures and 19 tables.)",

Interview and survey data from the second and third  briefing papers have demonstrated that: (1) principals are sharply divided in their  attitudes towards zero tolerance, out-of-school suspension, expulsion, and preventive  strategies; (2) differences in principal attitude relate both to the characteristics of school  principals and to outcomes in terms of discipline and prevention; and (3) many Indiana  principals have developed innovative programs which maintain the integrity of the  learning environment and preserve the safety of the school without diminishing students' opportunity to learn. In short, these principals believe that there are different and more effective ways of managing discipline in schools then resorting to removal. One example of how a preventative philosophy can change the disciplinary culture of a school is found in the case of Greenfield Middle School under the leadership of Jim Bever, who became principal during the 1999-2000 school year. Principal Bever is the 2004 Metlife/National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) Indiana Middle School principal of the year honoree. The interviewing staff of the &quot;Children Left Behind Project&quot; were especially intrigued with the story of disciplinary transformation told by Principal Bever.

Much of the current research on full-day kindergarten programs suggests they are. Researchers cite gains such as increased academic achievement, lower grade retention rates, improved attendance, and improved social skills experienced by full-day kindergarten students at the end of the kindergarten year. This research has led to increased program and funding support by legislators around the country. Yet, there has been relatively little evaluation or discourse regarding the impact of full-day kindergarten on students' performance in subsequent grades. The research that has been conducted is far from conclusive.

        "description":"The Indiana General Assembly recognized the importance of updating school library book collections by appropriating $4 million for K-8 schools during the 1997-1999 school years, $6 million for K-12 schools during the 1999-2001 school years, and $6 million for K-12 schools for the 2001-2003 school years. However, due to state budgetary restraints, only $3 million was provided in the 2001-2002 school year and no funds were provided for the 2002-2003 school year nor for subsequent school years. The 2002 report indicated that funding provided between 1997 and 2001 resulted in a sharp increase in purchases and circulation, but that those numbers had either leveled or begun to dip in the partially-funded cycle (Plucker et al., 2002). This report reviews the current state of library services in Indiana public schools in light of these developments, as well as trends in school enrollment and book purchasing and circulation. Two types of data analysis were utilized in preparing this report. Survey results (n = 3,111) from Indiana public schools serving children in kindergarten through eighth grade were compared across 2000, 2002, and 2004 school years, using analysis of variance methods. In addition, the comments of 185 Indiana public school librarians in  response to an open-ended question on the 2004 survey were analyzed. The report  includes text, tables, and graphs illustrating both sets of analyses, as well as representative quotes from survey respondents. The results provide evidence that school libraries are unable to maintain the levels of book purchases and circulation that were seen during the fully-funded 2000 cycle. They report experiencing a great deal of financial stress, uncertainty, and difficulty maintaining services and supporting programmatic initiatives that are viewed as important to state academic goals. The following are appended: (1) 2004 Survey; and (2) Grade Level Taught in Schools by Survey Year. (Contains 6 tables and 6 figures.)",

        "description":"How do Indiana schools use school discipline? The first briefing paper explored controversies at the national level concerning the philosophy and practice of zero tolerance. That exploration found that many of the assumptions of zero tolerance are not supported by evidence. The data suggest that zero tolerance tends to be associated with a number of negative school outcomes, including school dropout, negative school climate, and racial disparities. This information is mostly from studies at the national level, however, and does not necessarily address school discipline in Indiana. Thus, this briefing paper describes school disciplinary practices in this state. Specifically, it describes trends in the use of out-of-school suspension and expulsion in the state for the 2002-2003 school year, and the school and district characteristics that are associated with the use of suspension and expulsion. It also reports on a survey of Indiana's school principals regarding school discipline. Finally, the report explores the relationship for Indiana's students between student discipline and academic achievement. (Contains 1 table, 9 color enhanced figures, and 21 endnotes.)

        "description":"Zero tolerance discipline relies upon a certain set of assumptions about schools, violence, and the outcomes of discipline. In the period of heightened fear about school-based violence during the 1990s, it was not always easy to dispassionately examine  the evidence for different strategies of violence prevention. It seemed imperative to put an end to school shootings immediately, and those strategies promising the shortest route to that goal were often the most appealing. In the last few years, however, there has been an enormous amount of study concerning the most promising methods for preventing school violence and promoting effective school learning climates. Unfortunately, much of this evidence has not supported the assumptions that guided the acceptance of zero tolerance discipline in the 1990s. The purpose of this briefing paper is to examine that evidence. To what extent are the promises and assumptions of zero tolerance borne out by our rapidly increasing knowledge about school violence prevention? (Contains 17 endnotes.)

Published quarterly, it contains informative and entertaining articles on such issues as early childhood curriculum, ethics, health and professional development. This summer issue of the &quot;Every Child&quot; is the tenth anniversary issue. It reflects back to the first edition of &quot;Every Child&quot; which discussed how the new Quality Assurance and Accreditation System had just emerged and how people basked in the knowledge that Australia was the only country in the world to establish a mandated, national accreditation system for long day care centres. Since then the development of a quality assurance system for family day care has been seen. This quality assurance system acknowledges the importance of the nexus between co-ordination unit and carer that is so intrinsic to the quality guarantee in family day care. Quality assurance for outside school hours care, whilst still in its infancy, is an important step in the commitment to assure quality in all services. This issue contains the following sections: (1) The changing contours of early childhood; (2) Quality in children's services; (3) Working with mature-age parents; (3a) Only Connect: The Tasmanian Essential Connections Project; (3b) Early childhood professionals: Leading today and tomorrow; (4) Research: Early childhood educators in 21st century--the challenges; (5) Health; (6) Schools; and (7) Profile and Book Reviews.

Published quarterly, it contains informative and entertaining articles on such issues as early childhood curriculum, ethics, health and professional development. Today, many young children still miss out on early education opportunities. Thousands of families and children, particularly in isolated and disadvantaged communities, cannot access quality formal early childhood care and education services. Australian Bureau of Statistics data show that only 83% of four-year olds participate in formal early childhood education and care and most for less than ten hours a week. Yet the evidence is clear--children with limited opportunities for rich social, literacy and thinking experiences in the years before school are the most vulnerable to school adjustment problems, including behavioural difficulties.

        "description":"The &quot;Everyday Learning&quot; series has been developed to focus attention on the everyday ways in which children can be supported in their growth and development. Many of one's earliest memories are likely to be about time spent in the kitchen. Licking the bowl, setting the table, doing the dishes, chatting about the day, eating a meal, peeling the vegetables, and experimenting with cooking are experiences familiar to many children. The kitchen is not only a place to prepare and store food but also can offer an unlimited number of learning opportunities for children. Science, language, maths, chemistry, physics, reading, nutrition and hygiene knowledge are being used and explored every day in the kitchen. Children who spend time with adults in the kitchen are being offered opportunities to explore all these topics. They will also enjoy sharing with the important people in their lives. This document outlines a range of ways in which babies, toddlers and preschoolers can be involved in the kitchen, stimulating their senses, their thinking and co-ordination skills. It gives parents, grandparents and caregivers ideas that they can share with young children to enhance their developing capacities and make everyday activities fun! Some of the topics highlighted in this issue include: (1) Learning in the kitchen; (2) Babies, Experiences--things to do; (3) Toddlers, Development--what to expect; (4) Preschoolers, Development--what to expect, things to do; and (6) Some useful recipes.

It is for all those who are involved in children's development and learning, including early childhood professionals in all children's services, parents, grandparents and others with an ongoing responsibility for young children. The very early years of children's lives have been shown to be crucial to their development of language and their subsequent capacity to take advantage of preschool and school programs. In this document, the author explains the stages in language development and how the involvement of children in listening to and participating in family conversations, especially before the age of three, enhances their capacity to learn to talk. Suggestions for simple word games to use as a starting point are also included. The progression of young children from joining in with a few simple words to actively contributing to detailed conversations is a delightful aspect of early development--this book shows parents, carers and educators what to expect along the way and how to enhance children's skills in this area. Topics highlighted in this issue include: (1) Talk is important right from the start; (2) First words; (3) Toddlers: One word leads to another; (4) Preschool: Talking, telling, taking turns; (5) Learning to read; and (6) And on to school.

How do you introduce young children to maths in a way which will stimulate their interest in this vital topic? In this book, the authors explore how maths concepts develop and can be encouraged--from simple number rhyme activities with young babies through to counting, recognizing patterns and beginning to understand time with preschoolers. This great book will give parents and carers a terrific resource to encourage young children to begin to see maths used in the everyday world around them and to think about maths ideas. Some topics offered in the book include: (1) Why is numeracy important?; (2) How do children learn numeracy?; (3) Solving everyday problems; (4) Counting; (5) It's the ideas that count!; (6) How children feel about numeracy and mathematics; and (7) Numeracy continues at home.

        "description":"The &quot;Everyday Learning&quot; series has been developed to focus attention on the everyday ways in which children can be supported in their growth and development. It is for all those who are involved in children's development and learning, including people caring for young children in their own or others' homes, such as parents, grandparents and those with an ongoing responsibility for young children. How does one encourage a lively imagination and creative play in young children? Everyday learning about imagination offers some terrific ideas for parents and carers to stimulate the imagination of young children as they develop from babies to preschoolers. Using inexpensive or easily-sourced items, the author outlines how carers can create an environment where youngsters can be encouraged to explore, experience and engage with their surroundings. From classical music to painting or making a treasure box, these activity ideas will enhance the development of young children to their full potential and everyone will have fun along the way! Some of the topics highlighted in the book include: (1) Things to do for all children to support the development of imagination; (2) Develop and support children's curiosity and sense of wonder; and (3) Things to do with: Babies; Toddlers; and Preschoolers. An appendix contains: (1) Music for babies--a selection of CDs; (2) Good classic CDs for toddlers; (3) Other favorites; (4) Books about art; (5) More suggestions for preschoolers; and (6) Web sites. A section listing references and resources is also included. [This document was produced by Early Childhood Australia Inc., formerly known as the Australian Early Childhood Association.]",

Published quarterly, it contains informative and entertaining articles on such issues as early childhood curriculum, ethics, health and professional development. Early childhood educators have long recognised the importance of creative activities and are passionate about promoting children's creativity. Most early childhood curricula have a strong focus on creative experiences--especially in music, movement and visual arts, because of their acknowledged role in enhancing children's intellectual, social and emotional development. This issue of &quot;Every Child&quot; continues to inform the debate on strengthening early childhood services by looking at developments and issues in the broad area of the arts. It focuses on the critical role of the visual arts, music, and movement in preschool and child care programs and especially in developing social and cognitive competencies and preparedness for school.

The books bring together the best information available on wide-ranging topics and are an ideal resource for children's services workers and others interested in the care and education of young children. The complex area of emotional development is one that challenges early childhood teachers, parents, and carers. In this book, the author explores how children can be supported and encouraged to be aware of their feelings and to understand how they can deal with them. The author suggests using a variety of activities from the arts, to enhance the expression of feelings and to address some of the difficult areas. The inclusion of emotional literacy is an important component of early childhood education, to develop each child's full potential. Actively teaching emotional and social development is preferable to a reliance on children developing such skills naturally as they grow--this book offers a great resource to make a start or augment an existing approach. It is organized in the following chapters: (1) Feelings and Early Childhood; (2) Young Children and Feelings; (3) Responding to and Teaching Children about Their Feelings; (4) Activities--Some Specific Activities to Develop Emotional Literacy; and (5) Conclusion.

        "description":"Moving house is becoming a more common aspect of modern life; but this does not make it any easier to cope with the many issues that arise--from the everyday practicalities, to the social and emotional challenges involved. Families who are required to relocate face the potentially difficult task of settling each family member into the new environment. For parents of teenagers, this can be a huge challenge--coping with resistance to leaving old friends, schools and sporting groups, as well as assisting them to find their place in a new setting. &quot;Travelling teens: A Parents' Guide to Family Relocation,&quot; by experienced parenting author and counsellor Pam Linke, covers the issues that teenagers are likely to be grappling with at this stage of their life. The practical strategies offered are based upon research through surveys of parents and teenagers in families of Australian Defence Force members. This book provides expert advice on how to support teens during the relocation process, and to make what is often a difficult situation into a positive experience. The information and strategies in &quot;Travelling Teens&quot; are relevant to any young people who have to move house, from all walks of life. After a foreword and an introduction, the following sections are included: (1) &quot;The First Step&quot;; (2)&quot;Teenagers/Adolescents/Young People -- Who Are They?&quot;; (3) &quot; Changes of Adolescence&quot;; (4) &quot;Tips for Parenting Teens&quot;; (5) &quot;Letting Go&quot;; (6) &quot;When to be Concerned About Your Teenager&quot;; (7) &quot;Some Facts About Change&quot;; (8) &quot;Parents and Change -- Teenagers' Views&quot;; (9) &quot;Moving House with Young People&quot;; (10) &quot;What the Survey Said; (11) What the Teenagers Say; (12) Preparing for the Move; (13) About Education&quot;; (14) &quot;Rituals&quot;; (15) &quot;Finding Your Feet in a New Place&quot;; (16) &quot; About Relationships&quot;; (17) &quot;Making New Friends&quot;; (18) &quot;Getting into the Right Group&quot;; (19) &quot;Keeping Connections with Old Friends&quot;; (20) &quot;Bullying and Teasing&quot;; (21) &quot;Behaviour&quot;; (22) &quot;Talking about Feelings&quot;; (23) &quot;Managing the Hard Things&quot;; (24) &quot;When Your Teen Needs More Help&quot;; and (25) &quot;Positive Learnings from Moving&quot;.

        "description":"After Operation Desert Storm and the end of the Cold War, Congress began to reevaluate the focus of U.S. military activities and proposed using some military assets and training to help address critical domestic challenges such as drugs, poverty, and unemployment. In particular, some policymakers saw an opportunity to use the military's capabilities to address domestic needs by providing role models for youth and training and educational opportunities for the disadvantaged. Section 1091 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 established the National Guard Youth Challenge Program (Challenge Program) as a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of military based training to improve the life skills and employability of high school dropouts. After the program was permanently authorized in 1998, Congress began limiting the share of state operating costs covered by the federal government through the Department of Defense (DOD), which initially paid for 100 percent of these costs. DOD now pays 60 percent of state operating costs, and states provide 40 percent. In addition, the authorizing legislation for the Challenge Program allows the Secretary of Defense to use nondefense funding sources in support of the program. This document reports the findings of the Comptroller General's recent study of the Challenge Program, focusing specifically on: (1) the historical trends of the Challenge Program, including program expenditures, participation, and performance; (2) the extent to which Reserve Affairs and NGB have determined actual program costs and the consequent need to adjust the federal and state cost share; and (3) the extent to which NGB has provided oversight of the program. Also studied was the extent which Reserve Affairs and participating states have made an effort to obtain alternative funding support for the Challenge Program. Appended are: (1) Scope and Methodology; (2) National Guard Youth Challenge Program Sites; (3) Comments from the Department of Defense; and (4) GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgment.

It also examines the percentages of full-time freshmen who received various forms of financial aid, and the median amount received by full-time freshmen at different types of institutions. To capture the interaction between price of attendance and financial aid patterns, the report describes net prices to measure the median price institutions charge after taking financial aid received by students into account. Finally, to further explore these issues over time and to take into account inflation during this period, indices of changes in three different types of prices--tuition, price of attendance, and net price--were developed for this report.",

The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and carried out in 32 countries, including the United States, evaluates 15-year-old students' literacy in three areas: reading, mathematics, and science. The first PISA survey was conducted in 2000, with additional assessments planned on a 3-year cycle. Each survey focuses on one of the three types of literacy; in PISA 2000, reading literacy  was the major focus. Therefore, it is possible to perform a detailed examination of reading literacy within and across countries. In this and other PISA reports, the United States is compared to both the OECD average and other countries participating in PISA. The OECD average is the mean of the scores of each OECD country. PISA participating countries include both OECD and non-OECD countries.",

More specifically, technical assistance can be defined as any assistance that identifies, selects, or designs research-based solutions and practices to support school improvement (Mattson & McDonald, 2005). This newsletter focuses on the critical role collaboration plays when school districts and technical assistance providers formulate, implement, and evaluate a technical assistance plan. Collaboration requires an investment of time on the parts of both the district and the provider; however, it increases the likelihood that the resulting technical assistance will be designed appropriately; delivered efficiently; and, most importantly, result in an  improvement in targeted areas.

        "description":"A major development in the American workforce has been the increased labor force participation of women. In 1970, only about 43 percent of women age 16 and older were in the labor force; by 1999, that figure had risen to 60 percent. From 1999 to 2004, women's labor force participation rate receded slightly to 59.2 percent, still well above the rates that prevailed throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and much of the 1990s. Along with rising labor force participation, women also made substantial inroads into higher paying occupations. In 2004, half of all management, professional, and related occupations were held by women. Women's earnings relative to men's also have risen. From 1979 to 2004, women's earnings as a percent of men's increased by 18 percentage points, from 62 to 80 percent. The  movement of women into the labor force and into higher paying occupations has gone hand in hand with their pursuit of higher education. For example, in 1970, only 11 percent of women age 25 to 64 had completed 4 or more years of college; by 2004, nearly 33 percent held a college degree. This report presents historical and current labor force and earnings data for women and men from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a national monthly survey of approximately 60,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unless otherwise noted, data are annual averages from the CPS.

The average quantitative literacy scores of adults increased 8 points between 1992 and 2003, though average prose and document literacy did not differ significantly from 1992 (figure 1). The literacy tasks in the assessment were drawn from actual texts and documents, which were either used in their original format or reproduced in the assessment booklets. Each question appeared before the materials needed to answer it,  thus encouraging respondents to read with purpose. Respondents were asked to complete an assessment booklet that included seven literacy screening tasks (with questions asked in either English or Spanish but based upon written materials  presented in English only) common to all booklets, followed by three blocks of tasks.  The assessment also included a background questionnaire that was used to collect data about the relationship between literacy and various demographic and background characteristics.",

It provides results in reading, mathematics, science, and writing  in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2005. Specifically, it focuses on the three private school types that combined enroll the greatest proportion of private school students (Catholic, Lutheran, and Conservative Christian) as well as private schools overall. It also compares the performance of students in these schools to that of public school students to provide additional perspective. For the past 30 years, NAEP has reported that students in private schools outperform students in public schools. This report confirms that point, but also looks more closely at NAEP results for those three types of private schools. Combined, these schools enroll the majority of private school students, and they participated in NAEP at most grades in 2000, 2002, and 2003.",

Through collaboration with existing educational providers and economic development initiatives, a program will be developed that affords adults with the opportunity to be served according to their educational needs. The major objective for participants is to attain a marketable, educational credential. The program will assist adults who need additional basic skills or are already academically prepared for college level work but lack the resources to attend college. To ensure that participants are prepared for entry/re-entry into the workforce, participants will also receive job readiness education, career counseling and employer contacts. One strategy of the NGA grant for Arkansas is to expand access to Career Pathways by replicating the pilot project offered at Southeast Arkansas College (SEARK) in Pine Bluff and adding best practices of Career Pathways programs as structured in other states. The end result will be the provision of sequential career training and job placement for low-income, TANF-eligible adults.",

        "description":"As demands for a more advanced workforce increase, the relationship between higher education and economic success is more recognized by leaders in both academia and economic development. As Larry Walther, Director of Arkansas Department of Economic Development, stated in a recent presentation to the Blue Ribbon Committee on Higher Education, &quot;Education is the key to economic development.&quot; Arkansas is 17 years behind the rest of the country in movement away from its dependence on manufacturing. There are dozens of reasons for this lag, but always at the top of the list are education and workforce skills. For most of us, workforce development is typically a product of associate-and baccalaureate level education; however, there is an abundance of information that indicates doctoral education and the research and development (R&amp;D) that frequently accompany it are equally vital to a strong state economy. The purpose of this report is to provide a useful context for Coordinating Board members as they consider new doctoral program proposals and develop further strategies for the delivery of doctoral education in the state. Since the moratorium on doctoral programs expired in January 2003, the Coordinating Board has considered and approved the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) at UAMS. Based on letters of notification and discussions with graduate faculty and staff across the state, the ADHE staff expects to receive six to eight doctoral proposals over the next few months. Appended are: (1) Progress Policy Institute New Economy Index; (2) Arkansas Research Activity Milestones; (3) Timeline for Doctoral Education; (4) Doctoral Programs Offered by Arkansas Institutions; (5) Science and Engineering Graduate Students by State and Institution; (6) Carnegie and SREB Institutional Categories; (7) Carnegie/SREB Institutional Categories for Arkansas Institutions; (8) Degrees Awarded by Arkansas Public Institutions; (9) Report on Doctoral Education, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville; and (10) UAF Graduate School Response to Doctoral Education Review.",

Analysis of the cognitive and social skills assessment scores described in this report, along with contextual variables in the ECLS-K database collected from schools, parents, teachers, and children, provides a basis for policy-relevant examination of growth rates, school influences, and subgroup differences in achievement and growth. While the ECLS-K spans kindergarten through fifth grade, this report documents the psychometric results for the sixth round of data collection, in spring 2004, when approximately 90 percent of the sampled children were in fifth grade. Also included is a review of the salient features of the assessments used in kindergarten through third grade. Among these salient features are the selection and design of assessment instruments and selected psychometric characteristics. Appended are: (1) Score Statistics for Direct Cognitive Measures for Selected Subgroups; (2) ECLS-K Item Parameters by Rounds; (3) ECLS-K Estimated Proportion Correct by Rounds; and (4) ECLS-K Difference between Actual and Estimated Percent Correct by Rounds.

The ECLS-K focuses on children's early school experiences, beginning with kindergarten. It is a multisource, multimethod study that includes interviews with parents; the collection of data from principals, teachers, and student record abstracts; and direct child assessments. The ECLS-K was developed under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the Institute of Education Sciences. Westat is conducting this study with assistance provided by Educational Testing Service (ETS) of Princeton, New Jersey. The Survey Research Center and the School of Education at the University of Michigan assisted Westat in conducting the base year and first-grade studies. The ECLS-K follows a nationally representative cohort of children from kindergarten into high school. The base year data were collected in the fall and spring of the 1998-99 school year when the sampled children were in kindergarten.

Data for this Issue Brief come from the October 2003 Computer and Internet Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a sample survey representative of the civilian noninstitutional population in the United States. The survey is conducted in approximately 56,000 households each month. In October 2003 it collected information regarding 29,075 children enrolled in nursery school through 12th grade. A member of each household who is at least 15 years old provides information about household members. As a result of this data collection method, data regarding computer and Internet use by students were not collected directly from students in most cases, but from another member of the household; this method is a potential source of error. Computer users are identified by questions that ask if the subject uses computers at home, at work, or at school. Internet users are identified by questions that ask if the subject uses the Internet at any location. (For further detail about CPS survey methods, see U.S. Census Bureau 2002). The use of computers and the Internet by students is commonplace and begins early. In upper grade levels, nearly all students use computers and a substantial majority use the Internet. Even before kindergarten, a majority of nursery school children use computers, and 23 percent use the Internet. (Contains 1 color enhanced table and 4 endnotes.)",

At the same time, competing demands for the state funds that would support community colleges have resulted in reduced public allocations and higher student tuition fees. Understandably, therefore, both state policymakers and parents are increasingly focused on the returns to their public or private investments in education, and the outcomes of community college attendance are now under greater scrutiny. To facilitate the evaluation of the colleges, there are now available data, through the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act (1990), which amended the Higher Education Act, on every college's graduation rate for fall semester cohorts of first-time, fulltime (FTFT) students in degree programs. This information is known as the Student Right-to-Know (SRK) data. Given the importance of completions, this Brief reports on research conducted by the Community College Research Center designed to strengthen the public's ability to assess and compare community college performance by measuring the effect of certain institutional characteristics on graduation rates. The research consisted of the development of models, based on SRK graduation rate data, which can identify the institutional characteristics that might influence those rates and then measure the effect of those characteristics on the rates. The ultimate goal of the research is to help community college?s improve the educational outcomes of their students.",

The students in the sample were age 25 or older with, at most, a high school education. The study was conducted by staff at the Washington State Board of Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC), with assistance from the Community College Research Center, as part of Ford's Bridges to Opportunity initiative. Its goal was to provide educators throughout Washington's community and technical college system with a detailed profile of their low-skill adult students, who make up about one-third of the approximately 300,000 students served by the system annually. The study also sought to identify the critical points where adult students drop out or fail to advance to the next level in order to help SBCTC staff stimulate thinking among educators throughout the system about how to bridge those gaps and thereby facilitate student advancement.",

Much of the existing literature on college persistence and completion is focused on baccalaureate students and pays little attention to students in community colleges, and even fewer studies consider differences by students' program of study. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether students in occupational programs in community colleges persist in postsecondary education and attain degrees at similar rates as their academic and baccalaureate peers. Associate Occupational students achieve their stated goals less often than their academic counterparts. Moreover, their record is particularly problematic when compared with baccalaureate students. Part of this difference can be explained by differences in student characteristics and expectations, but the gap still remains after controlling for many of those factors.  Research, therefore, suggests that postsecondary institutions have yet to determine and implement the optimal approach to providing direct occupational preparation within an institutional structure that continues to rest on a foundation oriented towards academic education.

        "description":"The educational effectiveness of community colleges is under new scrutiny as a result of both a federal government focus on accountability of higher education institutions and  greater competition for the state funds traditionally directed to the colleges. Policymakers, who want to tie public college allocations to their outcomes, and families, who are investing sizeable amounts in increased community college tuition, want assurances that the colleges will provide educational returns that justify their cost.  Community colleges must collect and report graduation and transfer rates, based on the outcomes of fall semester cohorts of first-time, full-time students in degree programs, to meet the requirements of the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act (1990). Current convention is to use these Student Right-to-Know (SRK) data as the measure of a college's effectiveness, and they indicate that completion rates are very low for community colleges overall. Indeed, more than half the students who enroll eventually leave without a credential. But the value of SRK data as appropriate measures for outcome-based accountability is disputed by college advocates, who assert that they are not accurate reflections of student success for a variety of reasons. This Brief summarizes research conducted by the Community College Research Center that used data on student characteristics and educational outcomes from several federal government sources to explore the legitimacy of the various ways that college effectiveness can be assessed by using measures of student success. It takes account of the sometimes competing measurement preferences of the interested parties and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each.",

This effort has been partly driven by an increased emphasis on outcome accountability, but it has also promoted a productive discussion about improving institutional performance. The research reported here has two related goals. One goal is to work towards strengthening the ability to assess and compare institutional performance. We thus have developed a model that can be used to adjust simple graduation rates for institutional characteristics, such as student composition, college resources, size, and location, all of which might influence those rates. Our long-term goal is to understand how to improve student outcomes, so the paper also uses the model to measure the effect of those institutional characteristics on graduation rates. We use data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) surveys, applying a weighted least-squares procedure for grouped data to estimate an institutional-completion rates model. This analysis confirms several hypotheses about institutional determinants of graduation rates at community colleges. Our results indicate a consistent negative relationship between enrollment size and completion. Additionally, colleges with high shares of minority students, part-time students, and women have lower graduation rates. A final significant finding among institutional characteristics is that greater instructional expenditures are related to a greater likelihood of graduation. The method developed here can be used to better assess the performance of community colleges. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

Employers reward new hires for having the skills or credentials needed for their job,  underscoring the importance of having either the requisite \"tools in your toolbox,\" or some basic academic preparation to continue on into postsecondary education. This stress on knowledge acquisition has contributed to a growing wage gap between high school and college graduates. In general, the experience of individuals in the three samples considered in this Brief demonstrated that economic outcomes improved with education in expected ways (see the box on page 4 of this Brief for information on data sources and sample populations for this study). Higher levels of education were associated with more stable and economically sustaining employment outcomes, and employment outcomes improved as individuals completed more years of education. The authors findings generally support the conclusion that students benefit from a community college education when compared with those who have only a high school diploma. They also found that community college occupational students do at least as well as, and in some cases significantly better than, students in academic programs. Moreover, certificate and associate degree holders generally have higher returns to education than do individuals with similar years of postsecondary education but no credential; however, in some instances the difference is not statistically significant. Finally, there are noticeable differences in the returns to postsecondary education and degrees by gender, with women generally experiencing a greater economic benefit from schooling and credentials than do men.",

        "description":"These are critical times for Ohio's system of educating its young people. Initiatives to reform the public schools have been gaining momentum for some time. Elected officials, organized interest groups, think tanks, and civic leaders are tugging and pulling at the system, trying to  move it this way or that. But where do the people of Ohio--the parents and taxpayers--truly stand on the education issues of the day? The Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, sensing it was time to check with the public, asked the FDR Group--a national nonpartisan research company with expertise in surveys, focus groups, and program evaluation--to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous study of the attitudes of Ohioans. The study is based upon 1,001 telephone interviews with randomly selected Ohioans, including 278 parents of students in grades K-12. The sample is augmented so that the views of African Americans (202 were interviewed) and Dayton residents (201 were interviewed) could be reliably reported as well. The survey asks participants for their views on the state of the public schools, academic standards, charter schools, school vouchers, and teacher quality. It was found that 42 percent of Ohio residents believe that a high school diploma from their local public schools is &quot;no guarantee that the typical student has learned the basics.&quot; Among African Americans, it is 54 percent. The vast majority of Ohioans (69 percent) believe that if their state decided to put more money into the public schools the money would &quot;actually get lost along the way.&quot; Most (58 percent) believe that the taxpayers in their community are not getting their money?s worth from the public schools. Among African Americans, it's 72 percent.51 percent think that social promotion is the rule in Ohio today; just 27 percent believe that students are promoted &quot;only when they learn what they are supposed to know. 49 percent of parents with kids in public district schools say they would exit the system and send their kids to a private school, if money were not an issue.",

        "description":"The mission of this review is to appraise the new draft NAEP science framework and to determine whether it is up to snuff. This is an evaluation of the September 30, 2005, draft document, Science Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (Framework), developed for the National Assessment Governing Board. The criteria is listed first and that is followed with an account of their application to the reviewing task. The review then expresses the quantitative outcome as a set of average scores for each of 21 criteria, then as the average summed score for all criteria (the \"raw\" score), and finally as a conversion to an average percentage score (\"final score\"). On the basis of the final score, a letter grade is assigned the Framework, using the familiar A through F scale. A series of short summary statements responds to questions on which NAGB seeks feedback. In closing, it seeks briefly to justify this response; that is, to convey appreciation of some qualities of the Framework and concerns about others, and to make some recommendations. Following  the Foreword, (Chester E. Finn, Jr., and Michael J. Petrilli), and the Introduction, table of contents for  this report is organized in the following manner: (1) Criteria; (2) Number and Letter Grade; (3) Responses to NAGB Questions; (4) Plaudits; (5) Concerns; and (6) Recommendations.

        "description":"The &quot;Everyday Learning&quot; series has been developed to focus attention on the everyday ways in which children can be supported in their growth and development. It is for all those who are involved in children's development and learning, including early childhood professionals in all children's services, parents, grandparents and others with an ongoing responsibility for young children. The earliest and most important lessons--about communication, cooperation and understanding--develop from family relationships. The rough and tumble of daily life encourages brothers and sisters to learn such lessons, which last a lifetime. This book gives helpful advice to parents about how to make the addition of a new baby to the family a positive experience for toddlers and preschoolers. The book offers a range of strategies: preparing for the new arrival; balancing the needs of all children; and dealing with difficult situations which can arise, such as sibling rivalry or a sibling with a disability. Covering all types of families, this book will be a valuable resource for all parents and carers. The book is divided into four sections. The first of these sections, the introduction, contains the following chapters: (1) Why Are Families Important?; (2) Position; (3) Sex of the Child; and (4) Space between Siblings. Section 2, Toddlers and a New Baby in the Family, includes: (1) What to Do ... Before the Baby Arrives in a Family; (2) When Mum Is in Hospital; (3) When the Second Baby Comes Home; (4) Ways to Help the Toddler Accept a New Baby; and (5) Things to Do in Difficult Situations. Section 3, Preschoolers, contains: (1) Preschool Children and Their Brothers and Sisters; (2) Sibling Rivalry; (3) Siblings with Disabilities; (4) Things to Do to Help Brothers and Sisters Cope with a Disabled Sibling; and (5) When to Seek Help.

The government must act now to improve the gathering and analysis of information, advance international diplomacy, and support military operations. They must act to retain the global market leadership and succeed against increasingly sophisticated competitors whose workforces possess potent combinations of professional skills, knowledge of other cultures, and multiple language proficiencies. The domestic well-being demands action to provide opportunities for all students to learn foreign languages important for the Nation, develop the capabilities of their heritage communities, and ensure services that are core to the quality of life. This White Paper responds to the urgent need for a national strategy on foreign languages and cultural competency. It is the result of an unprecedented gathering of language and policy experts drawn from Federal, state, and local government; elementary, secondary and postsecondary education; heritage language communities; and the private/commercial sector. This White Paper presents recommendations designed to build the ability of Americans to operate more effectively inside and outside the country's borders in languages and cultures that are critical to the Nation?s future.

As a consequence, many first-rate practitioners leave the schools and others who could be exceptional teachers never consider teaching. Worse still, the knowledge and skills of the fine teachers who remain often are underutilized, their positive influence allowed only the most modest scope. In recognition of these challenges the nation has begun to take several steps forward. The leadership of the nation's education community has coalesced to create a National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The National Board's mission is to advance the quality of teaching and learning by: (1) maintaining high and rigorous standards for what accomplished teachers should know and be able to do; (2) providing a national voluntary system certifying teachers who meet these standards, and (3) advocating related education reforms to integrate National Board Certification in American education and to capitalize on the expertise of National Board Certified Teachers.

        "description":"This study was undertaken to identify the common characteristics of high-performing schools in Tennessee, to determine if these features were consistent with what other studies of high-performing schools have reported, and to consider whether any of the identified components had any potential for being employed to improve student achievement in low-performing schools. Six schools (i.e., two elementary, two middle, and two high schools) were selected from a group of schools identified as high-performing  based on a set of mathematics and English/language arts performance indicators. Interviews of teachers and administrators, based on Edvantia's Framework for Transforming Low-Performing Schools into High-Performing Learning Communities, were conducted in the six schools. In addition, a battery of surveys were administered to the schools teachers and administrators. School documents (e.g., student handbooks, school newsletters) were collected during school visits and were reviewed. The researchers found that high-performing schools in Tennessee were characterized by dedicated, hard-working teachers who were implementing curricula described as being aligned with state standards and working within school cultures of high expectations for student and teacher performance. Furthermore, school leaders were described as making teaching and learning the schools central focus. At these schools, teachers employed multiple assessment strategies and used data to make instructional decisions to implement differentiated teaching strategies in order to meet the learning needs of their students. For this particular set of high-performing schools in Tennessee, all of these things occurred in an environment of strong parent interest and community support. Based on the findings, the researchers suggest there are five things that teachers and administrators in low-performing schools might consider to improve student achievement: (1) Emphasize high expectations for student behavior and learning--if students are expected to behave and achieve, most will rise to the challenge. (2) Emphasize high expectations for teachers--effective teaching is hard work that always seems to present new challenges. (3) Work hard--getting and sustaining high levels of student achievement takes dedicated effort; high student achievement is not a state achieved but a process maintained.; (4) Focus on effective teaching--focus on mentoring, collaboration, meaningful professional development, and the use of data to make instructional decisions as the means by which teachers learn to develop and implement instruction adapted to the learning needs of students; and (5) Involve the parents--engage parents in the education of their children.

        "description":"In 2001, the Tennessee Department of Education identified underperforming schools from across the state as Corrective Action schools. Corrective Action schools are among those that failed to meet federal and state guidelines for adequate yearly progress (AYP). The present study was conducted to examine the key features of 9 Corrective Action schools that made AYP during the 2003-2004 school year and to compare those findings to the attributes of 15 Corrective Action schools that failed to make AYP during the same year. Interviews of staff at participating schools yielded differences in perceptions of an Aligned and Balanced Curriculum, Purposeful Student Assessment, and Shared Goals for Learning when components of high-performing school indicators were analyzed. The Continuous School Improvement Questionnaire (CSIQ) and the Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI) survey also uncovered differences between those schools that made AYP and those that did not. Specifically, scores on the Aligned and Balanced Curriculum, Purposeful Student Assessment, Shared Goals for Learning, Learning Culture, Peer Reviewed Practice, Expectations for Student Performance, and Technical Resources scales showed significant differences between those schools that made AYP and those that did not. Evidence was found that, at the middle school level, parents of students at schools making AYP responded more positively on the average regarding communication between parents and teachers and the value of celebration of student successes and requests for parent input. Interestingly, at the elementary level, there was also evidence that parents of students at schools not making AYP responded more positively regarding the provision of a newsletter by the school, attendance at Open House, and involvement in parent/teacher organizations.

In response, laboratory staff developed and subsequently delivered Assessment and Intervention in a Comprehensive Literacy Classroom, a five-module course delivered over 16 weeks. The course was designed to help K-3 teachers, K-12 special education teachers, and building-level administrators incorporate formal and informal assessments into their reading instruction and use the results of those assessments to guide instruction. The course was organized and delivered in five modules that covered the following topics: (1) a conceptual model of a comprehensive literacy classroom in which all children can learn to read by the end of the third grade; (2) the five essential elements of reading instruction; (3) the Tennessee assessment system and the four types of assessments (screening, diagnosis, outcome, and progress monitoring); (4) assessment instruments, implementation steps, and practice opportunities; and (5) use of assessment data to guide planning, grouping for instruction, and selection of instructional strategies.

        "description":"Good questions, effectively delivered are a key feature of learning and teaching. QUILT is a research-based, field-tested professional development program designed to assist teachers in developing and implementing effective questioning skills to facilitate student learning. The QUILT framework presents classroom questioning as a five-stage process: (1) question preparation; (2) presentation of questions; (3) prompting; (4) processing of student responses; and (5) reflection on questioning practice. A pilot study of the effects of QUILT on student achievement was conducted to explore the feasibility of an efficacy study of QUILT and to identify the methodological issues that would have to be addressed in its conduct. Twenty-eight fifth-and sixth-grade elementary school teachers in a rural school district in Kentucky were trained to implement QUILT as a teaching/learning strategy. During the spring of 2005, the teachers videotaped three different mathematics instructional sessions in which they used QUILT questioning techniques. Each tape was viewed by researchers from the Appalachia Educational Laboratory at Edvantia, Inc., and summarized using a special coding sheet. The QUILT behaviors were examined in relation to gains in mathematics achievement. This was accomplished using the mathematics section of the Measures of Academic Progress (Northwest Evaluation Association, 2005). The findings indicate that teachers implemented some QUILT questioning behaviors but not others in some of their mathematics instructional lessons and that a well controlled, randomized control trial is needed to examine the efficacy of QUILT as an effective instructional technique, being sure to address teacher training, fidelity of implementation, and assessment of student achievement issues.",

According to Fink (1993), baseline evaluation data allow for subsequent analyses of the effect or impact of a program. The purpose of this study is to set a baseline prior to full implementation of the PD schools framework. Two evaluation-oriented goals were set: (1) to compare the perception of professional staffs at PD and matching schools across several school quality dimensions; and (2) to see if there are any statistically significant differences between PD and matching schools in student achievement. If differences between PD and matching schools exist, then the evaluators can statistically adjust for such differences in subsequent analyses. Furthermore, statistical significance testing during the baseline year will also allow the evaluators to examine whether PD and matching schools were significantly different prior to full implementation of the PD schools framework.

        "description":"Although transitioning from school to school can be challenging at any level, the transition to high school may be particularly fraught with challenge because students are experiencing a change in schools as well as the physical, emotional, and psychological changes inherent to adolescence. Educators and researchers agree that ninth grade is a pivotal year for students. It is typically the year that marks the transition into high school and plays a crucial role in setting the stage for future educational outcomes. Success or failure during the freshman year of high school is directly linked to the probability that a student will drop out before graduation (Legters, 2005). Neild, Stoner-Eby, and Furstenberg (2001) demonstrated that student outcomes in the ninth grade contribute substantially to the researchers ability to predict whether or not a student would drop out of high school, over and above student background variables such as family and peer relationships.

Cross-age tutoring refers to older students tutoring younger students. Studies of cross-age tutoring have reported improved academic performance for both tutors and tutees. The present study was conducted to determine the extent to which cross-age tutoring employed in a rural setting would produce outcomes similar to those reported in urban settings and in other countries. A between/within repeated measures experimental design was used to gauge the effects of cross-age tutoring on learning and retaining knowledge of fraction manipulations. Participating students were randomly assigned to one of four groups: tutors, tutees, nontutors, and nontutees. Tutors and nontutors were seventh- and eighth-grade students at one of two small elementary schools in the same rural district. Tutees and nontutees were third-, fourth-, or fifth-grade students attending the same rural elementary school. Analyses of both knowledge gain and retention scores revealed no significant differences in knowledge of fraction manipulations between tutors and nontutors, tutors and tutees, or tutees and nontutees.

        "description":"Background: Across the nation, data on school performance indicate that, as a  group, African American children and youth are not faring well. Educators, researchers,  and community organizations have stressed that community engagement and  involvement in the education of these youth is a key element in reversing current trends.  Yet, while most educators want to involve parents and community in the education  process, few know now to build the collaborative relationships necessary. Purpose: This qualitative case study examines the efforts of one community initiative to mobilize community efforts to improve the achievement of African American students. The purpose of this research was to illuminate the complex interrelationships within the African American community involved with the MAACK and between the community and school system. This case study addresses the following questions: (1) How do MAACK participants perceive their capability to advocate for the education of children, particularly African American students of low socioeconomic status (SES)?; (2) What is the format and substance of communication between school district personnel, MAACK participants, and other community members about education?; (3) What is the format and substance of communication among MAACK participants about education, particularly of African American and low SES children?; (4) What advocacy efforts MAACK Community members undertake, and what are the results?; (5) What, if any, effects do teachers perceive the MAACK Community Initiative having on school-community connections?; and (6) What factors are perceived by teachers and MAACK participants as contributing to parent and community involvement or noninvolvement? Setting: The study took place in Kanawha County, West Virginia. Kanawha County School District is the largest and most urban district in the state. In this county African American students make up twelve percent of public school students. Most African American students are concentrated in inner-city, low-income neighborhoods and schools. Participants: For the case study, 22 individuals associated with the MAACK Community Initiative were interviewed, including community members, district and school administrators, teachers and REL staff at Edvantia involved in the project. Additional data were drawn from meeting minutes, reports, and newspaper articles. Activity: The MAACK Community Initiative was an attempt to develop school/community partnerships characterized by two-way communication and true collaboration. The work of the MAACK has addressed two broad goals: (1) inform policies, programs, and strategies to address the achievement gap; and (2) work with community organizations to disseminate information to parent and students and to expand participation in community youth programs. The primary strategies for achieving these goals included: (1) school/community dialogues and (2) dissemination of information about the achievement gap and about school and community youth programs. Data Collection and Analysis: The case study method allows investigators to retain the holistic and meaningful characteristics of real-life events, in this case organizational processes (Yin, 2003). The case study is the method of choice when the phenomenon under study is not readily distinguishable from its context and when an examination of the complex interactions between a phenomenon and its context is desired (Yin, 1993). Data were collected through document reviews and semi-structured interviews. Documents reviewed included meeting minutes, work plans, work logs, Edvantia reports concerning the MAACK project, and newspaper articles. Interviews were conducted with 22 individuals with connections to the MAACK Community Initiative. The data obtained through the document reviews and interviews were coded by theme. Data from multiple sources provided triangulation and ensured a more comprehensive description of the themes identified. Findings: The MAACK has experienced significant success in bringing attention to the underachievement of African American students, increasing enrollment in community youth programs, and establishing professional development schools to develop and implement strategies aimed at closing the achievement gap. However, the MAACK faces a number of challenges in continuing and expanding its efforts. These challenges include (1) maintaining effective communication with the school system; (2) involving a more diverse group of community members and educators; and (3) keeping people actively engaged in the effort. Conclusions: While the flexibility of the MAACK and its ability to take on projects as they arise is a definite strength, the lack of a clear strategic plan to guide its work is a weakness. A strategic plan, periodically updated, with both long-term and short-term goals and objectives would help keep people involved by providing them with specific issues and activities toward which to devote their time and energy and maintaining one of the strengths of the organization, its flexibility. The MAACK Community Initiative now also needs to build on and strengthen the relationships developed during the dialogue process and the subsequent work.

        "description":"The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) began, upon its institution in 2002, to hold states more directly accountable for the progress of all students, including students of color and students of low socioeconomic status (SES). These groups of students have historically performed less well than their White or upper-class peers. In 2001, prior to the passage of NCLB, officials from Kanawha County Schools (KCS) and local community members began addressing educational inequities for African American students. The district had not been successful in its attempts to help African American students make gains in achievement test and ACT scores, college preparedness, or high school graduation rates. Further, KCS had received a citation from the U.S. Office of Civil Rights because of the disproportional representation of African American students in certain special education categories. The intent of this study was to describe the perceptions and experiences of a particular group (MAACK Community Initiative leaders and participants). A qualitative research paradigm was selected for this study because it was largely an investigation of a social phenomenon, undertaken by intensively comparing, contrasting, and classifying participants' experiences, and perceptions (Yin, 2003). The data presented here paint a complex picture of the laboratory's role in the MAACK community initiative. However, some conclusions based on the data can be stated clearly: (1) Laboratory staff provided necessary structure and organization to MAACK meetings and activities; (2) Laboratory staff gathered and disseminated educational achievement data and other relevant school data; (3) Laboratory staff facilitated challenging and emotionally charged discussions between community members and school district personnel regarding the achievement gap; and (4) Laboratory staff collaborated with MAACK members to produce relevant print documents and online materials to educate and engage African Americans, but most people interviewed could not describe particular instances of collaboration.

        "description":"Building capacity within schools and districts for continuous improvement is a goal of educators at all levels across the United States of America. An important first step in capacity building is identifying schools' current strengths and weaknesses. Schools can then begin building upon existing strengths to implement improvement initiatives. Further, they can target professional development in those areas identified as weaknesses, to build readiness within the school to improve in the future. The Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI) is a tool schools can use to help determine the most appropriate focus of improvement initiatives and professional development programs. The primary purposes of the \"MSCI User Manual and Technical Report\" are to describe the technical aspects of the MSCI instrument and to provide users of the instrument with a practical manual to aid in the use and interpretation of the MSCI results. This manual describes the history, research base, and development of the instrument as well as its statistical properties, including its reliability and validity. Normative information, for use in interpreting results and comparing a school's performance with that of similar schools, is also included in detail. General procedures for administering the instrument are outlined; more detailed administration specifications are included with instrument packets sent to schools that decide to employ the MSCI. Chapters include: (1) Introduction to the Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI) User Manual and Technical Report; (2) The Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI): An Overview; (3) A Review of the Literature About School Capacity; (4) History and Development of the Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI); (5) Norming the Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI); (6) Instrument Properties of the Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI); and (7) Normative Information for the Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI). Appended are: (1) MSCI Normative Information Using Scaled Scores; (2) Instructions for Administering the MSCI; and (3) Measure of School Capacity for Improvement (MSCI).

        "description":"Online assessment of any type is attractive to educators because it allows large amounts of student data to be gathered and accessed quickly. Indeed, online, summative assessments--generally end-of-course, state-level, and placement exams--are making the annual student testing ritual a meaningful audit instead of what some call an &quot;autopsy&quot; because data reports arrive too late to have any impact on student learning. Yet educators now want meaningful data sooner and more regularly to plan instruction and intervention. That's where online, formative assessments come in. In June of 2005, the Appalachia Educational Laboratory (AEL) at Edvantia, Inc., and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) held a one-day symposium prior to CCSSO's National Conference on Large-Scale Assessment. The purpose of the event was to discuss issues related to standards-based, formative assessment delivered online. The Institute for the Advancement of Emerging Technologies in Education (IAETE) at AEL coordinated the symposium. The large number of attendees, as well as their comments throughout the day, clearly indicate that the topic resonated with states and districts; the results of CCSSO surveys of issues important to its membership also indicate great interest in the topic.",

        "description":"Online assessment promises a faster and more useful return of data about student performance in states accountability assessments. The prospect of gaining quick access to such information is alluring, and many states are creating new assessments for an online environment in order to obtain it. This period of retooling presents a significant additional opportunity--that of improving the assessment of students with disabilities. By employing universal design principles--i.e., using methods that take differing abilities into consideration from the start of a project-states can maximize the effectiveness of their new assessments for measuring the knowledge and skills of students with disabilities, while also improving the speed and usefulness of their systems generally. Adapting universal design practices can guide assessment developers as they work to capture the considerable potential of online environments to give educators a better picture of student learning. Universal design of assessment is specifically intended to benefit those students who have physical disabilities or learning disabilities that impede their interpretation of assessment items or their responses to them. Secondary benefits for all students, however, are likely to be the final result. This brief outlines the potential of acting during this historical moment to significantly improve accountability assessments through universal design of their online versions. Success with universal design will require collaboration among individuals with expertise in several distinct areas of specialized knowledge--including universal design, special education, online technology systems and applications, assistive technology, assessment, and content standards--all working within an environment of evolving legislation. This document provides an overview of the various facets of this congruence of specialties, discusses the potential of their interplay, and encourages a joint effort as states create online assessments.

(formerly AEL) and the National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE) initiated an effort to identify successful strategies for recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers in rural areas. They reviewed non-rural-specific and rural-specific research and practice literature, surveyed rural superintendents across the nation, and conducted case studies of three Virginia programs that support teacher recruitment and retention. Generally, the literature shows that the problem of teacher shortages varies across geography, demography, and subject area. The schools that find it hardest to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers are those in highly urban and rural areas (especially those serving minority or low-income students) and schools in the Southeast, Southwest, and the West. Especially needed are teachers in special education, bilingual education, math, and science. Edvantia/NASBE survey results and case studies amplify these findings and offer insights into challenges and promising practices in rural teacher recruitment and retention.

The goal was to help the schools in Petersburg move toward full accreditation in the state's accountability system. Unlike three other intervention models being tested in Virginia, Model IV called for placing one school improvement specialist in each of the division's 10 schools and another school improvement specialist in the central office. Of the four models, only Model IV involves working at the school divisions central office. Edvantia selected The CNA Corporation (CNAC) to conduct a formative and summative evaluation of the Model IV Intervention implementation and impact. This report presents the final evaluation findings for the Model IV Intervention implemented in the Petersburg City Schools Division during school years 2002-2003 through 2004-2005 of the 3-year divisionwide school improvement project. The report presents an analysis of the fidelity with which the intervention was implemented. It explores the role and effectiveness of the school improvement specialists; the collaboration among the division's central office, the schools, and school improvement specialists; the completeness of each school's School Improvement Plan (SIP); and the changes that have occurred in school climate and capacity for improvement. Included is a comparative analysis of the percentages of students passing the Standards of Learning (SOL) tests in Petersburg and comparison schools during the four years prior to the Model IV Intervention and the two years for which student achievement data are available since the intervention was initiated.

These modules are intended to provide training materials for educators seeking professional development to prepare them for a new level of work. The following modules are presented in this document: (1) Shared Leadership Module; (2) Learning Culture Module; (3) School-Family-Community Connections; (4) Effective Teaching; (5) Shared Goals for Learning; (6) Aligned and Balanced Curriculum; and (7) Purposeful Student Assessment. each module has three sections: (1) Standards: Each set of content standards and performance indicators helps school improvement specialists assess their skills and knowledge related to each topic. The rubric format provides both a measurement for self-assessment and goals for self-improvement. (2) Improving Schools: These briefs provide research--and practice-based information to help school improvement specialists consider how they might address strengths and weaknesses in the schools where they work. The information contained in the briefs is often appropriate for sharing with teachers and principals; each includes information about strategies and practices that can be implemented in schools, resources to be consulted for more information, tools for facilitating thinking about and working on school issues, and real-life stories from school improvement specialists who offer their advice and experiences. (3) Literature Review: The reviews of research literature summarize the best available information about the topic of each module. They can be used by school improvement specialists to expand their knowledge base and shared with school staffs as part of professional development activities. This matrix measures the extent to which a school improvement specialist has the knowledge and skills to following characteristics: (1) a widespread view among all stakeholders that leadership is shared; (2) the existence of mechanisms for involving teachers, students, and parents in decision making; (3) opportunities for leadership development among the members of the school community; (4) the sharing of information and open flow of communications; and (5) school administrators actively listening to and soliciting the input of others.

The first objective of this field test was to expand the four-point Likert-type response scale to six points in order to yield more variance in responses. The second objective was to secure a larger and more diverse group of respondents to complete the six-response option version of the same 64 items as employed in the first field test. The third objective was to analyze the responses from this second field test to discover its psychometric properties. These analyses included: internal consistency reliability estimates, test-retest reliability estimates, construct validity assessment via factor analyses, and the correlations among the scales emerging from the factor analyses and with the total score. The fourth objective was to compare the results of the first field test with those of the second field test and the fifth objective was to make recommendations for the next steps with the AEL MSCI based on those field comparisons.

The conversation began with the importance of defining technology literacy, identifying a range of definitions rather than precise limits. There was, however, consensus that ICT literacy--which can be viewed as one component of technological literacy--implies both  basic computer skills and the cognitive abilities associated with using those tools for learning and communication. The panelists then turned to the emerging possibilities  for assessing via simulation, the new design processes needed for any computer-based assessment, and the lack of research to assist assessment developers in this new  territory. The Soapbox forums sponsor discussion among educators, education  researchers, technology industry leaders, and others interested in technology's role in advancing education.

        "description":"The primary responsibility for the financing of U.S. primary and secondary education rests with state and local governments. In 1970-1971, local governments had, by far, the greatest role in education financing, providing 52.5% of the total education revenue. State governments contributed 39.1% of total education revenue. Since the early 1970s, the states financial responsibility has increased such that in academic year (AY) 2001-2002 the state governments 49.3% share was considerably larger than the local governments share of 42.9% (U.S. Department of Education, 2004). Even though states have assumed a larger financial role, local governments continue to be an important source of revenue for primary and secondary education. The largest source of local funds for education comes from the local property tax. However, given the unequal intrastate distribution of property wealth, combined with the extensive use of local property taxes to fund the local portion of education expenditures, it is not surprising that state education finance systems have been challenged in the state courts. Since 1972, nearly every state has witnessed a state constitutional challenge to its system of locally financed primary and secondary education. Between 1971 and 1999, plaintiffs in 17 states won state Supreme Court judgments that led to either overturning the state education finance systems or significantly altering them. Recent increases in the states share of total education revenue can be largely explained as a result of state court decisions, which reduced the reliance on local property taxes.

MAACK stands for Maximizing Achievement for African American Children in Kanawha. The AEL MASC was designed to determine students' perceptions about themselves as students and about their school experiences. The survey also examines students' perceptions of their families' awareness of and involvement in their children's school lives. All of these factors are strongly related to student performance; if students do not feel they have a supportive school environment as well as family support, they are less likely to perform well in school. Finally, the survey is designed to facilitate comparisons among the perceptions of groups of students according to their gender or ethnicity.

EC-TIIS' ultimate goal was to improve technology services to young children with disabilities by offering access to effective family and professional development materials in a web-based system of learning opportunities organized in an easy-to-use, accessible format. EC-TIIS combined training content from tested and effective early childhood technology related projects into a series of nine online workshops designed to provide needed knowledge and skills to adults responsible for educational programs for young children. Workshops include: (1) Adaptations; (2) Computer Environment; (3) Curriculum Integration; (4) Emergent Literacy; (5) Expressive Arts; (6) Family Participation; (7) Math, Science, and Social Studies; (8) Software Evaluation; and (9) Technology Assessment. Each workshop contains text, graphics of children using technology, links to outside resources, and downloadable files of curriculum activities, articles, and further information about each topic. The technologies addressed include: computers, software, adaptive input and output devices, digital cameras, digital video, scanners, and other electronic media. Participants included teachers from four field test sites and an eight-member Advisory Panel of professionals and family members. These 12 participants provided feedback and assistance in planning and developing the website in regards to appearance, content, and navigation. Project staff disseminated information about the EC-TIIS website during 13 conference presentations. Five presentations focused specifically on the EC-TIIS website and online training.",

The Expressive Arts (EA) model, developed and tested during a 5-year model demonstration period beginning in 1992, was developed for diverse ethnic and cultural groups. Individuals with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities were part of the planning, implementation, and evaluation process.

It goes beyond previous reports by Harvard's Civil Rights Project to study the impact of resegregation in districts whose where court orders have been ended and includes new data on the present situation of the four communities involved in the first &quot;Brown&quot; decision a half century ago as well as of a number of districts whose subsequent cases produced decisive changes in the law of school desegregation. It also considers the very different desegregation levels in communities of differing sizes. Finally, it reviews the broad sweep of segregation changes nationally, regionally, and by state since the 1954 &quot;Brown&quot; decision. It shows that the movement that began with the Supreme Court decision has had an enduring impact but that we are experiencing the largest backward movement in the South, where the court decisions and civil rights laws had produced the most integrated schools in the nation for three decades.

Early indications suggest that states are differently positioned to assume the additional responsibilities required under NCLB. While there has been some intergovernmental collaboration and cooperation, the ambitious expectations, strict timelines, and exacting set of regulations combined with the fiscal constraints operating on states imposed significant burdens on state and local implementation. It is the authors perspective that NCLB is testing the limits of the federal system with a fundamentally different model-one that assumes that by centralizing rules and educational policy, institutions and practice can be rapidly changed to accommodate new requirements. This research on the status of federal-state relationships during the first year indicates that many of the conditions that would facilitate implementation of NCLB are not there.

        "description":"Every year, across the country, a dangerously high percentage of students disproportionately poor and minority-disappear from the educational pipeline before graduating from high school. According to a study released by The Civil Rights Project at Harvard University (CRP) and the Urban Institute in 2004, only about 68% of all students nationally who enter 9th grade will graduate &quot;on time&quot; with regular diplomas in 12th grade. While the graduation rate for White students is 75%, only approximately half of Black, Latino, and Native American students earn regular diplomas alongside their classmates. Graduation rates are even lower for minority males. Yet, because of misleading and inaccurate reporting of dropout and graduation rates, and an exclusive preoccupation with testing data, the public remains largely unaware of this educational and civil rights crisis. This report gives special attention to five southern states--Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and North Carolina. These states report graduation rates in 2002 ranging from a high of 85% in North Carolina to a low of 61.8% in Georgia. When a more accurate measurement, the Cumulative Promotion Index (CPI) was used, the graduation rates for these five states dipped far lower than these official estimates. In keeping with the national trend, graduation rates for Black and Latino students in these five states are substantially lower still. In Georgia, which has a substantial and growing Latino population, the rates for Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans were all below 50%. (Contains 40 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Expanded schooling options for disadvantaged children is one of the four major principles of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), representing the theory that competition will produce better educational opportunities for disadvantaged students and improve the performance of low-performing schools. Under NCLB, school choice is the first in a series of sanctions that are applied to schools failing to meet a state's adequate yearly progress (AYP) goals, which are based on students reading and math scores for a given year. These low-performing schools are then required to offer their students the option to transfer to another public school that did make adequate yearly progress. With any new reform, it is important to understand the policy mechanisms that have been put in to achieve its stated goal. To understand whether the NCLB transfer policy improved educational options for low-income and minority students, the implementation of public school choice in ten urban districts-Mesa Public Schools and Washington Elementary District Schools, AZ, Fresno Unified School District and Los Angeles Unified School District, CA, Chicago Public Schools, IL, Buffalo Public Schools and New York City Public Schools, NY, Richmond Public Schools, VA, and Atlanta Public Schools and DeKalb County Schools, GA, were examined. This geographically, politically, and demographically diverse sample of districts provides a range of local contexts for studying the implementation of the NCLB transfer options. This report is organized into three major sections. First, the number of students who requested transfers and were offered the opportunity to move to a different school was examined. Second, the actual schooling options available to students attending schools that were required to offer choice were explored. Third, the constraints districts faced in complying with the regulations governing the NCLB transfer option were analyzed.

        "author":["Orfield, Gary"],
        "description":"The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) is the most significant and controversial change in federal education policy since the federal government assumed a major role in American education almost four decades ago. In many ways, it is the most startling departure in federal educational policy in American history. It is hard to imagine that there are many Americans who do not share its aspirations--to provide better, more demanding education to all students and to have all groups of students in every school move steadily toward a high level of achievement. A number of the specific goals are equally compelling--improving early reading instruction, upgrading the quality of teachers in high poverty schools, providing information for accountability and improvement, and setting the goal that all groups of disadvantaged students make substantial progress every year in every school. Few could disagree with the idea that students in seriously failing schools should have an opportunity to go somewhere else or that it would be good for low-income parents to have resources to supplement their children's education. The authors interest in NCLB is very similar to the interest often expressed by President Bush. Researchers believe that no child should be left behind, as millions have been, that there should be high expectations of children, that resegregation of schools raises the already high stakes of equalizing school opportunity, and that educators should be held responsible for assuring progress for all racial and ethnic subgroups of students. The authors are in favor of good assessments that measure progress and accountability for results. Since the research starts from the perspective of children and minority communities rather than from the perspective of the school systems, the unions, the political parties, or other interests, the authors are not at all reluctant to support major changes if they work. Their central concerns are about racial and ethnic equity. Understanding the impact of NCLB on minority children and schools drove their selection of states and districts--they wanted to know how it worked in states with quite different educational systems and policies but with substantial minority enrollments.

Although both Title I and Title III of NCLB apply to LEP students, this brief focuses on the accountability provisions outlined in Title I, which have generated the most controversy. The brief is divided into three sections. The first section summarizes the NCLB Title I accountability requirements that specifically affect LEP students. The next section answers commonly asked questions about the legislation and LEP students. A final section defines issues that need to be considered as the conversation about NCLB and LEP students continues.",

Thanks to the cooperation of two urban school districts in Fresno, California and Richmond, Virginia, the authors obtained survey responses from two groups of teachers on opposite ends of the country. These two school districts serve many low-income and minority students, with one serving mostly Latino students and the other mostly African-American students, and each operates within a very different state policy and reform context. The response rate of the teachers to the survey was 77.4%. The survey was administered in May-June 2004.",

        "description":"In an increasingly competitive global economy, the consequences of dropping out of high school are devastating to individuals, communities and our national economy. At an absolute minimum, adults need a high school diploma if they are to have any reasonable opportunities to earn a living wage. A community where many parents are dropouts is unlikely to have stable families or social structures. Most businesses need workers with technical skills that require at least a high school diploma. Yet, with little notice, the United States is allowing a dangerously high percentage of students to disappear from the educational pipeline before graduating from high school. Nationally, high school graduation rates are low for all students, with only an estimated 68% of those who enter 9th grade graduating with a regular diploma in 12th grade. According to the calculations used in this report, in 2001, only 50% of all black students, 51% of Native American students, and 53% of all Hispanic students graduated from high school. Black, Native American, and Hispanic males fare even worse: 43%, 47%, and 48% respectively. This report seeks to highlight these disparities to draw the public's and policymakers'  attention to the urgent need to address this educational and civil rights crisis. Appended are: (1) State Profiles; (2) Methodology and Results of 50 State Survey of Graduation Rate Accountability; (3) Definitions of Terms; (4) National and State Graduation Rates; and (5) Promoting Power.

        "description":"A third of a century ago the schools of the South became the most integrated in the nation, a stunning reversal of a long history of educational apartheid written into the state laws and constitutions of the eleven states of the Confederacy and the six Border states, stretching from Oklahoma to Delaware, all of which had legally imposed de jure segregation until the Supreme Court prohibited it in 1954. From being almost completely segregated in their own schools, more than two-fifths of black students in the South were attending majority white schools and many more were in schools with significant diversity at the height of integration. Reversing the historic pattern, almost all of the Southern and Border states became more  integrated than most Northern states with significant black enrollment. Since the 1980s, the tremendous progress in the South has been slowly eroding year by year as black students and the exploding population of Latino students become more isolated from white students. In some of the states which were most successful in achieving integration, the reversal has been much more rapid. Data from this report are computed from the Common Core of Data of the National Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education for the years 1991 and 2003. Earlier data come from the data collected by the Office for Civil Rights. The following is appended: (1) Selected Unitary Status Rulings between 1990-2002. (Contains 7 tables and 2 figures.)",

Despite decades of policy efforts to desegregate Boston, racial segregation has persistently dominated residential patterns in the Boston metropolitan area, and, because it is so linked to inequality of schools and communities, minority children tend to be particularly disadvantaged by the persistence of this form of social stratification. Given existing research that has already established inequities in K-12 education, the purpose of the study described in this report is to examine the potential impact of geographic origin within the Boston metropolitan area on postsecondary access-oriented outcomes such as SAT scores and number and types of applications to postsecondary institutions. More directly, this study provides a descriptive picture of how students from different types of geographic environments in the greater Boston metropolitan area and of different racial and ethnic backgrounds experience opportunities for postsecondary educational access. The authors find that pathways to college are strongly related to residential segregation even after other factors such as income are taken into account. (Contains 14 tables and 10 figures.)",

Given the demographic trends and the high fragmentation that characterizes the metropolitan area, students are most segregated in regions where they are highly concentrated: black students in Boston, Latino and Asian students in certain satellite cities, and white students in the suburbs. The segregation is not just by race or ethnicity but is increasingly by language. High levels of segregation are also very dramatically linked to social and economic differences, proportion of credentialed teachers, and to differences in schooling outcomes such as MCAS scores and completion rates. Segregated minority schools are markedly less successful in terms of academic achievement as measured by the state's mandated tests.

What used to be unusual has now become a necessity if young people are to have a secure life in the middle class in a post-industrial economy. As such, one basic goal of higher education policy should be to make certain that this opportunity is not foreclosed by a family's income or wealth. In a society where 40 percent of students are non-White, it is more important than ever to be sure that minority students can go to college. In a society that does not believe in welfare or social supports, and where fairness rests on supposedly equal access to the education needed for economic success, these should be basic principles. In a society where the cost of college is soaring, affordability is a basic dimension of fairness. Unfortunately, it is being lost in too many state policy changes.

        "description":"The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) teacher quality provisions recognize both the importance of teacher quality for improving student achievement and the unequal distribution of teachers across districts and schools. But the question of how to achieve the goal of a high quality teacher in every classroom is complicated because of the challenges of attracting and retaining teachers to schools serving large numbers of minority and low-income students, the schools most likely to have the least qualified teachers. Professional development, the primary mechanism in the law to improve teacher quality, is insufficient to overcome these challenges and insure a high quality teacher in every classroom. Moreover, the sanctions attached to the NCLB adequate yearly progress requirements create an additional disincentive for highly qualified teachers to remain in high-poverty schools. This report examines the challenges of implementing the NCLB teacher quality provisions in six states-Arizona, California, Illinois, New York, Georgia, and Virginia-and eleven school districts. The authors examine how teacher quality varies by school characteristics, how each state's policy context affects teacher policies, and the barriers to implementing the NCLB teacher quality requirements at the state and local level using both qualitative and quantitative data sources.

Examples from research into teaching reveal factors in complexity and ways in which inquiry between teachers and didacticians can foster deeper ways of knowing in the developmental community. Research is seen as the basis of an inquiry process which develops inquiry in mathematics teaching as both a tool for teaching and a way of being for all learners. Theoretical discussion on the concepts of inquiry and community and their relation to development leads to consideration of approaches in which mathematics teaching development is the object of a design process. Tensions between learning theory and proposals for developmental practice are revealed and addressed. Research that is designed to create and study inquiry communities is introduced.

It has several basic goals--to help people understand some of the mechanisms of educational inequality by looking at segregation of schools and students by poverty, discussing the massive research literature showing the ways in which high poverty schools are systematically unequal, and then exploring the racial consequences of the fact that concentrated poverty schools have a vastly larger impact on black and Latino students than on their white and Asian counterparts. Another basic goal of the paper is to show how different relationships between race and poverty in differing parts of a nation in rapid demographic transition challenge the traditional black-white description of segregation. Unlike earlier studies, this one gives central attention to the issue of segregation by poverty and shows how it relates to racial inequality. (Contains 28 tables and 64 endnotes.)",

        "description":"In my contribution to this panel I will bring elements from recent research I  conducted (Santos, 2004) in Cape Verde aiming to clarify the meaning of learning as participation in social practices--&quot;learning as participation in the social world&quot;  (Lave and Wenger, 1991, p. 42). But as my main interest is learning in compulsory  education (in Portugal until 9th grade) I looked for an empirical field that allowed me to describe the practice developed by one group of young people involved in activities that are not seen (by the youngsters and by the social world around them as a suitable profession for adults. The object of study was the participation of youngsters in an activity that they approached as something that allows them to fulfill immediate needs and not seen as a way of getting &quot;a job&quot;. In this sense, the activity was not connected to any sense of &quot;becoming&quot; a certain kind of person. I identified a group of youngsters in Praia (the capital of Cape Verde) within a practice--selling newspapers in the street. The boys involved in this practice are called ardinas. For me--a mathematics teacher looking for a deeper  understanding of the learning of mathematics in compulsory education--the mathematics-in-use was the &quot;natural&quot; entry point to make sense of the practice and to identify the learning emerging from ardinas' participation.

These are children who for various reasons have left home, eke out a living on the streets of a city--referred to as &quot;street children&quot;, and are often placed in &quot;shelters&quot; and &quot;homes&quot; (Chetty, 1997). I refer to research conducted related to providing mathematics education for such learners, to address firstly, the question of how such children come to engage particular experiences of mathematics education and secondly, the challenges and consequences of doing such research. The story I tell to respond to the theme of this panel--working for inclusion and diversity in mathematics education--is that of Nellie and Wiseman as researched and documented by Sheena Rughubar (2003), but I also reflect on broader issues of doing research and its processes and relations that involves working outside mainstream schooling and on working with research students in such settings.

        "description":"The presentations address a variety of difficulties occurring in students' solutions of  equations and inequalities, and suggest different reasons for these difficulties. When analyzing students' performances, [BB] and [TTT] mention students' tendencies to make irrelevant connections between equations and inequalities as a problematic phenomenon. It should be noted, however, that [K] presents connections made between equations and inequalities as an important step in solving algebraic problems by means of non-algebraic methods. [BB] mention traditional, algorithmic teaching approaches as a main reason for students' errors, Dreyfus and Hoch [DH] mention the need to enhance the internal structure of equations that students hold, while [S] carefully analyzes difficulties with reference to the various solving methods and indicates that even the functional approach and the use of graphic calculators do not automatically lead to errorless solutions. However, beyond their differences, the presentations share common goals. One such goal is to investigate ways to promote performance on algebraic equations and  inequalities by seeking means for analyzing students' reactions to various  representations of equations and inequalities in different contexts, while considering the way this topic was taught. Thus, this forum will also shed light on the more general issues concerning the interplay between theory, research and instruction.

        "author":["Koppich, Julia E."],
        "description":"If recent efforts to raise student achievement are to succeed, all school children must have access to highly skilled teachers. Research increasingly demonstrates that teachers are critical influences on student learning. In addition to discussion of how to produce an adequate supply of teachers with the requisite skills, research reveals much about the qualities of effective teachers. Good teachers know their subjects deeply and understand how to teach them. They understand how standards, curriculum, and assessments interact and how to use these in their classrooms. They know how to diagnose student learning and adapt instructional approaches to meet student needs. And, they know how to adapt to ever-changing classroom situations. The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as No Child Left Behind added a number of important new components to the federal law and to requirements for teacher qualifications. Among these is the requirement that all teachers of core academic subjects (including elementary grades) be &quot;highly qualified&quot; by the 2005-2006 school year. The law lists as core subjects English, reading/language arts, mathematics, science, foreign language, civics and government, economics, the arts, history, and geography. This Issue Brief offers advice to governors as they seek to shape their states' policies to meet the letter and spirit of the federal law. The brief suggests five policy strategies designed to promote high quality teacher preparation programs and licensing standards: (1) Establish standards of good teaching; (2) Require a blend of subject matter and pedagogical preparation; (3) Require a period of induction under the supervision of a mentor teacher; (4) Develop a system of performance-based licensing; and (5) Promote incentives to recruit and retain teachers.

High school success is more important than ever for the health of our economy, for civic life, and to ensure equal opportunity. Unfortunately, the quality of state high school graduation and dropout data is such that most states cannot accurately account for their students as they progress through high school. Until recently, many states had not collected both graduation and dropout data, and those that have collected these data have not generally obtained accurate information. Therefore, as education reform efforts  increasingly focus on high schools, the quality of graduation and dropout data becomes even more critical. The National Governors Association, under the leadership of NGA Chair Governor Mark R. Warner of Virginia, convened a Task Force on State High School Graduation Data to make recommendations about how states can develop a high-quality, comparable high school graduation measure, as well as complementary indicators of student progress and outcomes and data systems capable of collecting, analyzing, and reporting the data states need. The task force members found substantial consensus on which to build their findings and recommendations. (Contains 21 endnotes.)",

The 2005 National Education Summit on High Schools, cohosted by the National Governors Association (NGA) and Achieve, Inc., unveiled \"An Action Agenda for Improving America's High Schools\" to help governors address this problem. One of the \"Action Agenda's\" recommendations is to improve statewide education leadership and governance. Currently, statewide education governance is fragmented. In almost every state, state boards and agencies for K-12 and postsecondary education operate independently and are not held accountable for common goals or education outcomes. Most states also lack a way to coordinate policies for high schools with those for public two- and four-year postsecondary institutions. Consequently, high school students, their parents, and educators receive conflicting and vague messages about what students need to know and be able to do to transition to the next education level. Governors can pursue three strategies to improve statewide education leadership and governance: (1) Create a single governance system for kindergarten (or early childhood) through postsecondary education; (2)  Create a permanent statewide education commission; and (3) Strengthen statewide governance or coordination of higher education.

        "description":"Although states have maintained a focus on recruiting and retaining teachers, many schools and districts still face daunting challenges in ensuring a qualified and competent teaching corps. It is particularly difficult for schools considered hard to staff-those with high concentrations of low-performing, low-income students; high teacher turnover; and relatively high percentages of teachers who are less than fully certified. States are experimenting with numerous strategies for recruiting and retaining teachers, and some of them are trying particularly to help hard-to-staff schools. To date, there is little hard evidence of the impact of many of their efforts. However, some practices appear promising. To help meet the needs of chronically hard-to-staff schools, governors should consider short-and long-term efforts to: (1) Evaluate and assess current strategies by collecting, analyzing, and using better data; (2) Offer a flexible package of financial incentives to meet different local needs, possibly including substantial changes to traditional pay structures; (3) Track, analyze, and improve teacher working conditions, including ensuring strong school leadership, time for teachers to develop their teaching craft, and sufficient materials and resources to teach effectively; and (4) Improve preparation and support for beginning teachers.

        "description":"State policy leaders are concerned that the current supply of schools is not successfully educating all students to meet achievement goals set by the state. States have identified approximately 20,000 schools that did not meet expectations for adequate yearly progress and more than 11,000 schools that failed to meet adequate yearly progress targets for two consecutive years. Increasingly, policy leaders are concluding that providing quality education options can raise student achievement and improve existing schools. Governors are looking to maximize public investment in education. They want to ensure that students attend schools that meet their learning needs and that more students graduate from high school ready for success in postsecondary education and the workplace. Given the slow pace of achievement and graduation rate improvements, many policymakers have decided that providing assistance to existing schools and assessing the results of their work with students are not enough. These policymakers have begun giving families and students greater choice in education options. They believe different education options can help meet the goals of improved student achievement and higher graduation rates, meet No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requirements to offer choice options, encourage innovation and improvement across the education system, satisfy parental demands for options, and reduce segregation by race and income.

        "title":"Reading to Achieve: A Governor's Guide to Adolescent Literacy",
        "description":"To compete in the global information economy, young people today need literacy skills far more advanced than have been required of any previous generation. Strong reading, writing, and thinking skills are essential not only for success in school and the workplace, but also for participation in civic life. Yet many youth lack the requisite literacy skills. Only three out of 10 U.S. eighth-graders are proficient readers. Poor readers in elementary and middle school are likely to struggle in high school and are most at risk of dropping out before graduation. Even many high school graduates are unprepared to meet the literacy expectations of their professors or employers. Opportunities for economic success will increasingly require that young people possess strong literacy skills. Nearly two-thirds of new jobs in this decade will require some postsecondary education, and the fastest-growing jobs make the highest literacy and education demands. Unfortunately, for too many students, literacy instruction ends in third grade. The nation's eight million struggling readers who are adolescents--defined in this guide as students in grades four through 12--also need extra support. A state commitment to providing literacy instruction to students from kindergarten through 12th grade is necessary for governors to meet adequate yearly progress targets, raise high school graduation rates, increase the value of the high school diploma, and close the achievement gap. This document is organized into the following sections: (1) Why Focus on Adolescent Literacy; (2) Why Adolescent Literacy Is Hard to Define and Address; (3) What Governors and States Can Do to Improve Adolescent Literacy; and (4) Conclusion. The following are appended: (1) Resources on Adolescent Literacy; (2) Examples of Promising Practices; (3) Contacts for More Information on Promising Practices; and (4) Potential Funding Sources for Adolescent Literacy.

        "description":"Extra learning opportunities (ELOs) help to ensure that children are successful in school and in life. Although before- and after-school programs have been around for decades,  much is being learned about how the hours outside of school can be critical determinants of student achievement. With many forms and purposes, extra learning opportunities are a key part of many state policy efforts to support the long-term success of children, families, and communities. State policymakers increasingly recognize the important contributions that high-quality extra learning opportunities can make toward education, youth development, workforce, and prevention priorities. Extra learning opportunities help to keep youth engaged in their schools and communities from an early age. They provide safe havens, promote positive development, and offer additional academic assistance and enrichment to students who require it. ELOs can play a crucial role in state policy efforts to improve schools, help youth develop essential workforce skills, and support families and communities. For example, high-quality ELOs can be an important strategy to close the achievement gap in reading and math. Research also points to the impact of ELOs on outcomes that indirectly affect school achievement: positive social behaviors and attitudes, improved engagement in learning, and development of skills such as problem solving or higher-order thinking.

In the public sector, 598 high schools, 15 comprehensive area vocational-technical schools, 35 charter schools, four consortium-operated alternative high schools and the Scotland School for Veterans Children were surveyed. These public schools had 123,473 graduates. In the private and nonpublic sector, there were 391 high schools with 17,580 graduates. The total number of public, private and nonpublic graduates was 141,053. For the public schools, the data collection used an individual student report via a web-based system, the Electronic Dropout/Graduate Report (EDGR). For the private and nonpublic schools, the data collection continued to be an aggregate report using a paper form. Appended are: (1) Special Populations of Public High School Graduates, 2003-04; (2) Public High School Graduates by Race, Gender and Post-High School Activity, 2003-04; (3) Private and Nonpublic High School Graduates by Race, Gender and Post-High School Activity, 2003-04; (4) Public High School Graduates by Post-High School Activity and County, 2003-04; (5) Private and Nonpublic High School Graduates by Post-High School Activity and County, 2003-04; (6) Glossary; and (7) Sources.

        "description":"Since their inception, charter schools have been controversial. Because they often operate outside the direct control of school boards, superintendents and teachers unions, these entities usually view charter schools skeptically. The funding of charter schools also has provoked discomfort among these entities because they feel money is unfairly lost to charter schools when a student transfers from a non-charter public school to a charter public school. Lastly, although research about the academic performance of charter schools is emerging, a consensus on what the results mean remains elusive. Without that consensus, the debate about the effectiveness of charter schools is contentious. The type of entities that may authorize charter schools varies from state to state. During the 2004-05 school year, there were over 800 charter school authorizers across the country. The vast majority-over 700-were local school boards. The rest were non-local school board authorizers, i.e., \"alternative authorizers.\" Of the over 100 alternative authorizers, 44 were regional educational entities; 37 were universities and colleges; 22 were state boards, commissioners and departments of education; 17 were nonprofit organizations; five were independent special-purpose charter boards; and two were mayors and city councils. Appendix A contains information about which entities may authorize charter schools in each state. This paper's purpose is to help state policymakers think through what kind of alternative authorizing structures may make sense for their states. The paper presents the advantages, disadvantages and policy considerations for each of the seven types of alternative authorizers. In addition, it discusses the critical design issues facing states interested in creating alternative authorizers. (Contains 12 endnotes.)

The focus of this  report is on teacher recruitment and retention. This report is intended to guide policymakers, educators and foundation officials in their efforts to improve the quality and supply of America's teacher workforce. This report, as a starting point, presents an assessment of the current baseline of the research knowledge relating to specific questions about teacher recruitment and retention. The report is structured around the discussion of eight questions, each of which can be read independently of the others. The discussion of each question allows for both a quick summary reading (in the section called Quick Answer) and a more in-depth exploration. A Summary of Studies provides an overview of the key findings and conclusions related to each question.

        "description":"This year, Americans celebrate and reflect on the 40th anniversary of the 1965 Voting  Rights Act that secured the right to vote for millions of disenfranchised African Americans, as well as the 50th anniversary of the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, where Rosa Parks stood up for justice by sitting down on a bus, thus catalyzing the Civil  Rights Movement. This year Americans also honor and reflect on the 30th anniversary of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, which provided farm workers with the right to  organize in California, as well as the 40th anniversary of the Delano Grape Strike, which catapulted Cesar Chavez and the Farm Worker Movement onto the national scene.  As Americans celebrate, honor and reflect on these historic milestones, it is particularly important that the work and the lives of the champions of these movements- Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar E. Chavez-are seen as enduring and relevant inspirations   today. As a sign of the two men's legacies, more than 200 public schools and  500 streets throughout the country are named after one or both men. But the lasting influence of these men, particularly regarding the civic mission of schools, extends well beyond the naming of schools and streets across the country. To demonstrate that influence, this paper explores the following three topics: (1) Lessons from the work of King and Chavez that can help educators and policymakers think more deeply about ways in which awareness and advocacy can be strengthened to support the civic mission of schools; (2) Specific examples of ways in which schools are using the King and Chavez legacies; and (3) Specific recommendations for policymakers that use the King and Chavez legacies to create opportunities for effective civic education in America?s schools. Four lessons stand out in the work of both Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez that offer useful ways to think about building awareness and advocacy for the civic mission of schools. They are (1 of dership; (2) The Importance of a Strategic Agenda; (3) The Importance of Policy; and (4) The Importance of Alliances with the Business Community. Through this paper, the authors hope every educator and policymaker in the country will reconnect to the power of the King and Chavez legacies and learn about strategies and options that can ensure today's young people build upon these great heritages.",

        "author":["Weiss, Suzanne, Ed."],
        "description":"Opportunities to earn college credit in high school, once limited to a few programs available only to a small percentage of students, have grown dramatically over the last decade. More and more states are adopting policies designed to create a wider array of opportunities--for a broader range of students--to get a head start on college. These opportunities range from \"college-like\" Advanced Placement courses that traditionally have been used to accelerate the progress of high-achieving 11th and 12th graders; to programs that allow students to take actual college courses, for credit, while still enrolled in high school; to innovative new options for a broader range of students--from tech-prep programs to distance learning to early and middle college high schools. Dual enrollment exists in some form or other, in nearly every state--18 states mandate that dual enrollment opportunities be provided to students. But eligibility and tuition requirements, funding streams and program features vary widely from state to state. Courses may or may not be designed specifically for high school students; they may be offered at the high school or at the college; they may be taught by regular college faculty or by specifically certified high school teachers. Some programs offer college credit immediately upon completion of the course, while others offer the credit only when the student enrolls in postsecondary education. This issue of \"The Progress of Education Reform\" summarizes the findings of three reports: (1) A review of existing research on the effectiveness of dual enrollment programs in increasing college access and success for a broad range of students; (2) An in-depth look at state dual enrollment policies, and how they affect the quality and availability of programs; and (3) An analysis of differing views within the higher education community on the role and value of college-level learning in high school--Advanced Placement courses and school- and college-based dual enrollment programs. The titles of the three reports summarized are: (1) \"State Dual Enrollment Policies: Addressing Access and Quality\" (Office of Vocational and Adult Education, U.S. Department of Education, September 2004); (2) \"Promoting College Access and Success: A Review of Credit-Based Transition Programs\" (Office of Vocational and Adult Education, U.S. Department of Education, November 2003); and (3) \"College-Level Learning in High School: Purposes, Policies and Practical Implications\" (D.

        "description":"Opportunities for children and youth to engage in activities during out-of-school hours come in various shapes, sizes and flavors. At one end of the spectrum are highly structured, five-day-a-week, school-based programs focused broadly on encouraging and supporting academic and social development. At the other end are assorted activities and services available on a less regular basis and/or designed around specific needs, interests and priorities--ranging from providing tutoring and homework help for struggling students to reducing delinquency, substance abuse and other problem behaviors. In recent years, there has been an upsurge in the number of after-school options available to students, with public schools taking the lead role in developing such programs--typically in collaboration with community youth-service agencies. The federal government has gotten into the business of supporting after-school programs, too, especially in low-income communities. Funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, an after-school program established by the Clinton administration, has increased dramatically over the years, from $1 million in 1997 to nearly $1 billion last year. Clearly, well-structured and comprehensive after-school programming is increasingly viewed as a unique and essential component of efforts to promote learning and social development for children of all backgrounds. But despite its rapid growth, enormous appeal and clear potential, the after-school movement so far lacks a solid basis for decision-making in areas ranging from program design to funding to the nature and extent of demand for programs and services. This issue of \"The Progress of Education Reform\" summarizes three recent reports on after-school programs. The three reports that are reviewed include: (1) \"Critical Hours: Afterschool Programs and Educational Success\" (Nellie Mae Education Foundation, May 2003); (2) \"All Work and No Play? Listening to What Kids and Parents Really Want from Out-of-School Time\" (Public Agenda, November 2004); and (3) \"Making Out-of-School Time Matter: Evidence for an Action Agenda\" (RAND Corp., June 2005).

        "author":["DiBiase, Rebecca Wolf"],
        "description":"No Child Left Behind (NCLB) was passed with a promise to &quot;change the culture of America's schools.&quot; A focus on accountability for results is among its main vehicles  for transformation, including the requirement that significant action be taken in schools and districts that continue to underperform academically. Toward that end, NCLB requires that if a school does not make adequate yearly progress (AYP) for five consecutive years, its district must create a plan to restructure the school. If the school does not make AYP for six consecutive years, its district must implement this plan. The language of the legislation places the burden of restructuring on the local education agency (LEA), which is normally the local district. But ultimate accountability for the implementation of the legislation is given to the state education agency (SEA)-i.e., the state department of education. Ambiguity remains, though, regarding the respective roles of LEAs and SEAs. As a result, each SEA has interpreted its role in school restructuring differently. To gain a better understanding of these differing interpretations, this paper examines how state departments of education have been involved in the planning and implementation of school restructuring under NCLB. The experience of these states can serve as a baseline to understand how the restructuring process works in practice and how it may evolve in the future. The information in this document is based on interviews with state officials as well as reviews of relevant documents.

Equally important, such programs ensure the district has a recognized leadership pipeline and a continuous supply of leaders from the ranks of those who are familiar with the district and its particular challenges. One program that has had remarkable success with the homegrown approach is the First Ring Leadership Academy. Established in 2003, the academy serves 13 school districts surrounding the city of Cleveland, Ohio. The mission of the First Ring Leadership Academy is to recruit, train and retain school leaders capable  of meeting challenges unique to First Ring school districts to increase the region's capacity for educational leadership and school reform.

        "author":["Ashby, Cornelia M."],
        "description":"Under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and the Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP), the government guarantees and makes consolidation loans to help borrowers manage their student loan debt. By combining loans into one and extending repayment, monthly repayments are reduced. Unlike other student loans, consolidation loans carry a fixed interest rate. Recently, trends in interest rates and consolidation loan volume have increased overall federal costs, leading Congress to consider cost reduction proposals. Under the Federal Credit Reform Act, the government calculates, for budgetary purposes, the net cost, or &quot;subsidy cost,&quot; of extending or guaranteeing credit over the life of loans. GAO was asked to provide information on the budgetary effects of making consolidation loans exclusively through FDLP. Providing consolidation loans exclusively through FDLP in fiscal year 2006 could yield estimated budgetary cost savings of about $3.1 billion, based on subsidy cost estimates in the President's fiscal year 2006 budget. However, actual savings would remain unknown until all loans made in fiscal year 2006 are repaid and actual interest rates over the life of the loans are known. The estimated savings could change substantially as future reestimates of subsidy costs incorporate actual results as well as reflect changes in key assumptions about the future, such as interest rates, loan performance, and loan volume. The actual impact on lenders and borrowers is difficult to predict. However, according to lenders, consolidating all loans through FDLP would reduce lender revenue and certain borrower benefits provided by FFELP lenders. Briefing slides are contained in the appendix.

These data were collected through the IPEDS web-based data collection system. Tabulations in this report present selected data items collected from, or imputed for, the 6,374 Title IV institutions in the United States that are eligible for at least one component of the Winter 2004-05 data collection. Data for the 165 institutions located in other jurisdictions, such as Puerto Rico, are not included in the tabulations in this report. Institutions provided data about faculty and staff employed at Title IV participating institutions in the United States as well as salaries and fringe benefits of those full-time instructional faculty at Title IV degree-granting institutions in the United States. Degree-granting institutions are those offering associate's, bachelor's, master's, doctor's, and first-professional degrees. The information presented about salaries and fringe benefits have been adjusted. Total salary outlays for full-time faculty (by rank) on 11/12-month contracts were adjusted to 9/10-month outlays by multiplying the outlay for 11/12-month contracted faculty by 0.8182. The &quot;equated&quot; outlays were then added to the outlays for 9/10-month faculty to determine an average salary for each rank.

        "description":"In developing the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), a special effort was made to include questions that would help determine the extent to which the characteristics of professional development policies and practices were consistent with the emerging consensus on the key features of professional development as described by Hawley and Valli (2001). The survey addressed how professional development was organized and managed, what kinds of activities were available to teachers, and which ones they participated in. This report uses these data to describe what district staff, principals, and teachers reported about these important aspects of teacher professional development. The SASS data cannot be used to address questions on whether these aspects actually improve the effectiveness of teacher professional development activities (i.e., questions regarding associations between particular professional development activities and student outcomes). Major topics covered by this report include planning and implementation of professional development, selection and evaluation of professional development activities, support for teacher professional development, professional development topics, and usefulness of professional development activities. Some of the findings of this study include: (1) According to district staff, primary responsibility for deciding the content of professional development activities, designing and planning activities, and conducting activities rests most commonly with district staff or principals rather than teachers or outside providers; (2) Outside providers play a larger role in conducting activities than they do at the earlier stages (i.e., deciding the content, deciding and planning the activities); (3) Most public school principals reported that they (83 percent), teachers (78 percent), and district staff (73 percent) had &quot;a great deal of influence&quot; in determining the content of in-service activities; (4) Boards has similar amounts of influence in both public and private sectors; (5) At the elementary level, teachers' likelihood of reporting that teachers in their school had &quot;a great deal of influence in determining the content of in-service activities&quot; decreased as school size increased; and (6) Between 81 and 89 percent of public school principals reported that district-level initiatives and improvement plans, school improvement plans, and implementation of academic or skills standards were &quot;very important&quot; determinants of professional development activities for teachers.

Much of this pressure is based on the idea that clear expectations, combined with sanctions for poor performance, will motivate educators and students to try harder and do better. The federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is the most comprehensive expression of this pressure. NCLB sets performance targets that schools and districts must meet--referred to as &quot;Adequate Yearly Progress&quot; (AYP). NCLB also outlines a series of escalating consequences for not meeting AYP targets. This document presents a table that documents the 2004 AYP results for schools in the Philadelphia area, broken down into sections representing elementary schools, K-4 schools, middle schools, high schools, charter schools, and disciplinary and special schools.

The authors argue that the story of Philadelphia's diverse provider model is not an account of market competition and school choice. Instead, it is an account of how the outsourcing of educational management functions has led to the development of a &quot;cross-sectoral collaboration&quot; between Philadelphia's public schools and a set of diverse providers. In this relationship, the district itself is positioned as the consumer of educational services as it strives to accelerate performance in low-performing schools and to take reforms to scale.

Further, these and other organizations also receive contracts to provide a range of additional services. The shift to a public/private institutional structure, coupled with the urgency surrounding urban school reform, together shape civic and community engagement in decisions affecting public education. This investigation contributes to research that has established the importance of &quot;civic capacity&quot;--defined as broad-based engagement of civic and community groups in identifying and pursuing an agenda for school improvement--to urban school reform. The literature on civic capacity has focused on political and economic dynamics at the city-wide level. This report focuses on the structure of school district governance as an important aspect of the context influencing civic capacity. In this brief, the authors focus specifically on neighborhood-based organizations and advocacy groups with limited resources. Contractual relationships may be making it difficult for these groups--so often important voices for equity and sustainability in the city--to take an independent stance from the school district. In addition, the authors argue that the sense of urgency fostered by both the state takeover and NCLB promotes a rapid reform pace, which, in turn, can eclipse meaningful citizen engagement.",

The 2003 Public Opinion Survey on Education in Indiana addresses the following topics: (1) Overall Evaluation of Indiana Public Schools; (2) School Funding; (3) Core 40 and the P-16 Plan; (4) ISTEP+ and State Standards; (5) School Choice; (6) Teacher Quality; and (7) The No Child Left Behind Act and PL221. This report summarizes the findings of the 2003 Public Opinion Survey on Education in Indiana, conducted in late Fall 2003. Results are reported in summary for Indiana overall, and then, for comparison purposes, are shown disaggregated by northern, southern, and central Indiana regions, as well as by demographic categories. Appended are: (1) Summary Tables for Open-ended Questions; and (2) Detailed Results.

As such, if a charter school fails to meet its educational objectives, the charter may be revoked or not renewed. Revocation is the withdrawal of a school's charter during its term, while renewal relates to the decision by a charter-granting authority to enter into a new contract once the term of an existing contract expires. As of fall 2002, 194 charter schools had revoked or non-renewed charters, with these closures occurring in 26 of the 33 states and District of Columbia that had chartered schools up to that time. Although this is slightly less than 7% of the schools that have been granted charters, the number of schools is large enough to warrant careful consideration of charter revocation and non-renewal processes.

To provide some structure for addressing a wide breadth of topics, the report is organized into four sections. Each describes the policy actions taken in 2005 and the ongoing issues that are expected to shape the education debate in 2006. These issues are neither comprehensive nor mutually exclusive. But all reflect the challenges inherent in attempting to create an effective system of public education in which district, state, and federal policies work together to improve the effectiveness of schools and the achievement of students. In California that involves almost 1,000 school districts, over six million children, more than 300,000 educators, and a Legislature and governor who have often been at odds. It is certain that the debates will continue. Clear, effective actions are less of a sure thing.

        "description":"The shift of public policymaking regarding children and families from the federal to the state and local levels has increased demand for measures of child well-being in states and communities. However, it is difficult to obtain reliable data about the well-being of rural children in states or communities. Of 61 key indicators of child well-being, 51 cannot be estimated for rural children using public-use data and a precise definition of rurality. Even using non-public-use data, most of these indicators can only be estimated for rural children under 18 nationally and in some larger states. More should be done to promote the analysis and dissemination of child well-being indicators for rural children. Indeed, with millions of children living in rural areas across the country, more must be done to ensure that public policy anticipates the needs of these children. This is especially important given the extra challenges that long distances pose for services to rural children and their families, and given the greater role that state and local governments play in child and family policy.

Comparisons of rural and non-rural young children in the baseline data of the Kindergarten Cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, with breakdowns for ethnicity and family income, reveal that rural life is associated with some positive indicators for early childhood social-emotional development, such as beginning kindergarteners' social competence, neighborhood safety, and parental coping. Rural life appears to have no relationship to some indicators, such as internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and maternal depression. However, rural life is associated with some social-emotional risk factors, particularly negative parental discipline. Ethnic disparities within the rural subset of the ECLS-K tend to be similar to ethnic disparities in the non-rural subset.

The authors of the agenda called for comparison of health and school readiness indicators in the federal Early Childhood Longitudinal Study for rural and non-rural American Indian and Alaska Native (AI-AN) children, and of the same indicators for rural AI-AN children and other rural children (Strang & Von Glatz, 2001). They indicated that the ECLS was \"the most significant study.... underway\" and predicted that findings concerning Native children would be \"invaluable for Native researchers who seek to untangle the interrelationships among personal characteristics, family background, community, early childhood services, and success in making the transition to school\" (p. 34). \"Comparisons of educational outcomes within the population of American Indian and Alaska Native students may be very useful.

Currently, however, it is unclear the extent to which commonly used measures of well-being can be estimated for children living in rural areas. To investigate this issue, the authors examined a number of large, national data sets that provide source data for well-being indicators. We find that data confidentiality protocols and small sample sizes limit the extent to which child well-being indicators can be estimated for rural children. While public-use data can be used to estimate many indicators of child well-being using the imprecise \"nonmetropolitan\" definition of rural, few indicators can be estimated when rural is defined  more precisely (areas with populations of less than 2,500 residents). Gaining access to non-public-use data increases the number of indicators that can be estimated with the more precise definition of rural, but at substantial monetary and administrative costs. The authors conclude this discussion with suggestions for next steps to promote analysis and dissemination of child well-being indicators for rural young children.

Further, it maintains that diversity and structural backlashes to it in the United States in social and economic life shape and are shaped by crises in mathematics education. Attention is paid to the lack of instructional diversity in mathematical problem types and to the mathematical achievement of African American and Latino middle-school students. The paper further argues for the importance of the category of intellectual agency, an under-theorized and under-researched psychological phenomenon in mathematics education, particularly in the literature on minority-student achievement. The paper concludes with preliminary data to show the promise of this line of inquiry for researching the development of mathematical ideas and forms of reasoning among a diversity of students.

        "description":"Substance use by American young people has proven to be a rapidly-changing phenomenon, requiring frequent assessments and reassessments. Since the mid-1960s it has remained a major concern for the nation. Smoking, drinking, and illicit drug use are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both during adolescence as well as later in life. How vigorously the nation responds to teenage substance use, how accurately it identifies the substance abuse problems that are emerging, and how well it comes to understand the effectiveness of the many policy and intervention efforts largely depend on the ongoing collection of valid and reliable data. Monitoring the Future is designed to help provide an accurate picture of what is happening in this domain and why; and it has served that function for 30 years now. First results from the Monitoring the Future study's 2004 nationwide survey of nearly 50,000 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students are given in this report. Recent trends in the use of licit and illicit drugs are emphasized. Trends in the levels of perceived risk and personal disapproval associated with each drug are also presented; this study has shown these beliefs and attitudes to be particularly important in explaining trends in use. In addition, trends in the perceived availability of each drug are presented. Following a brief introduction, the report presents a synopsis of the methods used in the study and an overview of the key results from the 2004 survey. Next is a section for each individual drug class, providing figures that show trends in the overall proportions of students at each grade level (a) using it, (b) seeing a \"great risk\" associated with its use, (c) disapproving its use, and (d) saying that they could get the drug \"fairly easily\" or \"very easily.\" Trends for the interval 1991-2004 appear for all grades and for 1975-2004 for the 12th graders. The tables at the end of this report provide the statistics underlying the figures; in addition, they present data on lifetime, annual, 30-day, and (for selected drugs) daily prevalence.

        "description":"In 2004 the Monitoring the Future study marked its 30th year of conducting national surveys of substance use among American young people. Beginning with the first survey of high school seniors in 1975, the study has provided the nation with a window through which to view the important, but largely hidden, problem behaviors of illicit drug use, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking. It has thus enabled the nation to gain a better understanding of the changing nature of these problems, as well as some of their causes and consequences. This annual monograph series has been the primary vehicle for disseminating the epidemiological findings from the study. It has grown substantially over the years in both coverage and size, in part because of the proliferation of substances being used. This latest two-volume monograph presents the results of the 30th (2004) national survey of drug use and related attitudes and beliefs among American high school seniors, the 25th such survey of American college students, and the 14th such survey of 8th- and 10th-grade students. Results have also been reported for varying intervals on young adult high school graduates, as well as adult high school graduates into middle age (currently through age 45), who have been followed from high school graduation through a series of panel studies. Appended are: (1) Prevalence and Trend Estimates Adjusted for Absentees and  Dropouts; (2) Definition of Background and Demographic Subgroups; (3) Estimation of Sampling Errors; (4) Trends by Subgroup: Supplemental Tables for Secondary School Students; and (5) Trends in Specific Subclasses of Hallucinogens, Amphetamines, Tranquilizers, and Narcotic Drugs Other Than Heroin.

It also contains findings on attitudes and beliefs about drugs, as well as on several particularly salient dimensions of their social environments. Volume I presents similar findings for American secondary students in grades 8, 10, and 12. One important segment covered here is the population of American college students; a second is their age peers who are not attending college. Also covered in this volume are young adult high  school graduates ages 19 to 30 (including the college students), as well as high school graduates at ages 35, 40, and 45. Monitoring the Future is a long-term research program conducted at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research under a series of investigator-initiated research grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Now in its 30th year, it comprises, in part, ongoing series of annual nationally representative surveys of 12th- (begun in 1975) and of 8th- and 10th-grade students (begun in 1991).

This document is meant to summarize the conference's presentations and discussions. William Peterson, from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), and the IST co-chair, welcomed those assembled. He emphasized that the title of the conference, which was limited only to physical disabilities, was intended to give participants a clear direction and focus. While the ICDR is concerned about issues pertaining to all people with disabilities, Peterson continued, a two-day conference does not allow time to fully explore and develop recommendations for each disability area. Among the 85 presenters and participants were federal employees involved in emergency preparedness; first responders and emergency management personnel; building and life safety code practitioners; manufacturers of evacuation devices; people with disabilities who have used evacuation devices; and leading researchers in mobility devices, human factors and egress modeling.

        "description":"Besides a change in the expectations of parents, other shifts are occurring in society that impact the youngest children (Bowman, Donovan, & Burns, 2000): (1) More women are in the workforce than ever before, which means more children are in child care or preschool; (2) There is increasing evidence of, and conviction from educators, that preschool children should receive some form of educational experience; and (3) There is growing evidence from early childhood research that indicates early childhood education has a positive correlation with school performance. In response to these changes, child care centers and preschools now are emphasizing literacy development. These early years--birth to age 5--are crucial in the physical, emotional, social, and educational (through sight, sound, and memory) development of prereading, language, vocabulary, and number skills (Michigan State Board of Education, 2002). A child?s ability to learn to read and write is linked to age-related development (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998); and speaking, reading, and writing--literacy. The activities in this guide are a good starting point for helping children learn to read and write to prepare them for kindergarten. Any of these activities can be adjusted to fit any family and/or personal schedule. For example, some of these activities can be done while parents and children are driving in the car, riding on a bus, or eating a meal together. Remember that of all of these, the most important is that parents read to their children frequently, even if each time is brief. [This document was published by Learning Point Associates.

        "description":"To what extent can educational technology help schools close achievement gaps?  What types of educational technology can administrators, teachers, and students  use to help close achievement gaps? What kinds of educational technology practices and policies can help schools close achievement gaps?  In order to address these questions, the North Central Regional Educational Laboratory (NCREL) conducted case studies of 19 high-performing, high-technology schools that have predominantly low income, African-American, or Latino student populations. NCREL's case studies were designed to discover characteristics of high-performing, high-technology schools that may contribute to the academic achievement of low income, African-American, and Latino students. Previous studies in both the qualitative and quantitative literature have typically proceeded from a specific technology or use of technology to a consideration of its effects on some measure of student achievement, ranging from instruments designed by teachers or researchers to standardized tests. In contrast, this study proceeds from success on state achievement tests at the school level to a consideration of what technologies successful schools use and how and why they use them. The initial research questions for NCREL's case studies of high-performing, high-technology schools were as follows: (1) What effects on student achievement do administrators and teachers in high-performing, high-technology schools attribute to educational technology?; (2) What effects on student achievement do administrators and teachers in high-performing, high-technology schools attribute to educational technology?; (3) What types of educational technology do administrators, teachers, and students use in high-performing, high-technology schools?; (4) What types of educational technology do administrators, teachers, and students use in high-performing, high-technology schools?; (5) What educational technology practices do administrators high-performing, high-technology schools employ?; (6) What educational technology policies do administrators and teachers in high- performing, high-technology schools implement?; (7) How does the technology capacity of high-performing, high technology schools affect administrator, teacher, and student use of educational technology?; and (8) What resources, strategies, and structures do schools use to become high-performing and high-technology; to what extent are these integrated with other school improvement efforts? The challenging and cohesive learning environment at the case study schools is attributed primarily to affective factors; most frequently to an atmosphere of caring and high academic expectations. However, physical characteristics of the schools support the challenging and cohesive learning environment in general and the use of technology resources particularly within that environment. All of the high-performing, high-technology schools have computers in classrooms and almost all have at least one computer laboratory. Teachers very rarely describe problems with inadequate physical space or inadequate access to computers. [This report was produced by Learning Point Associates.]",

Culturally responsive instruction makes connections with students' backgrounds, interests, and experiences to teach the standards-based curriculum. Learning becomes more meaningful and relevant as teachers draw upon students' prior knowledge (Guthrie & Wigfield, 2000; Raphael, 1986). This paper describes culturally responsive lessons observed in public secondary classrooms in mathematics, physics, biology, social studies, and English. One school was in a rural setting, another was an alternative school housed in a village church, and three were located in urban areas. The objective of this paper is to describe and portray culturally responsive instruction so educators can have a more concrete understanding of the teaching and learning successes in secondary schools in which poverty issues and diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds of students seem to contribute to academic failure.

        "title":"Differentiation Through Flexible Grouping: Successfully Reaching All Readers",
        "author":["Ford, Michael P."],
        "description":"There always has been a problem with grouping practices in reading programs. The complexity of the interaction between readers, texts, and the contexts in which reading takes place often is ignored by educational decisions that suggest that one program, set of materials, instructional technique, or grouping arrangement can address the needs of all students in a classroom. Common sense and personal experiences suggests that one size rarely fits all. A single instructional response to a group of diverse learners often means that the teaching technique will help some while it ignores others. Furthermore, the exclusive use of the single instructional technique over time will magnify that flaw. Flexible grouping emerged as a practice to address these concerns. It acknowledges that all grouping patterns--large groups, small groups, teams, partners, and individuals-- have value because they all offer the reader slightly different experiences with different outcomes. Flexible grouping was defined by Radencich and McKay (1995) as \"grouping that is not static where members of the reading group change frequently\" (p.11). For example students may work with a partner, in a small cooperative or teacher-led group, or with the whole class. The basis for the grouping may be students' interests or needs. Typically, flexible grouping may revolve around a core grade-level selection read by an entire class or around an individual trade-book program. Teachers attempting flexible grouping recognize that reading achievement is a function not only of the text, but also of the conditions that surround the learning situation.

        "description":"The goal of this document is to provide a scheme that may be used by principals, literacy leaders, and school teams to take stock of the literacy health of their school. The assessment may show that the school is fit on most factors, or that a boost is needed in several areas. Most importantly, as with physical fitness, is to determine priorities and a starting place. In terms of literacy fitness, we have emphasized the need to enroll others as equal partners and the importance of making decisions based on data. Lambert (2005) found that principals and teachers in schools with sustained improvement had progressed through three phases of development: instructive, transitional, and high capacity. While the principal takes the lead and demonstrates strength in the instructive phase, the leadership roles of teachers expand as they negotiate the transition phase. In schools with high leadership capacity, the leadership roles of principals and teachers are less distinguishable and more reciprocal. Following an introduction, this document is divided into the following chapters: (1) Make It Personal and Take It Personally (or, You've Decided to Get Fit); (2) Encourage Talking, Then Listen (or, Check Your Pulse); (3) Take Stock of What Is Good (or, Identify Your Strong Points); (4) Prepare Yourself (or, You Don't Run a Marathon on the First Day); (5) Enroll a Literacy Design Team (or, Work Out with Buddies); (6) Promises We Will Keep (or, It's Not Just About Willpower); (7) Setting Annual Goals (or, Set Your Fitness Goals); (8) Structure the Day to Support Literacy Learning (or, Commit Time for Exercise in Your Daily Schedule); (9) Professional Development (or, Maintaining Your Progress); and (10) Family Involvement (or, Enlist the Rest of Your Family in Healthy Options).",

        "author":["Watson, John"],
        "description":"This report explores policies and practices governing online education with a particular focus on policies aiming to provide students with high-quality online learning experiences. The report looks specifically at two areas: state-level policies governing online education, and statewide online programs (i.e., programs created by legislation or by a state-level agency, and/or funded or administered by a state department of education or another state-level agency to provide online learning opportunities across the state). Online learning has developed explosively over the past five years. As of July 2005, 21 states have statewide online learning programs, and cyberschools and/or district-level online programs operate in almost every state. Both statewide programs and cyberschools report rapid growth, with registrations and enrollments typically experiencing double-digit percentage annual increases. Despite the explosive growth, relatively little is known about the programs that conduct online learning. What percentage of students passes the courses they take? What is the quality of their learning experience? How much does it cost to provide online courses, and what are the best methods for paying that cost? Questions like these raise complex issues of policy, practice, and philosophy. While online-learning practitioners have been grappling with such issues for years, state policymakers have moved much more slowly; and the concern raised four years ago by the National Association of State Boards of Education--that online learning developments would outpace the capacity of policymakers to shape these developments in constructive ways--has turned into an increasingly accurate prediction.

        "description":"In the first section of this two part paper, the author provides a very brief theoretical framework for thinking about content-area literacy instruction for ELLs. In the second section, the author asks: What do effective teachers of linguistically diverse students know and do? This question is answered in five parts. Part one focuses on content teachers whose classrooms the author has visited and who teach ELLs. The author highlights their instructional practices that have value for English learners but also focuses on what effective teachers in general have in common with effective teachers of linguistically diverse students. Part two, argues that effective literacy teachers of linguistically diverse students also think about the different meanings of and uses for literacy held by their students. This section focuses on the different meanings and uses for literacy held by many ELL students and what teachers can do to support their students' literacy development. Part three points out that students coming to the United States from other countries may have very different ideas about what literacy is and how schools might address these differences. Part four raises the issue of how important becoming literate in English is for these students and how their families often depend on them to take on very demanding roles. The author makes clear that the stakes are high for these students as they become or fail to become literate in English. Part five discusses the need to challenge ELL students with high quality instruction while at the same time making sure they have opportunities to interact with native English speakers. The author concludes with brief but very specific instructional and curricular recommendations to teachers. [This report was produced by Learning Point Associates.]",

This unprecedented level of investment in educational technology has raised expectations of legislators and the public who are now looking for returns on this investment (Benton, 2002; CEO Forum, 1999, 2000), and therefore are calling for evidence regarding the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of technology in K-12 schools (Ringstaff & Kelley, 2002; Panel on Educational Technology, 1997; Melmed, 1995). While complex factors have influenced the decisions for where, what, and how technology is introduced into the nation's school systems, ultimately, the schools will be held accountable for these investments. How can schools ensure that the promise  technology holds for student achievement is realized? What factors need to be in place to support the effective use of technology? What resources can school districts use to help them plan for technology that will have a positive impact on student achievement, and how can they justify that investment? To answer these questions, educators need to look at the research on technology and student achievement and the contextual factors that affect learning goals. This updated briefing (originally published in 1999),  examines current research perspectives and findings on using technology to improve student achievement.

It starts by proposing a generally accepted definition of at-risk schools and making a case for why it is so important to improve teacher quality in these schools. It then takes the reader through (1) an examination of states' recruitment and retention policies and the extent to which these policies specifically target at-risk schools; (2) an assessment of the rigor of some states' recruitment and retention policies that are intended for at-risk schools; and (3) options for how new policies might be framed or current policies improved to ensure that good teachers are available to all of our children--regardless of their socioeconomic status or what language they speak at home.

In  general, these summaries report on the numbers of ELL students and how well they are performing on statewide measures of achievement--information that fulfills external accountability pressures. This edition of &quot;Policy Issues&quot; has been developed to provide perspectives on how information that is already being collected can be analyzed and reported in ways that support the internal information needs of educational systems. Specifically, by using relatively straightforward approaches to analyzing their data, districts and states can better address and convey answers to the following: (1) What are the background characteristics of the ELL students in the school, district, or state? (2) Are background characteristics of ELL students related to how well they progress academically? and (3) Are particular aspects of the educational program, including how instruction is organized and characteristics of teachers, related to student outcomes?

        "description":"Stepping Stones to Literacy is a tool for elementary school improvement teams to evaluate and strengthen their reading programs. Each Stepping Stone is a guided activity to stimulate reflection and guide systematic inquiry. It is a collaborative, active research approach to evaluation (Levesque & Hinton 2001). The goal is to eliminate the gap between what the school improvement team states it believes about good reading programs and classroom instruction and actual program practices that work well consistently. Each chapter introduces key elements of effective schoolwide reading programs with a brief description of research-based practices. These are followed by action guides, called Stepping Stones, that direct the improvement team's attention to critically evaluate the actual program practices going on in their building. These action guides then include directions for following up on program facets in need of improvement. Whether used in part or whole, as a formal part of improvement planning or an informal reflection guide, \"Stepping Stones\" can help school teams gather information essential both for understanding the gaps in implementation of their reading program and for developing plans that address such gaps. The ultimate goal, no matter which way the tool is used, is to help schools take decisive steps toward strong implementation of scientifically valid programs. The following chapters are included: (1) Schoolwide Reading Programs; (2) Establishing a Self-Study Leadership Team; (3) Describing the Core Program; (4) Instructional Research; (5) Time Management; (6) School Climate; (7) Professional Development; (8) Principal's Supervisory Classroom Observation; (9) Student Assessment; (10) Literacy Learning Environment; (11) School-to-Home Communication to Involve Parents; and (12) Putting It All Together.

        "author":["Phelps, Stephen"],
        "description":"There has been a shift in the field of adolescent literacy in the past 10 years. The focus on cognitive strategy instruction as a way to further the literacy development of adolescents and to \"remediate\" older, struggling readers has been supplemented with an appreciation of sociocultural influences that shape the literacy practices of an increasingly culturally and linguistically diverse student population. At the same time, a focus on new literacies, digital media, and adolescents' in-school and out-of-school literacies has influenced both research and practice. However, many interventions for adolescents are still based primarily on the cognitive model of the past. Energy and resources are often expended to find and implement the \"best\" research-based instructional strategies, but key factors that influence adolescent literacy development are often overlooked. Therefore, this review of 55 research studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 1994 and early 2005 was undertaken to give practitioners guidance in developing teaching strategies and curriculums that will be responsive to the most recent research-based understanding of adolescent literacy. Special attention was given to finding research relevant to students who are often marginalized in secondary content area classes because of ethnicity, language, economic disadvantage, or learning difficulties.

        "description":"The community of K-12 education has seen explosive growth over the last decade in distance learning programs, defined as learning experiences in which students and instructors are separated by space and/or time. While elementary and secondary students have learned through the use of electronic distance learning systems since the 1930s, the development of online distance learning schools is a relatively new phenomenon. Online virtual schools may be ideally suited to meet the needs of stakeholders calling for school choice, high school reform, and workforce preparation in 21st century skills. The growth in the numbers of students learning online and the importance of online learning as a solution to educational challenges has increased the need to study more closely the factors that affect student learning in virtual schooling environments. This meta-analysis is a statistical review of 116 effect sizes from 14 web-delivered K-12 distance education programs studied between 1999 and 2004. The analysis shows that distance education can have the same effect on measures of student academic achievement when compared to traditional instruction. The study-weighted mean effect size across all outcomes was -0.028 with a 95 percent confidence interval from 0.060 to -0.116, indicating no significant difference in performance between students who participated in online programs and those who were taught in face-to-face classrooms. No factors were found to be related to significant positive or negative effects. The factors that were tested included academic content area, grade level of the students, role of the distance learning program, role of the instructor, length of the program, type of school, frequency of the distance learning experience, pacing of instruction, timing of instruction, instructor preparation and experience in distance education, and the setting of the students.

Successful instruction of this type has usually focused on the teaching of comprehension strategies--that is, intentional actions students can use during reading to guide their thinking. Such strategies improve both understanding and memory. Some strategies that have been successfully taught include summarization, questioning, story maps, comprehension monitoring, and graphic organizers; however, the teaching of the combined use of multiple strategies has been most effective in improving reading. Strategy teaching is most effective when it takes a gradual release-of-responsibility approach in which the teacher models the strategy use (\"I do it\"), guides students to use it successfully within reading (\"We do it\"), and then assigns independent practice with the strategy (\"You do it\"). Reading comprehension instruction needs to take place in both narrative and expository text. Appended are (1) Tables; and (2) Resources. [This report was produced by Learning Point Associates.]",

        "description":"Literacy instruction does not end with reading success in early grades. As students move to middle and high school, new challenges emerge that can affect literacy achievement. Even for students who achieve early reading and writing success, the literacy demands of middle and high school can pose substantial challenges. Older students must be able to comprehend more complex texts; determine the meaning of obscure, unfamiliar, and technical vocabulary; use higher-order thinking skills to analyze a wide variety of literacy and expository texts and media; and develop skills for expressing their ideas by writing informative, persuasive, and creative texts. For students who enter middle and high school with compromised reading and writing skills, these challenges are even more daunting. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act promotes significant changes in the nation's schools. This &quot;Quick Key Action Guide&quot; assists educators and administrators in understanding NCLB with a specific focus on the needs of adolescent learners who are building their literacy across content areas. Examples and suggestions are included to assist education stakeholders in the consideration of reform efforts at the school, district, and state levels.",

The teachers in this study were engaged in model-eliciting activities designed to promote the development of their knowledge and reveal their models (or interpretations) of their students' algebraic thinking about equivalent expressions by creating a library of their students' work. This report focuses on one teacher's model of his algebraic practice. Results showed that this teacher devoted a significant amount of time to the implementation of the algebraic unit. The teacher employed visual strategies for the first time and began to perceive their usefulness in demonstrating the equivalency of two expressions. (Contains 2 figures.)

A group of sixth-grade students of elementary education in Mexico participated in the implementation of the proposal. The girl of the case study was representative of those students in the group who had a lot of recourse to handling algorithms mechanically and whose elaborations made no sense at all, according to their answers to an initial questionnaire. A didactical program, developed in a problem-solving context for the research study, helped the girl widen her qualitative thinking and strengthen her quantitative thinking about proportion. Analyses of data collected from an initial questionnaire, the teaching process, a final questionnaire, and three interviews evidenced that enriching this girl's qualitative thinking about proportion allowed her widen quantitative relations and improve her handling of algorithms by providing the setting for meaningful applications.

The students spent the first month working on open-ended geometrical topics. In the second month, working alone or in groups of up to four, they chose one or more of these topics then worked on a problem of their own design. The students spent the class time developing their ideas using strategies such as generating examples and non-examples, generalising, etc. Reference to books was not accepted as a research tool, but the instruction team monitored student progress and was available for questions.

In this paper we compare the performance of three groups: mathematics undergraduates, mathematics staff and history undergraduates (representative of a \"general population\"). These groups were asked to solve Wason's selection task, a seemingly straightforward logical problem. Given the assumption that logic plays a major role in mathematics, the results were surprising: less than a third of students and less than half of staff gave the correct answer. Moreover, mathematicians seem to make different mistakes from the most common mistake noted in the literature. The implications of these results for our understanding of mathematical thought are discussed with reference to the role of error checking. [For complete proceedings, see ED489538.]",

The students used several different kinds of representations to process the derivative. They were all able to consider the derivative as an object by using perceptual representations at an early stage of the acquisition process. Also they all could calculate the derivative at a point by using symbolic representations. They all formed perceptual representations of the limiting process of the difference quotient but they would still need guidance to connect them to symbolic representations.

A survey is presented which indicates two risks of that approach: On the long term, it seems to have a negative effect on the motivation to work on open or more complex problems. Furthermore, it tends to discourage those with individual reference norm and motivation to participate that is intrinsic and directed on the mathematical content. (Contains 2 tables.)

In 2005, Jobs for the Future conducted a 50-state survey of state higher education plans to determine how many states have set numerical targets for enrollment and completion and how these goals are set, measured, and publicized to institutions, the public, and policymakers. This study asks: When it comes to improving the outcomes of their public higher education systems, do states know where they are trying to go and have they a plan for how and when they will get there? &quot;By the Numbers&quot; assesses whether and how fully each state's higher education strategy documents and plans embrace goal-setting as an approach to improving college access and success. It also highlights efforts in two states, Texas and Kentucky, whose comprehensive strategies provide valuable lessons for other states.

These include serving a diverse group of rural adults who need a variety of services, a changing job market, and vast geographic areas with low population densities. To this end, this study focused on three main areas: adult learners' characteristics and participation patterns, infrastructure for providing services, and funding streams that support literacy and basic education. The study used three types of data sources: focus group discussions of adult education program directors, a survey of adult education program directors, and an analysis of documents from the Pennsylvania Departments of Labor and Industry and Education. The research found that, in addition to the challenges facing all adult education providers, adult education programs in rural Pennsylvania face a unique set of challenges and obstacles.

E2's technology-based curriculum and procedures combined effective computer applications and emergent literacy experiences and were based on the results of a 3-year research study (referred to in this report as E1) of 255 children and their families from diverse cultures and socioeconomic groups; 8 teachers, and 16 half-day preschool classes in rural and urban central Illinois (Godt, Hutinger, Schneider, &amp; Robinson, 1999; Hutinger, 1999; Hutinger. et al., 1998). E2's target population was preschool children with a wide range of disabilities, those at risk, their families, teachers, and program staff. E2 had three major goals: (1) replicate and validate E1 research findings in a range of typical rural and urban educational settings; (2) study  implementation and maintenance of the model as demonstrated by replication sites; and (3) disseminate information related to the study. These goals were supported by five objectives and their tasks. Two objectives related to management and dissemination, while three related to such activities as conducting staff development activities, implementation, and follow-up in replication sites; studying the implementation of the E2 approach in multiple, complex settings; and revising, developing, and disseminating E2 products and materials.

The second issue is a comparison of the types of explanations used for multiplication without zero as opposed to explanations used for multiplication with zero. Results show that more students use MB explanations than PB explanations. However, when multiplying with zero, many students use another type of justification (ie. rule-based explanation).

We discus the hypothesis that the zoom-controls of calculator support the production of gestures and metaphors that foster the shift from a global to a local point of view. The analysis of protocols confirms that the exploration of several functions through the zooming process was supported by gestures and language. They appeared during the zooming process and in pupils' answers to the tests when the calculator was no more available and when the task concerned mathematical objects. (Contains 2 figures.)

We build from our current and ongoing collaborative efforts with middle-grades mathematics teachers to provide an analytic approach and resulting analysis that clarifies the critical role of institutional context in teacher development. The analysis delineates the communities of practice whose enterprises are concerned with how mathematics is taught and learned in the district and the importance of their interconnections (cf. Wenger, 1998). Our approach can best be viewed as a tool designed to support transformative educational change as iterative processes of continual improvement in mathematics education.

        "description":"This pilot study determined some typical cognitive-motivational profiles of Finnish lower secondary students dealing with fractions and decimal numbers. Forty seven students from grades 7-9 participated in a number concept test, where also the motivational aspects, such as self-efficacy, certainty and tolerance were measured. Four distinctively different profiles were found where the cognitive aspect of task sensitivity and the motivational aspect of tolerance were crucial. The results suggest that if students' cognitive distance to the task demands is too wide, the cognitive conflict is passed unnoticed. In addition moderate sensitivity combined with high estimation of self-efficacy and low tolerance seems to be restrictive to a more radical change and deeper understanding of the concepts.

In this study the term representation is interpreted as the tool used for representing mathematical ideas such as tables, equations and graphs (Confrey &amp; Smith, 1991). The first aim of this study is to investigate 12 year old students' understanding of addition of decimal numbers. Second, to explore the way these students understand and utilize the representations of decimal numbers as different concepts - modularization - or as different expressions of the same concept. The third aim of the study is to investigate which modes of representation of decimal numbers are the most difficult ones. Finally, the study is dealing with the differences in students' achievements concerning the issue addressed by the different exercises - concept and addition of decimals.

We find that the arguments of \"constant sum strategists\" develop in the presence of (i) a small group of children with conflicting strategies, (ii) a teacher-researcher who draws attention to the context of the problem as a resource for backing warrants, and (iii) a pictorial tool which can facilitate informal communication.

These concepts may be called \"abstract-general\" because they embody general properties of the real world. A discussion of the relationship between abstract-apart objects and abstract-general concepts leads to the conclusion that a key component in learning about fundamental mathematical objects is the \"formalisation\" of empirical concepts.

The results reveal students tendency to apply proportional reasoning in problem situations in which this kind of reasoning is not suited. This tendency appears to decrease in the second phase of the study when the context of the problems was changed.

We conducted a series of themed Focus Group interviews with mathematicians from six UK universities.

Here we elaborate the theme &quot;the relationship, and its potential, between mathematicians and researchers in mathematics education&quot; that emerged from the data analysis. We do so by presenting the participants views on this relationship in terms of: obstacles, desired characteristics and potential benefits. [For complete proceedings, see ED489538.]",

The findings are based on analysis of 350 answers to problems that demanded communication of reasoning, explanations, and justifications. The results indicate that only a few students, who are very high achievers, choose to communicate via algebraic representations, even after two extensive years of learning algebra. These results might be related to difficulties students have with the abstraction of algebra and the way algebra is taught in school--an issue that should be considered by curriculum developers and teachers.

One student's case is used to portray what prospective teachers attend to in the process of filming/editing and describing/analyzing their teaching practice. Shifting from noticing what to film in retrospect to noticing and filming what was happening in the moment was key for this student as she began to see her own practice as site for learning. This paper points to the power of opportunities for teacher education students to not only learn to analyze video of other's teaching but to also analyze their own.

        "description":"In this paper seventh-grade pupils' ways of handling aspects of probability have been investigated. The aspects in question were embedded in a dice game, based on the total of two dice. Four different set-ups of dice were included in the situation in which they were up to explore optimal strategies for winning the game. How children understand concepts is regarded from the perspective of how the pupils' understanding varies with their interpretation of the situation, in which the concepts are embedded. Empirical data have been analyzed with intentional analysis, a method by which we regard pupils' act as intentional. The results show approaches of extremes and of a number model, as consequences of how the pupils process and bring to the fore information in the situation.

It followed 27 first graders who learned addition and subtraction using an experimental curriculum. The instruction involved a didactical model combining the context of two stories with a structured part-part-whole schema. In addition to collecting data from the whole class, eight children were individually interviewed. The development of their additive structure was examined by comparing the distance between the original stories and the range of transfer problems they could analyze. The findings show that a rich additive structure was constructed, although some difficulties involving dependency on the instructional model were observed. (Contains 3 figures.)

This is achieved by means of a comprehensive graphical profile of the processes. This graphical profile of an individual learner lends itself to detailed analysis and offers new kinds of insights into the learning/teaching processes.

It examines how the visual and verbal cues may affect the kind of mental representations the students' project. The paper traces the way these mental representations may change from an immediate &quot;first&quot; response to a &quot;30 seconds&quot; response. The study reveals that different formats of the stimuli and the elapse of time not only evoke different kinds of mental representation but that these different kinds may be strongly associated with the level of mathematical achievement.

This examination is carried out with reference to verbal protocols of two 17 year-old students working together on a task connected to sketching the graph of |f|x|)|. Examination of the data suggests that abstraction is a difficult activity that can sometimes be beyond student's unassisted efforts, in which case supportive intervention of a scaffolder through several means of  assistance is observed to help the students achieve the abstraction.

In response to a range of tasks, 5 and 8 year-old children manipulated the sample space in ways that generated corresponding outcomes in the game.

For each situation, four cognitive processes were established: the editing of problems based on iconic or symbolic stimuli, the filtering of important and critical information, the comprehending of the structural relations in quantitative information, and the translating on the quantitative information from one mode to another. The data suggested that all four cognitive processes contributed to problem posing abilities with the filtering and editing having a heavier role than the comprehending and translating processes.

Utilizing genetic ideas that developed during the 14th century (Merton College, N. Oresme), activities are developed and mathematical models for solving problems related to uniform motions are proposed, using the graph of velocity vs. time. The view of the covered distance as the area of the figure between the time axis and the velocity curve allows for the use of concepts and propositions of the Euclidean geometry. The use of simple geometric transformations leads to equivalent motion problems of a real context. This approach, applied to a wider range of problems, can form the basis for the introduction of basic concepts of calculus (such as integral, derivative, and their interrelation), in the context of a program of instruction in Senior High School.

It is shown that before using the analysis (\"numerical analysis\") comprised in the method, a \"preparatory analysis\" is required. It was observed that when the use of this analytical process is given sense, the student advances in his/her ability to establish the relationships between the elements of the problem, which central aspect is the numerical equivalence between two quantities that mean the same in the problem. The study also revealed some of the obstacles that obstruct the analytic development. [For complete proceedings, see ED489597.]",

Students' reasoning on the tasks predominantly fell into three types: additive, proportional, or distributional, depending on whether their explanations were driven by frequencies, by relative frequencies, or by both expected proportions and spreads. A high percentage of students' predominant form of reasoning was additive on these tasks. When secondary students were presented with a second series of sampling tasks involving a larger mixture and a larger sample size, they were more likely  to predict extreme values than for the smaller mixture and sample size. In order for students to develop their intuition for what to expect in dichotomous sampling experiments, teachers and curriculum developers need to draw explicit attention to the power of proportional reasoning in sampling tasks. Likewise, in order for students to develop their sense of expected variation in a sampling experiment, they need a lot of experience in predicting outcomes, and then comparing their predictions to actual data.

Twelve scaffolding practices were identified as a result of this activity suggesting that it is a valuable tool for making explicit what teachers know and exercise intuitively in the context of primary mathematics classrooms.

        "description":"The Malaysian educational system tends to take a clear instructionally-focused approach to the teaching of mathematics. This means that many students gain a good procedural command of areas of mathematics. This paper explores one outcome of a teaching experiment in which one area of mathematics (differentiation) was taught in a radically different way which emphasized key concepts rather than procedures. The paper examines how students appear to access their mathematical knowledge in solving problems in a non-mathematical context and demonstrates that there is a strong relationship between an aspect of their language use (transitional words of consequence or contrast) and the form of their mathematical understanding in this area. We discuss the relevance of this finding to the possible structure students' mental spaces. [For complete proceedings, see ED489597].",

Thus, it can be supposed that this reference can help children when adding fractions. This possibility is examined in this investigation, contrasting two situations: one in which half is presented as an anchor during the solution of adding fractions; and another in which other fractional units are offered. The results showed that 8-9-year-old children successfully add fractions when half is offered as an anchor during the solution process, helping in the establishment of equivalencies. In utilising half, children also adopt elaborate strategies expressing equivalence schemes that are relevant to the comprehension of adding fractions. (Contains 4 tables.)

Here we will look into the question of \"similarity\" and point to the possibility of having different perspectives on the same sign as characteristic for an image. This heuristic will be complemented by looking into inscriptions as diagrams (sensu C.S. Peirce), signs constructed and used respecting certain rules. Our main argument is that learning mathematics can be described as a continuous interplay of images and diagrams. The link between these two ways to use inscriptions is offered by metaphors, which help to structure new, maybe chaotic problem situations by means of old pieces of knowledge.

By considering the number-fractionbar-number composite symbol as simultaneously representing division and rational, some process-object theories imply that fraction-as-process and fraction-in-process should be highly related. Our research studied the images evoked in these two situations across a wide range of learners and shows that while students attempted post-hoc justifications of their fraction-in-process calculations using their fraction-as-process images, these images were rarely compatible with the process of addition. Thus, we suggest that the routes to seeing the fraction symbol as process and as object may be cognitively separate.  [For complete proceedings, see ED489597.]",

A collaborative team consisting of the researcher and four second-grade teachers were set up. The collaborative community intended to generate norms of acceptable or appropriate teaching based on what teachers saw about their students' learning mathematics in classroom. Classroom observations and routine meetings were the major data collected in the study. Three main normative concerns the teachers addressed from classrooms including getting students to participate equally, sequencing students' various solutions to review, and getting students to discourse centered on mathematical aspect were described in the paper.

We found that, in general, students had great difficulties in working with parameters but, when they could assign a clear meaning to them, their difficulties decreased.

This process is elaborated through an illustrative example--a Year 8 Australian male student who scaffolded his learning by attending to images in the classroom that were intended for other purposes. Leon's cognitive processing was not &quot;observable&quot; (Dreyfus et al., 2001) in classroom dialogue because Leon &quot;thought alone&quot;. Post-lesson video-stimulated reconstructive interviews facilitated study of Leon's thought processes and extended methodological techniques available to study thinking in classrooms.

The two classes were compared through a post-intervention test of mathematical competency, on which the verbally taught class scored significantly higher.

One is to compare how 7th and 8th graders reason on linear and quadratic geometric number patterns when they have not learned this kind of tasks in school. The other is to explore the hierarchical relations among the four components of reasoning on geometric number patterns: understanding, generalizing, symbolizing, and checking, and to differentiate them between linear and quadratic geometric number patterns. From the national survey results, we argue that reasoning on geometric number patterns is a proper initial activity for learning algebraic thinking in Grade 7, and the relations between the checking component and the other components appear to be different between linear and quadratic patterns. Therefore, we propose that checking can play two kinds of role in reasoning on geometric number patterns. One is to induce a strategy for generalizing, and the other is to initiate the development of symbolizing after it is integrated with generalizing. (Contains 10 tables and 2 figures.)

As a theoretical perspective we use the distinction between transparent and opaque representations, that is,  representations that &quot;show&quot; some features of numbers while they &quot;hide&quot; others. The results suggest that often participants do not rely on the given transparent representation (i.e. 53/83) in determining whether a number is rational or irrational. Further, the results indicate participants' tendency to rely on a calculator and a preference towards decimal over the common fraction representation. As a general recommendation for teaching practice we suggest a tighter emphasis on representations and conclusions that can be derived from considering them.

Data were analyzed according to the forms of representations students used, the progression in students' mathematical language and the operations they employed, and how they attended to one or more varying quantities. Findings indicate that students are capable of functional thinking at grades earlier than perhaps thought. In particular, data suggest that students can engage in covariational thinking as early as kindergarten and are able to describe how quantities correspond as early as 1st-grade. Although pattern finding in single variable data sets is common in elementary curricula, we conclude that elementary grades mathematics should extend further to include functional thinking as well.

Most children saw the underlying structure in terms of 2D shape. Responses from some students indicated that they understood the tessellations only as movements of shapes or saw many of the patterns in 3D.

Thus, this study examines the concerns and EB of primary teachers with respect to a reform concerning the use of Schema Theory in teaching problem solving (PS). A proposed model connecting teachers' EB and concerns is also tested. Analysis of data suggests that teachers? concerns were situated in the first level; teachers seemed to feel more efficacious in teaching PS without using the reform. Teachers' concerns were affected by their EB, which in turn, were affected by first-level concerns. Concerns of succeeding levels were also influenced by concerns of preceding levels. Implications of findings for the development of the reform policy and for further research are drawn. [For complete proceedings, see ED489632.]",

Students use the diagrams to help solve word problems by focusing on the broader structure rather than seeing each problem as an entity in and of itself. The type and sophistication of the diagram can be linked to Sfard's theory (1991 1995) on mathematical development.

An individual curriculum includes contents and reasoning and can be structured in a quasi-logical system of goals and methods, which is the result of teachers' planning of mathematics instruction. There is consent that the planning of individual curricula or the instructional practice is a form of social action. While action is an inner and subjective process, which is dependent on situations and individuals' interpretation of a situation, here, the approach of research is qualitative and interpretative. So, individual curricula are re-constructed from interviews held with eight secondary teachers. One of the eight cases, the one of Mr. A, is lined out here.

We, therefore, investigate the effects of pictures based on their functions in mathematical problem solving (MPS), by high achievement students of Grade 6 in Cyprus, in a communication setting. A number of tasks were developed and techniques of observation and interviews were conducted for gathering qualitative data from eight students. All kinds of pictures, except the decorative one, were found to be conducive to MPS and the communication process. Findings also suggest that the use of pictures in successful MPS depends on the relationship between the picture and the task (function of picture), and on students' mental abilities.

Four classes of third-graders (8 years of age) and their teachers participated in the first year of the program, which involved several preliminary modeling experiences followed by two comprehensive modeling problems over a span of 6 months. Regular teacher meetings involving preparatory workshops as well as reflective analyses were conducted. Analyses of children's responses (in group situations) to one of the modeling problems shows the spontaneous ways in which children engaged in sense making, problem posing, hypothesizing, and mathematizing (including representing). It is argued that modeling tasks of the present type are powerful vehicles for developing important mathematical ideas and problem-solving processes in the early school years.

They were challenged, supported and committed to teaching for achievement of their new aims deriving from an in-service course at a university in Pakistan. The teachers' capacity to learn was increased during the period of research; however, they needed support in dealing with issues for further enhancement of their teaching. The analysis of the teachers? transition from their routine teaching to new teaching revealed the teachers? needs as well as a gap between theory and practices in teacher education.

Data were collected from 1447 pupils in Grades 1, 2 and 3 of elementary school in Cyprus. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) affirmed the existence of four first-order representation-specific factors indicating the differential effects of each particular type of representation and a second-order factor representing the general ability to solve mathematical problems. Results provided support for the invariance of this structure across the three groups of pupils. [For complete proceedings, see ED489632.]",

Based on prior studies on functions and on the potential role of a DG software, we analyze a case study in which the student's reaction to a problem strongly differ from the pattern observed during in-service courses for teachers. We argue that this student's different background allowed her to experience a conflict, which has given her means to expand her conceptualization. Finally, we contrast this behavior with the narrowing effect of mere formulae application, which has been observed in the typical response given by teachers to the same problem during in-service courses.

This study asks: What is the most appropriate way to prepare instrumentally and mentally the future math teachers to the reality demanding permanent competent adjustment to rapidly developing computerized environment in math teaching? In order to try to refer to this question at least partially, the authors designed a research project in which they studied the performances of several groups of students, studying several courses at different levels of mathematical knowledge and embedding a variety of computerized tools. Moreover, they induced all of the students to experience at least two-three different computerized tools in different courses during three years of their main education program. The embedding of computerized tools occurred in  courses in mathematical subject matter courses and in courses in didactics and pedagogy of math teaching. In addition to these, the students took advanced courses in embedding computers in math teaching. Research questions in this study included: How effective are computer-equipped courses in providing the future math teachers with skills and professional qualifications in appropriate computer usage at least for the beginning of their professional career? How students assess their mastering skills in computerized tools developed as  a result of theses courses? To what extent has their attitude towards computer embedding changed during their years in the college? and To what extent do they expect themselves to use computers in their future teaching practice?

In order to analyze these materials, our conception of geometry involved a full spectrum of activities, from concrete exploration and experimentation, through conjecturing, problem solving, and on to formal proof. We also took into consideration results from research on the didactical potential of Dynamic Geometry (DG). It is argued that these programs can help us address fundamental difficulties in developing geometrical thought, as they can provide new representations of geometrical objects. Our aims are to evaluate how close from fulfilling this potential seem to be the instructional materials produced by the teachers themselves and to discuss the main factors influencing teachers' conceptions while developing of these materials.

Consonant with previous research, they indicate that both engagement in school and students' perception of their own academic competence influence achievement in mathematics for high school students. But the study departs from earlier work in suggesting that perceived academic competence may be more influential than engagement in boosting achievement in both mathematics and reading. Indeed, analyses indicate that perceived competence had a stronger influence on subsequent engagement than engagement had on students' perceptions of themselves as competent learners. The findings also make clear that supportive teachers and clear and high expectations about behavior are key to the development of both student engagement and perceived competence. This study suggests that the earlier schools and teachers begin to build students' confidence in their ability to do well, the better off students will be. Because students' perceptions of their capacity for success are key to their engagement in school and learning, schools should be designed to enhance students' feelings of accomplishment. Teachers whom students see as supportive and who set clear expectations about behavior help create an atmosphere in which students  feel in control and confident about their ability to succeed in future educational endeavors.

This study investigated a method of documenting the benefits of developmental courses that involves using placement test scores to predict college outcomes separately for students who take a developmental course before taking standard courses and for those who enroll in standard courses directly. College outcomes were defined in terms of success in standard courses or retention in college. If, among students with a given placement test score, the predicted probability of success or of retention is higher for students who took a developmental course, one would have evidence that this developmental course is beneficial. Multi-year data from two large Midwestern universities were used to illustrate this approach. Simply taking a developmental course did not usually result in benefits. Students who earned high grades (at least a B) in developmental courses, however, were more likely than other students to succeed in standard courses or to persist in college. (Contains 6 figures.)",

Children were considered to be homeschooled if their parents reported them being schooled at home instead of at a public or private school, if their enrollment in public or private schools did not exceed 25 hours a week, and if they were not being homeschooled solely because of a temporary illness. Interviews were conducted with the parents of 11,994 students ages 5 through 17 with a grade equivalent of kindergarten through 12th grade. Of these students, 239 were homeschooled. The NHES is designed to collect data on a wide range of educational indicators and types of students, including, but not limited to, homeschooling. Therefore, readers should note that the  number of questions asked of homeschoolers and the number of homeschoolers represent only a small portion of the NHES collection. The overall response rates for the survey were 54 percent in 2003 and 65 percent in 1999. When the sample is weighted, it represents the approximately 50 million students ages 5 through 17 with a grade equivalent of kindergarten through 12th grade in the United States in 2003. The results of the 2003 NHES survey reveal that the weighted estimate of the number of students being homeschooled in the United States in the spring of 2003 was 1,096,000, a figure which represents a 29 percent increase from the estimated 850,000 students who were being homeschooled in the spring of 1999. The following are appended: (1) Standard Error Tables; and (2) Methodology and Technical Notes. (Contains 7 tables and 3 figures.)",

Section 1 of this book provides an overview of standards-based professional development, both in-service and pre-service, and introduces five questions of standards-based planning for use in judging the current state of professional development programs. Section 2 offers a \"snap-shot\" view of what standards-based professional development programs look like. Section 3 presents an approach for achieving comprehensive professional development for teachers of technology. Section 4 describes approaches and venues for teacher learning. Section 5 provides direction to educators as they evaluate and revise professional development programs. And finally, Section 6 is a call to action with messages for teacher candidates, teacher educators, teachers, and administrators. Several appendices provide helpful information and forms to help users achieve standards-based professional development programs.

For students who admit to harassing others, why do they do it? How does sexual harassment affect students' educational experience? What do students think should be done about sexual harassment on campus? This report analyzes findings from a nationally representative survey of undergraduate college students commissioned by the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation and conducted by Harris Interactive in spring 2005. The report is part of AAUW's continuing work to address the problem of sexual harassment in education. It reveals that colleges and universities still have work to do to foster a campus climate that is free from bias and harassment so that all students have an equal opportunity to excel in higher education. As this research documents, most college students experience some type of sexual harassment while at college, often during their first year. This book contains four chapters: (1) Defining Sexual Harassment on Campus; (2) Prevalence of Sexual Harassment on Campus; (3) Dealing With Sexual Harassment on Campus; and (4) Implications.

One recent example of this trend is the Information Technology (IT) certification programs based on curricula and tests developed by IT companies such as Cisco, Microsoft and Novell. Some educators have suggested that these IT certification programs are attractive because they offer opportunities for students with various levels of academic achievement and postsecondary plans to earn valuable credentials. These programs could serve as a model for other efforts to improve vocational programs by developing assessments and credentials for jobs that do not require a four-year college degree. The discussion presented in this report summarizes key findings relating to the design and resource needs of certification programs, the number and mix of students who have access to and participate in these programs, and participants' outcomes.

        "author":["Schochet, Peter Z."],
        "description":"This paper examines issues related to the statistical power of impact estimates for experimental evaluations of education programs. The focus is on \"group-based\" experimental designs, because many studies of education programs involve random assignment at the group level (for example, at the school or classroom level) rather than at the student level. The clustering of students within groups (units) generates design effects that considerably reduce the precision of the impact estimates, because the outcomes of students within the same schools or classrooms tend to be correlated (that is, are not independent of each other). This, statistical power is a concern for these evaluations. The report is organized into five sections. First, it discusses general issues for a statistical power analysis, including procedures for assessing appropriate precision levels. Second, it discusses reasons that a clustered design reduces the statistical power of impact estimates and provides a simple mathematical formulation of the problem. Third, it presents procedures that can be used to reduce design effects. Fourth, it provides power calculations for impact estimates under various design options and parameter assumptions, and finally, it presents conclusions. Appended is: Values for Factor (.) in Equation (2). (Contains 8 tables.) [This report was submitted by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. to the Institute of Education Sciences.]",

The purpose of this survey is to poll counselors in high schools to discover trends in their work responsibilities, particularly regarding college counseling, and to assess trends that affect students making the transition from high school to college. The second is NACAC's Admission Trends Survey, conducted in August 2004. The purpose of this survey is to poll college admission officers to determine what factors are most important in the admission decision and to assess trends in admission office functions, staff, budget, and operations. More information about these two surveys is included below. The third source is the Common Data Set, which NACAC licensed for aggregate use from the College Board. The final source of data is the federal government, including data from the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Census Bureau. This report is organized into three parts. Part one, State of College Admission, presents the following chapters: (1) High School Graduation and College Enrollment; (2) Applications to College; (3) Admission Strategies; (4) Factors in the College Admission Process; (5) Homeschooled Students in Admission; (6) School Counselors and College Counseling; (7) The College Admission Office; and (8) Paying for College and Financial Aid.

The extent to which the essential components are addressed in the standards and assessments indicates the extent to which states have integrated the essential components into their reading curriculum. This report describes reviews of state assessments and standards, the purpose of which was twofold: to evaluate the degree to which state reading content standards for K-3 students reflected expectations for learning in these five essential areas of effective reading instruction; and to determine the extent to which state assessments administered in the K-3 grade span played a role in the measurement of Reading First outcomes in the five areas. The methods used to address these two purposes differed in both emphasis and approach. This study conducted an expert review in January 2004 of state reading content standards for grades K-3 from a random sample of 20 states. Five consultants with expertise in reading instruction, scientifically based reading research, staff development in reading, and familiarly with state content standards reviewed the standards from the 20 selected states. Teams of two reviewers determined how many of each state's standards represent the five areas of reading instruction and the degree to which this representation is clear, is appropriate for the intended grade level, provides complete coverage of each area, and provides an appropriate level of detail to guide instruction. Appended are: (1) National Reading Panel Description of the Essential Components of Reading Instruction; (2) Stratified Random Sample of 20 States; (3) Documentation Used in Review of State K-3 Reading Standards in 2003-04; (4) Standards Review Instrument; (5) State Assessment Review Form Sample Page; and (6) Results of Analyses of Ratings of State K-3 Reading Standards.

        "description":"Nearly 20 years ago, the first national assessment of student achievement in U.S. history yielded disappointing results. Although policy-makers and researchers expressed great concern about the low scores, the federal government did not undertake large-scale efforts to address poor student performance, and few research dollars were dedicated to uncovering the causes of the problem. In 2001, after the release of another report describing the woeful state of history education, Congress acted, charging the Department of Education with creating the Teaching American History (TAH) Program to improve teacher content knowledge of and instructional strategies for U.S. history. In its first two years, the program's total funding increased from $50 million to $100 million and grants were awarded to 174 local districts that proposed to serve a total of 24,000 teachers. During this time period, the TAH program found a receptive audience and appeared to be providing the resources needed to meet its stated goals. The evaluation of the 2001 and 2002 grantee cohorts indicates, however, that the projects may not have reached those teachers typically considered most in need of additional professional development, and that the training provided did not always match research-based definitions of effective professional development. This report is designed to answer three broad groups of research study questions: the types of activities TAH grantees are implementing; the content of the activities, including the specific subjects and areas of American history on which projects are focusing; and the characteristics and qualifications of teachers participating in the activities. (See Appendix A for complete list of research questions and data sources.) This report draws on multiple data sources (project director and participant surveys, case studies of eight TAH projects, an exploratory analysis of teacher work products, and an extensive document review) to describe both the challenges accomplishments of the 174 TAH projects from the 2001 and 2002 cohorts of grantees. The evaluation was conducted from October 2002 until May 2005.

        "description":"Doctoral students, during the course of their training, develop an academic habitus that corresponds to their field of study. They adopt the perspective of the senior members of their discipline, among which their supervisor, and identify themselves to the academic profession. Consequently, the majority envision themselves in academic positions more than in any other type of employment. This situation, however, may be changing: as higher education policy advocates closer cooperation between universities and other types of organizations, many graduate students are now exposed to different socialization settings and processes. They may consequently develop different professional identities. Based on a survey of 956 graduate students from Quebec (Canada), our paper will attempt to understand the impact of cooperative research agreements on doctoral students career projects. Aspects of the socialization process such as topic selection, funding, interaction with university supervisor, interaction with non-university researchers, publication of research results and involvement in commercialization efforts will be explored. We will attempt to explain the observed differences in terms of socialization setting and process, and identify the main predictors of the different career options preferred by aspiring PhDs. Finally, we will explore the possible impact of the ongoing transformations of graduate education for the future of academic research.",

Evidence does exist, though, that this gap can be narrowed and potentially eliminated. Evidence also exists that demonstrates that when the gap in academic achievement becomes equal African-Americans are more likely to complete college and earn nearly the same income as Whites. Educators must understand the many reasons for the achievement gap and find ways to narrow the gap and further ensure the future success of all students. It is the purpose for this thesis to explore the reasons for the achievement gap and some possible solutions for narrowing the gap. Specifically, the paper will show one possible solution - the Academy structure. [This thesis was presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Masters of Education.]",

        "description":"How are first grade classrooms using technology? How are children using technology at home? Does the use of technology really improve academic achievement? An experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of using technology to teach a unit in Social Studies to first grade students. The study occurred in a Christian school in Lancaster, Ohio using thirty-seven first grade students. One class comprised the control group with Social Studies instruction taught in a traditional manner. The other class was the experimental group, which used technology such as the Internet, PowerPoint Presentations, and video and audio recordings to provide the instruction. One Social Studies unit was used in the six-week study with an assessment taken each week. Independent-Samples T-Tests were done on the six assessments. Only one of the assessments showed a significant difference in scores in favor of the experimental group. The other five assessments did not show a significant difference. Due to the experimental group having one of the assessments showing a statistically significant difference, and to the fact that the means were higher on four of the other tests, although not significantly, the researcher is encouraged that technology does provide a difference in student achievement. When combined with the increase in interest and enjoyment of the students using technology, technology appears to be a positive motivation for student achievement.

        "description":"Electricity is an important and challenging science topic at all school levels. Learners often have many difficulties in learning electricity. Previous attempts to overcome these difficulties have been rather one-sided, leaning only on one method at the time, and thus ineffective. As a solution, a learning environment which combines the strengths of traditional laboratory exercise and simulation working with tasks that structure student work and explicitly address common difficulties in learning electricity was developed. This experimental study examined if this 1) simulation-laboratory-combination environment can enhance elementary school students understanding of simple DC circuits compared to those students that only 2) use a simulation or work with 3) traditional hands-on laboratory methods. As a result, compared to traditional laboratory work, the simulation-laboratory-combination environment was particularly effective. It improved more effectively students' overall knowledge of DC circuits and facilitated the development of scientifically acceptable models of current flow and current division.

        "description":"Chinese higher education has undergone dramatic changes since the mid-1980s. Over the past two decades, the traditional public system of higher education has transformed to be more diversified with increasing non-government involvement. This paper tries to examine the recent reforms in the light of governance with a particular emphasis on policy process. The analysis is based on a triangle framework of co-ordination in higher education among three corners, namely state, market and civil society. As the framework as well as associated governance theory was derived from a Western context, the paper discusses the possibility of its application in China. It suggests that, regardless of scholarly debate, governance, as part of universal reform ideologies, has practically affected the Chinese society and higher education reforms. However, because the beliefs underlying governance are far different from those in China, the Chinese higher education reforms evidence a distinctive path, suffering lots of paradoxes and challenges in policy process.

        "description":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of reverent relationships on learning. The hypothesis was, that if an instructor individualizes a curriculum, they can and will facilitate &quot;the love of learning.&quot; If projects were personalized, students would find themselves interested in their work. Hence, they would be more creative and productive.  Discipline problems would diminish. Methodology: Five groups of students, meeting for one hour a day, five days a week, for an eighteen-week period were evaluated. These pupils were required to take this class to meet their &quot;Fine Arts&quot; requirements. Few, if any had a sincere interest in the Arts. These were compared with similar groups, taught in manners that are more traditional. The groups included students from various socio-economic backgrounds.  The majority of the students were from lower-middle class families.  Parent participation was not high. Few, if any parents were involved in the students' school lives.  The grade levels were nine through twelve, high school. The school was one within the Anaheim Union High School District, in Cypress, California. In this essay, the story of one student is used as an example for many.  Interviews, observations, production, and progress were the guides for assessment. Results: Grades were not the determinant that differentiated the two groups.  Grades may not be as objective as student interest is.  Voluntary participation in after school and lunchtime activities, improved academic performance in all subjects, and enrollments in colleges were the factors used to verify a true commitment to learning. Conclusions: A strong relationship between the educator and the student, between the student and the subject, contributes to and creates a strong relationship between the student and the school, between the student and the idea of education.  Students learn, and love learning. Recommendations: An educator must be patient, any are. They must authentically encourage learning, and be sensitive to the manner in which each individual student learns. Educators must empathize! Empathy is the best educator! Mentors must trust that they and the students can and will enjoy the growth, energy, and that each will grow greater!",

Nonparametric statistics were used to compare responses among schools. The results of the study indicate that school achievement level is not related to the use of test preparation practices. However, the number of sources of pressure to increase test scores does contribute to the use of certain test preparation activities. Also, there were no state-wide trends in the use of motivational activities/incentives related to test scores, although over half of the schools in the sample did use some type of student incentives.

Besides, after radio began its first broadcasting, new inventions affected its development two ways: 1) the first one was the technological developments of sciences. For instance, the invention of transistors made it possible to create very small radio machines, and also the use of FM broadcastings were able to deliver the first stereo programs, and 2) the last one is the program dimensions of radio broadcastings. The various program styles and formats of radio have been broadcasted gradually for many years, such as countless music, drama, entertainment, culture, documentary, sporting events, news or education programs. Both the technical dimensions and program producing processes of radio can affect the use of interactive educational radio programs. Accordingly, the main purpose of this article is to explain the infrastructure of interactive educational radio programs, and to introduce a framework about how to develop interactive educational radio programs in e-learning systems.

        "description":"Cognitive/Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) is a construct developed by linguists that distinguishes everyday conversational language and language used in literature and on academic tests.  The &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; has created impetus for scientifically researched pedagogy that serves to increase academic achievement of groups who have been historically marginalized. Lack of CALP was identified as one factor that may prevent academic advancement among certain populations. An experiment was performed to demonstrate a causal relationship between increased CALP and improved Ohio Proficiency Test Scores. Twenty-three low-achieving sixth grade students, six of whom had IEPs, received an eight-week treatment program to improve their cognitive/academic language.  Pre-and post-tests assessed changes in proficiency test scores. Differences in scores were statistically analyzed. Scores showed a significant positive treatment effect for students not on IEPs. The development of cognitive/academic language shows promise as a method for improving the proficiency test scores of low-achieving students.

Although we expect variation based on theory, there is reason to believe that observed variation in item parameter estimates exceeds what theory would predict. This study examined both items that were administered linearly in a fixed order each time that they were used and items that had appeared in different adaptive testing item pools. The study looked at both the magnitude of variation in the item parameter estimates and the impact of this variation in the estimation of test-taker scores. The results showed that the linearly administered items exhibited remarkably small variation in parameter estimates over repeated calibrations. Similar findings with adaptively administered items in another high stakes testing program were also found when initial adaptively based item parameter estimates were compared with estimates from repeated use. The results of this study also indicated that context effects played a more significant role in adaptive item parameters when the comparisons were made to the parameters that were initially obtained from linear paper-and-pencil testing.",

        "author":["Stoneberg, Bert D., Jr."],
        "description":"The purpose of this study was to screen for gender-based (female-male) and ethnic-based (Hispanic-White) differential item functioning (DIF) in the 2003 Idaho Standards Achievement Tests of reading, language arts and mathematics at grades 4, 8 and 10. The vendor, the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), assembled the computer-administered tests using items from its Rasch-calibrated item bank and items from Idaho teachers that were equated to the item bank metric. The absence of DIF statistics for any of these test items led to this study. NWEA provided random samples of data representing about half of the students completing each grade-level test that ranged from 8,659 for the tenth grade mathematics test to 9,676 for the fourth grade language usage test. This study used the Simultaneous Item Bias Test (SIBTEST), which assesses item dimensionality, and the Mantel-Haenszel Chi Square Test to detect statistically significant DIF in the individual items. A Bonferonni correction controlled for Type I error. Effect size procedures described whether the observed statistical differences were large enough to have practical meaning. This study also noted DIF findings from a concurrent NWEA analysis of item parameter invariance in the 2003 Idaho tests.  The proportion of items exhibiting moderate to high gender-based DIF ranged from seven percent for the fourth grade reading test to 37 percent for the tenth grade mathematics test. The proportion of items exhibiting moderate to high ethnic-based DIF ranged from seven percent for the eighth grade mathematics test to 19 percent for the fourth grade tests of reading and language arts. The study recommended that NWEA and independent curriculum specialists review all items exhibiting moderate to high DIF before further use, that the state examine the impact of the high occurrence of DIF on the ability to accurately interpret the spring 2003 student scores, and that the state add language to the vendor contract requiring DIF analyses of all items used in future administrations of the statewide tests.

          "Kelly, Martin G."],
        "description":"This project used a constructivist teaching method, &quot;white boarding&quot;, in a high school biology classroom. This study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of white boarding activities. White boarding is a term used to describe the student use of a 3' x 2' sheet of tile board to record group work. After the teacher presents a question or problem, students write on the white board with dry erase markers. Here, white boarding was used to foster cooperative learning of biochemical processes in living organisms, diffusion through a cell membrane, and protein synthesis. Six biology classes that used white boarding were compared to six classes that received the traditional method of teacher-centered instruction.  This interactive method, when coupled with students' focusing on problematic concepts, has been shown to increase the engagement and understanding of students in physics classrooms. This study is the first to measure the effects of white boarding activities in high school biology classes. Test scores and a survey were used to measure the academic benefits of white boarding activities. A significant ten-point increase in test scores was recorded for students who employed white boarding activities when compared to those who did not experience white boarding. Neither teacher or student gender affected the academic benefit students received through white boarding. However, there remained a difference in the amount of academic benefit realized by students through white boarding associated with ethnicity. Even so, African American students that white boarded consistently achieved higher exam scores than African American students receiving typical instruction. In spite of the known benefit associated with white boarding, 84.4% of these students disagreed with the statement that white boarding had helped them achieve higher test scores.  In contrast, 91.8% of these students agreed that white boarding provided dialogue, 71.6 % agreed that white boarding helped them to reach and develop solutions to problems. White boarding promoted a student centered learning environment, and fostered student collaborative learning.  White boarding gave the students the opportunity to have academic discussion in the classroom, to reach and develop a shared solution to important questions, and to resolve their misconceptions.

        "description":"This research compared the outcomes of teaching middle school students two different methods of classification and phylogeny. Two classes were randomly selected and taught using traditional methods of instruction. Three classes were taught using the \"Pseudozoid\" approach, where students learned to classify, develop and read dichotomous keys, and make evolutionary diagrams using artificial organisms. Here, the pseudozoids are twenty-six different artificial organisms that have body shapes representing the twenty-six letters of the alphabet. For each method, students were divided into small cooperative learning groups based on my estimation of student ability to learn and work cooperatively (i.e. high learner, medium learner, and low learner). A pre-test and test were administered to all classes. The data was used to measure the amount of learning associated with the traditional method or Pseudozoid method. A survey was given to all students after the unit on classification and phylogeny was completed to measure student satisfaction. No significant differences in test results, learning, or student satisfaction were found between the types of teaching method used. That no significant differences were seen could be due in part to the similarity in the teaching methods or to test questions that were unable to detect slight differences in student learning.

        "description":"Purpose: This annotated bibliography is focused intentionally on postsecondary peer cooperative learning programs that increasing student achievement. Peer learning has been popular in education for decades. As both a pedagogy and learning strategy, it has been frequently adapted for a wide range of academic content areas at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Increased attention has been placed on this practice due to claims by some programs that carefully managed learning programs with specific protocols can increase student persistence rates towards graduation, supporting both student goal aspirations as well as bolstering institutional revenues. Methodology: An extensive literature search was conducted of published journal articles, newspaper accounts, book chapters, books, ERIC documents, thesis and dissertations, online documents, and unpublished reports. Student peer learning programs in this bibliography meet the following characteristics: (a) program must have been implemented at the postsecondary or tertiary level, (b) program has a clear set of systematic procedures for its implementation at an institution, (c) program evaluation studies have been conducted and are available for review, (d) program intentionally embeds learning strategy practice along with review of the academic content material, (e) program outcomes include both increased content knowledge with higher persistence rates, and (f) program has been replicated at another institution with similar positive student outcomes. Results: From a review of the professional literature, more than 730 citations emerged concerning six programs that met the previously mentioned selection criteria: Accelerated Learning Groups (ALGs), Emerging Scholars Program (ESP), Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL), Structured Learning Assistance (SLA), Supplemental Instruction (SI), and Video-based Supplemental Instruction (VSI). Some of the programs share common history and seek to improve upon previous practices. Frequently when peer cooperative programs are adopted for use outside the institution or country of origin, it is often contextualized for the educational system and needs of each individual setting. Nearly one fourth of the entries in this bibliography are from authors and researchers outside of United States. Conclusions: Through a careful analysis of peer reviewed and fugitive literature, more than 730 annotated citations were discovered that identify six major peer cooperative learning programs that have been implemented in a diverse number of educational settings, different academic disciplines, and various student populations to increase student academic achievement and persistence rates. Recommendations: Educators need to investigate these peer learning programs to discover effective learning practices that can be adapted and adopted for use in supporting higher student achievement.",

This study also analyzed the administrators' perspective of the Academy's curriculum along various facets, including the three main criteria previously listed by means of a survey.  Along this realm, the study determined that both students and school administrators found that the following three components were beneficial towards the at risk youths' academic success: a) a reduced student to teacher ratio that allowed for one on one tutoring b) a stable and productive mentorship program and c) a curriculum that provides for the multiple intelligences to be exercised--especially in terms of outdoor activities and computer skills. This study discovered that for this particular school system, the three key components listed above were academically and socially advantageous to the youths who were considered as being at risk of social and academic failure.

        "description":"Using the base year data of parent interviews (n=15,376) conducted by the U. S. Department of Education for the national Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K), this study examined patterns of parenting style of Asian-American parents (n=536) in six domains.  Descriptive and ANOVA analyses revealed significant differences between Asian-American parents and parents in European-American, African-American, and Hispanic groups in their expectations of child's education attainment and expression of affection to children. More similarities than differences among the four ethnic groups were found in parental attitudes towards child's areas of development in kindergarten, parental school involvement, parental involvement with child at home, and parent disciplinary style. The Asian-American parents were further divided into three subgroups to examine possible with-in group differences. The three groups were: (1) Two parents, both parents are Asian-American (n=343), (2) Asian-American single parents (n=45), and (3) two parents with one parent being Asian-American (n=31). Results showed that although the three subgroups of parents differ in social economical status and education level, there were very few significant differences in all six domains of parenting across these three subgroups. This finding suggests that Asian parenting style is prominent in families as long as one parent is Asian-American. Policy and educational implications were discussed. Future directions of study are also suggested.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of scaffolding in helping students understand a complex problem. Seventy-nine 10th-grade students (15 to 16 years old) from an urban public school participated in this study. The ethnic breakdown of the students at this school was: 39.4% White, 18% Black, 22.4% Hispanic, and 20.3 % Asian and others. A multimedia learning environment called Pollution Solution was developed specifically for this research and was based on an instructional model that builds on the cognitive flexibility theory (CFT) and incorporates situated cases and scaffolding elements from a variety of constructivist theories and models. Four classes were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions which each received different scaffolded versions of the environment.  Results indicated that the scaffolding had a significant effect on students' problem understanding but did not have a significant effect on their consideration of the multiple perspectives of the problem or their misconceptions. Thus, scaffolding used in conjunction with CFT principles was not found to hinder students' ability to consider multiple perspectives or to cause an increase in their misconceptions. On the other hand, scaffolding that provided students with an organizing template significantly improved their understanding of the problem. However, this organization scaffold tended not to be as effective when combined with other scaffolding. These findings highlight the importance of testing the effects of individual scaffolds in addition to testing the overall effect of the combined scaffolding. (Contains 8 tables and 3 figures).",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to recommend policy changes that would enhance Vietnamese community colleges related to lifelong learning, governance, and program relevance. The project was not a typical education research paper. The study utilized a policy-oriented research methodology. Its purpose was not to yield &quot;findings&quot; in the traditional research sense. Instead, the purpose of policy-oriented research was to first identify and assess policy problems and then convincingly advocate to decision makers a specific future course of action or inaction. Therefore, the results of this study were not &quot;findings&quot; but rather substantiated recommendations that would enhance community colleges. First, the study examined exemplary international models in the research literature related to the three policy subtopics. Second, the political, economic and social context pertinent to the current policy environment in Vietnam was discussed. Third, the relevant current and draft new legislation was discussed as well as a case study documenting the innovative practices at the Tra Vinh Community College and their potential impact upon policy. Fourth, the study's future oriented recommendations were detailed and underlying rationale explained. The study made four recommendations. First, to promote lifelong learning, policy should develop community colleges' unique position in order to facilitate academic credit transfer (i.e., articulation) between the post secondary vocational and college programming levels. Second, external stakeholders should form at least half the representation on the mandatory institutional advisory boards that provide non-binding advice to provincial People's Committees.  Third, community colleges should annually collect and report key performance indicator data (i.e., graduate employment and self employment rates, etc.) to the government.  Fourth, Vietnamese researchers should explore further community college case studies in Vietnam.  In particular, further case study research should examine other education and training institutions to determine the impact of different innovative models designed to achieve the new legislation's objectives.

        "author":["Newman, Lynn"],
        "description":"The National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2) provides the first national picture of the involvement of families in the educational development of their secondary-school-age children with disabilities. NLTS2 has a nationally representative sample of more than 11,000 students who were ages 13 through 16 and receiving special education services in grade 7 or above when they were sampled in 2000. Information from NLTS2 is weighted to represent youth with disabilities nationally as a group, as well as youth in each of the 12 federal special education disability categories used in NLTS2. Information in this report was gathered from parents/guardians of NLTS2 youth in telephone interviews or through mail questionnaires in the spring and summer of 2001. Findings indicate that families of most students with disabilities are very involved in supporting their children's educational development at home and school, with almost all participating in at least one type of school-based activity. Most families report regularly talking with their children about school and helping with homework at least once a week. One in five provide homework assistance as often as five or more times per week. Students with disabilities are more likely to receive help with homework than are their peers in the general population. The difference in homework support is especially apparent for those who receive frequent help; students with disabilities are five times as likely as their peers in the general population to receive homework assistance frequently.  Nearly 9 out of 10 parents of secondary-school-age students with disabilities report participating in at least one IEP meeting in the current or prior school year. Several characteristics of students with disabilities are related to the participation of their families in their educational development, when controlling for other differences. Most variations in levels of participation associated with differences in family and youthtics for youth with disabilities parallel those for families of students in the general population. The importance of family involvement and expectations is supported by NLTS2 analyses. Parents' activities in support of their children's education is associated with consistent differences in several achievement domains, independent of disability, functioning, or other differences among youth. These findings have implications for special education practice, especially related to family-school communication, information and support, and teacher training.",

Beginning in 2000 a six-year trend of declining average units attempted by Los Rios students appeared to be changing with three years of steady increase through Fall 2002.  This trend of increasingly higher units has continued, with average units surpassing those of the early 1990's, from a then high average 7.16 units in 1993 to an average 7.57. in Fall 2004. This Research brief takes a close look at the changing patterns of enrollment, especially by the age of Los Rios students, and summarizes the impact of age on the increase in average units attempted.",

I discuss the entire postdoctoral experience in terms of activities and responsibilities, building and maintaining relationships, and negotiating the process as a postdoctoral fellow toward a junior faculty position in academia. I encourage potential postdoctoral fellows to navigate their positions with creativity, focus on developing academic credentials, and maintain strong relationships with senior faculty, other postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students.

        "author":["Yeung, Yau-Yuen"],
        "description":"This paper presentation will report on how some science educators at the Science Department of The Hong Kong Institute of Education have successfully employed an array of innovative learning media such as three-dimensional (3D) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to create seven sets of resource kits, most of which are being placed on the Internet (website address http://www.ied.edu.hk/has/ised/3dvr.htm) to provide a wide variety of self-learning materials to support the effective training of science teachers. Since a decade ago, it has been perceived that virtual reality would re-shape our socio-cultural life in the 21st century because it has a wide diversity of impressive and practical applications such as 3D medical imaging, product and architectural design, visualization of complex scientific data, molecular/crystal modeling, games/entertainment, training and education. With the rapid advancement in 3D and computer technologies, VR has become much more user-friendly and affordable in prices and so within a few years, it will likely be incorporated as a part of the IT in education movement as advocated by many national/local governments in their educational reform agenda. Furthermore, it is quite feasible to develop various kinds of teaching and learning resources in Science using certain kinds of &quot;lightweight&quot; (relatively simple and inexpensive) VR and 3D visualization technologies. Based on our professional experience in teaching various science topics, we have uncovered and identified many topics which are well-known to cause obstacles/difficulties to the students (and in particular the physics subject) but they can be taught and learned more effectively with the aid of 3D visualization and/or virtual reality (Yeung, 2002). Examples of those 3D/VR learning objects or courseware that we have developed (Wang &amp; Yeung, 2001) specifically for training science teachers include: A Problem on Uniform Motion and Acceleration, Basic Optics in 3D, Virtual Reality Crystal Lattices, The Earth and the Moon around the Sun, and Human Skull and interactive 3D molecules of some common chemical or biological substances. Those 3D and VR resources could be used for the learning and teaching of mechanics, optics, materials science, astronomy, molecular biology and chemistry etc. It is widely believed (Youngblut, 1998) that they are capable of enhancing student-centered (or self-organized) learning because of various unique features and educational values as embedded in using 3D and VR media for learning. Furthermore, those self-learning resources can help students develop their ability to visualize, understand and mentally construct the details of complex scientific data and models which will otherwise be lost, distorted or easily misinterpreted in planar 2D projection (or monoscopic images). A questionnaire survey had been administered to 361 student-teachers to collect information about their prior knowledge, attitude and evaluation of these innovative learning technologies. The preliminary survey findings which provide empirical evidences for supporting our learner-centered approach will be presented and discussed in this paper together with some educational values and implications for the learning and teaching of certain science topics in the school environment.",

        "description":"By extracting all authors of articles published in the 3 most popular international journals of physics education for a period of ten years, some collaboration (co-authorship) networks have been constructed based on the criterion that if any two authors have published a paper together, they are labeled as connected or linked by research collaboration in physics education. We have then obtained numerical values for the average number of collaborators, size of clusters formed between physics teachers as well as values of the clustering coefficient.  On comparison with the co-authorship networks of scientists in physics, high-energy physics, biomedical science and computer science, our results show that the physics teaching communities are highly fragmented on a global scale by forming many small clusters (or local groups) around the world. However, the internal collaboration within each cluster is astonishingly strong. In this paper, we shall furthermore discuss the implications of those differences on the world-wide dissemination of new or innovative teaching ideas and practices from one physics teacher or educator to the rest in this teaching profession.",

        "title":"Successful African-American Mathematics Students in Academically Unacceptable High Schools",
        "author":["Sheppard, Peter A., IV"],
        "description":"The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the reasons why successful mathematics students have been able to thrive in schools labeled academically unacceptable and (2) why they have chosen to stay in these academically unacceptable schools despite having the option to leave for a better performing school. Qualitative methods including group interviews, individual interviews, and open ended questionnaires were used to address the above issues. The study involved eleven successful mathematics students, two teachers, and two principals from two Louisiana high schools deemed academically unacceptable according to the Louisiana's accountability system. For the sake of this study, successful students were defined as those students who scored at the Advanced or Mastery level in mathematics on Louisiana's Graduate Exit Exam (GEE) required for high school graduation. In spring 2003 only 6% of Louisiana's African-American students scored in the Advanced or Mastery range.  Results indicate that students attribute their success in mathematics to good teachers, personal character traits (ability to focus, desire to succeed, determination, curious/inquisitive nature, and overall belief in self), and parental influence. Adult participants attributed students' success to aptitude, fortitude, and purposeful commitment. The participants chose not to attend better performing schools because they feel comfortable at their current school, and have developed a degree of trust at their current school. Moreover, the participants believe that graduating from a school with problems such as those associated with academically unacceptable schools will better prepare them for the &quot;real world.&quot; It is unlikely that the designers of accountability systems can fathom the conditions present in academically unacceptable schools. Educators and those who aspire to improve low-performing schools must take heed of the advice of those who have experienced success under the duress of attending an unacceptable school. Very few solutions include the suggestions of students who actually succeed while enduring troubling circumstances. If input from successful mathematics students is consistently ignored, it is likely that the current achievement gap will persist. Consequently, a generation of underserved African Americans from inner-city schools may become disenfranchised--with no high school diploma and limited means to fulfill the American Dream.

        "author":["Juuti, Kalle"],
        "description":"This thesis describes a project to design a primary school physics learning environment which takes into account teachers' needs, design procedures, properties of the learning environment, and pupil learning outcomes. The project's design team has wide experience in research and development work in relation to science education, the use of ICT in education, the way students think about physics, curriculum and teaching method development, and the design of instructional materials. This knowledge base was the starting point for design. The project engaged in design research. Design research is here considered to be a form of educational research, and offers opportunities to study unique educational phenomena. It produces artefacts to be applied directly in an educational setting, and thereby engages the researcher in the direct improvement of educational practice. Design research can even offer a strategy for the development and refinement of educational theory. The first main research result was a design procedure. The procedure contained four phases: 1) needs assessment; 2) definition of the objectives for a design solution; 3) design and production of the material; and 4) evaluation of the material. The phases apply research literature and empirical research. Phases three and four are iterative and include three stages: limited use of the prototype, a pilot test and a field test. The second main result was a designed learning environment as an example of a learning environment. The research showed that an environment should be: 1) concrete and illustrative, offering examples for the classroom; 2) mentally stimulating, for both study and practical work; 3) physically and pedagogically meaningful 4) usable; 5) offer peer and expert support for teachers. In addition, the research uncovered many contextual features that are important concerning the usability of the learning environment. The third main result was that qualitative level models delivered by way of stories offer much potential for learning primary school physics. From the Finnish perspective, the designed learning environment offers a novel phenomenon to investigate primary physics teaching and learning in a new situation where, from the point of view of this research, rather ambitious new National Framework Curriculum for physics education has been introduced.

It provides an overview of the challenges these young people face and includes research about why they leave their homes, how they live after leaving, and what interventions are being used to assist them. It is broken down into sections on history, definitions, estimates, research, legislation, education, and interventions. Studies mentioned are predominantly those with larger numbers of participants who are fairly representative of the actual population of homeless youth. The information should be especially helpful for advocates who disseminate information to increase community awareness of pertinent issues and strategies to serve unaccompanied youth, service providers and policymakers interested in effective programs and where they may focus their efforts to serve unaccompanied youth, and researchers who want to identify gaps in the knowledge base.",

        "description":"This manuscript, compiled by the National Center for Homeless Education, is the outcome of the first year of a two-year project designed to explore what works in reading instruction for students who are highly mobile. It summarizes the findings of a review of literature on teaching reading to highly mobile students. The target population included elementary-grade students who are highly mobile due to the stressors of poverty. The project includes an extensive literature review to identify what is already known. Reading research focusing on mobility is not widely available; consequently, the first chapters provide information about mobility. There is a growing body of research on reading instruction for students living in poverty. Since poverty is a common factor among mobile students, this research aligns most closely and may offer effective reading practices for students who are highly mobile. The review identifies practical, real-life applications of the concepts and strategies found in the literature. The review concludes with recommendations for educators that range from broad policy and school district-level strategies, to the classroom-level with general organizational structures and proposed reading practices suggested by current research. The next phase of the two-year project will identify resources that are easily accessible to practitioners. These will be disseminated as a &quot;toolkit&quot; companion to the current document.",

        "author":["Margulies, Barry J.",

        "description":"Medical Microbiology is a content-intensive course that requires a large time commitment from the students. Students are typically biology or prenursing majors, including students headed for professional schools, such as medical school and pharmacy school. This group is somewhat diverse in terms of background science coursework, so it can be difficult to teach in a way that benefits all the students. Numerous changes have been implemented in our microbiology curriculum to address the different abilities of our students by altering assessment and teaching strategies. It was hypothesized that changing the assessment strategy from the traditional scheme of two or three exams and one final to a new model of seven or eight shorter exams would have a positive impact on student comprehension and retention. The quantity of material taught or expected of the students to learn did not change, but there was definitely an impact on them. Although 30.0% of students routinely did not pass microbiology in previous semesters, the new method of assessment resulted in only 9.63% not completing the semester successfully, as determined by earning a grade of C or better. There is some evidence from conversations and interviews with students that indicates a positive impact of this methodology on student attitude. Implementation of these changes in other courses and their current effectiveness will be examined in the future, with an eye towards more broadly applicable successful teaching techniques in the sciences, especially for nonmajors.

We compared the two courses through statistical analysis of student performances on the final examinations and the course overall and student assessment of teaching. The data indicated that there was no statistical difference in performance on the final examinations or the course overall. Responses on an instrument of evaluation revealed that students less strongly affirmed the following measures in the hybrid course: (i) The amount of work was appropriate for the credit received, (ii) Interactions between students and instructor were positive, (iii) I learned a great deal in this course, and (iv) I would recommend this course to other students.

        "description":"Based on analyses and recommendations reported in School Improvement Planning: What's Missing?, the present report proposes ways to (a) reorganize school improvement guidance and (b) expand standards and accountability to encompass a component to address barriers to learning and teaching. In doing so, the work highlights the need and a focus for new directions for student support. Specifically suggested is that school improvement guides be reorganized with two interacting dimensions in mind: One encompasses three primary and essential components of an integrated systems approach to schooling. The other stresses five key areas of concern for systemic improvement related to each component. The three components are those encompassing comprehensive, multifaceted, and cohesive efforts to (a) facilitate instruction, (b) address barriers to learning, and (c) govern, lead, and manage schools. The key areas of concern are (a) framing and delineating intervention functions, (b) reworking infrastructure, (c) enhancing resource use, (d) continuous capacity building, and (e) continuous evaluation and appropriate accountability based on delineated standards and quality indicators. Because school improvement planning across the country is \"standards-based\" and accountability driven, establishing standards and expanding the current focus of accountability are important facets of ensuring high levels of attention and support for development of comprehensive, multifaceted approaches to address barriers to learning.  Therefore, much of this report is devoted to delineating standards and outlining an expanded framework for school accountability for a component to address barriers. Standards are organized in terms of the five key areas of concern. An appendix is included.",

        "description":"The aim of this paper is to examine a variety of features of research that might account for mixed findings of the relationship between teachers' subject matter knowledge and student achievement based on meta-analytic technique. Of several variables that might contribute to inconsistencies and variations in study findings, three features of research--measurement, data analysis techniques, and the samples of subjects--are especially explored. Relevant studies including 4 journal articles, 1 conference paper, 4 reports, and 18 dissertations provide 64 effect sizes to represent the association between  subject matter knowledge. The overall mean effect size and its 95% confidence interval are obtained under random-effects model. Then, the effects of potential moderator variables on the relationship between teachers' subject-matter knowledge and student learning are examined using both weighted regression analysis and AN OVA-like categorical analysis. Result indicates that teachers' subject matter knowledge is positively related to student mathematics achievement but the magnitude of the estimated mean correlation coefficient across the 27 studies was very small under the random-effects model. The strength of the relationship between teachers' subject matter knowledge and student mathematics achievement was moderated by different types of indicators of subject matter knowledge and grade level taught, but none of moderators fully explains the variations among the correlations between teachers' subject matter knowledge and student achievement. In particular, under the random-effects model, the estimated mean correlation was .02 when subject matter knowledge was measured by educational background variables, but the estimated mean correlation was .11 when subject matter knowledge was measured by teacher tests. In addition, while the estimated mean correlation was .05 at the elementary level (grade 1-6), the estimated mean correlation was .07 at the l researchers or policy makers who make inferences about the relationship between teachers' subject matter knowledge and student learning and methodologists who want to carry out research synthesis in education or social science as well. However, it is required to explore more moderators to fully explain variations in the relationship between teachers' subject matter knowledge and student achievement.

It emphasizes learning through reflection on experience and through the exchange of thoughts with others. Guided by this pedagogical model, asynchronous discussion was implemented in an EFL content-based course taught twice in 2003 and 2004 that integrated learners' language learning experience with language learning theories. The study investigated the effectiveness of learning both content and language in this experience-based language learning course through asynchronous discussion and also examined the reflectiveness and interactivity of the participants' online exchanges. The results showed that most of the participants held a highly positive view on this CMC learning activity. Moreover, their reflectiveness in asynchronous discussions was found to be affected more by peer interaction than by the instructor's participation. Of particular interest is that the differences found among discussion groups revealed that the higher participation level the students had, the more positive view they held. This can be well supported by Wenger's social theory of learning emphasizing the importance of active participation.",

        "description":"Under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), participating states and jurisdictions must provide services to children who are either experiencing developmental delays, or who have a diagnosed mental or physical condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay. Additionally, states may choose to serve children who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided. Eligibility criteria used by states influence the numbers and types of children receiving services, the types of services provided, and the cost of the early intervention system. This paper discusses how 50 states and 6 jurisdictions define developmental delay and, as applicable, their approaches to serving children who are at risk. It discusses the wide variability in the types of criteria states use to describe developmental delay and identifies three categories of risk for adverse developmental outcomes used by many states. These include conditions of established risk, biological/medical risk, and environmental risk. Factors that may mediate the impact of risk factors are also noted, including temperament of the child, high self-esteem, good emotional relationship with at least one parent, and successful learning experiences. Definitions related to eligibility under Part C of the IDEA Amendments of 1997 are provided.

        "description":"This document analyzes states' definition of developmental delay and analyzes current eligibility classifications and criteria used by states to identify young children in need of special education and related services. Data were obtained from states' Web sites, the National State Policy Database (2003), and/or provided by coordinators of the state Part B-Section 619 programs, including the District of Columbia. The paper describes variations among state policies in disability terminology used for young children, age ranges used by states for developmental delay, the relationship between developmental delay and other Part B categories, and eligibility criteria for developmental delay. The author concludes that states exhibit a strong interest in using the option of a developmental delay eligibility category for young children served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Four tables provide information on the following: (1) Part B Disability Categories under IDEA; (2) IDEA Regulations Related to Developmental Delay for Children Ages 3 through 9 Years; (3) Summary of State Eligibility Classifications and Criteria for Young Children under Part B of IDEA; and (4) Summary Table of Early Childhood Special Education Eligibility Criteria in the States, and the District of Columbia as of January 2004.

These are the questions we investigated in a sample of 74 students with disabilities (excluding students who only reported having a learning disability) and to 154 students without disabilities from Dawson College. The goal was to identify similarities and differences between these two groups and to start the development of a closed-ended evaluation tool. Both closed and open-ended measures were administered. Results show that while students with disabilities indicated that disability-related accommodations were the most important facilitators, for the most part these students mentioned the same facilitators as their non-disabled peers. Similarly, students with and without disabilities shared most of the same obstacles. The main difference here was that students with disabilities cited disability-related issues, such as health, as a major obstacle.

This study employed the best-evidence synthesis methodology devised by Robert Slavin. Criteria for study inclusion included germaneness, minimization of bias, and validity. This study allows for several conclusions: (1) a very limited amount of research focusing on the relationship of MI instructional approaches and student achievement indicators in secondary school classrooms exists, (2) instances of MI instructional approaches vary widely in methodology and implementation but demonstrate a fairly consistent philosophical approach, and (3) the studies included in this research synthesis failed to prove causation in the relationship of MI instructional approaches and student achievement indicators in secondary school classrooms. However, substantial evidence exists showing that multiple intelligences theory contributes positively to student learning and development. Further research is needed to quantify the relationship between MI instructional approaches and academic achievement indicators in secondary classrooms. [M.Ed. Thesis, Cedarville University.]",

Alternative education may be offered in a different location, it might use a different delivery system or educational model, or it might have a specialized curriculum. Alternative programs often demonstrate characteristic approaches to teaching and learning, school environment, and student support which are designed to meet youth needs that are not being met in the traditional school setting. For the purpose of meeting WIA performance measures, alternative education must result in: measurable gains in literacy and math skills; completion of a high school diploma or its equivalent; and successful transition to employment or postsecondary education or training.

The sample included 479 students (207 secondary/content specialists; 272 elementary/generalists: early childhood educators, special educators). Participants completed a pre and post survey instrument at entry and exit of the inclusion course.  Results indicate statistically significant differences on all pairwise comparisons of survey items measuring general dispositions toward inclusion and on items measuring dispositions toward including students with specific disability eligibility categories in the general education classroom. Preservice elementary educators were also found to have attitudes that are more favorable toward inclusion than secondary educators. A significant difference was found in comparing the level of change from pre-survey to post-survey, with preservice secondary educators reporting greater gains in favorable attitudes toward inclusion at the end of the course. Results indicate that an inclusion course can favorably impact the attitudes of preservice educator toward including students with disabilities in the general education classroom, with a greater impact on the degree of reported attitudinal change for secondary educators. Professionals involved in the preparation of preservice educators must include appropriate content that provides the types of knowledge, skills and dispositions that will assist both elementary and secondary educators in meeting the demands of the curriculum and individual needs of students with disabilities. This will include equipping educators with skills for implementing differentiated instruction. In order to fully realize the potential of inclusive education, additional research in the preparation of  preservice educators is needed within courses that deliver inclusionary practice information which investigates: (1) the effectiveness of specific competencies and/or objectives on preservice teachers' dispositions, knowledge and skills; (2) successful instructional practices utilized in the design and delivery of course(s) that have impact on educator dispositions at the elementary and secondary levels; and (3) the impact of preservice education courses on actual inclusive practices.

        "description":"Finding a competent technology leader to manage educational technology for a school district can be a daunting task. The technology director plays a vital role in the leadership of instructional technology and related services. This individual is in a position to frame out the vision and direction for how technology can be used in teaching and learning. Clearly, there are many responsibilities and talents required of this leader. In order to defuse some of the uncertainty of identifying the role of the technology director and the scope of duties for this position, a single job title should be given to all technology leaders in education because the position entails similar responsibilities and duties. Some of the main duties of school technology experts include: develop a comprehensive K-12 instructional technology plan for the district; work with faculty and administration to integrate technology into the curriculum; routinely evaluate the instructional technology program; develop the yearly technology budget; review, evaluate and purchase instructional technology resources; and work with Principals and their staffs to effectively utilize all available resources that promote the use of  technology. Sample job descriptions and interview questions are also included in the  article.

        "description":"The Pennsylvania Department of Education requires Technology Coordinators employed by public school districts in the Commonwealth to be properly certified. The Technology Coordinator is responsible to implement instructional technology for the district, provide leadership in the use of technological delivery systems, and routinely work directly with teachers and administrators to effectively integrate educational technology into the classroom. The position is considered to be professional and certified, subject to tenure provisions. This research investigates the following questions: Who are the Technology Coordinators in the Eastern Pennsylvania school districts? What skills do they perceive as important to the implementation of educational technology? What are their professional and technical backgrounds? What educational credentials do they hold? Is their orientation geared toward education or technology? Data for this study was collected from a questionnaire that was sent to district level Technology Coordinators in the eastern counties of Pennsylvania. One hundred and two districts were randomly selected from each of 24 counties. A return rate of 85.2% was received. The initial survey was reviewed and piloted by the Technology Coordinators and educational technology experts in Carbon and Lehigh Counties to ensure validity of the instrument. Since the data collected was more descriptive than predictive in nature, the statistics utilized in this study concentrated on nonparametric data testing methodologies. The statistical design for this study consisted of descriptive statistics, simple correlations and rank order. Technology experts in Eastern Pennsylvania feel that providing technical support services for the district is their primary task. Assisting educators in utilizing technology resources is the second priority. The survey respondents perceive their performance as a Technology Coordinator as being successful. They also feel that they understand the technology concerns of teachers and are having a positive effect on the professional staff. Technology Coordinators spend the majority of their time performing hardware installation and troubleshooting technology. Completing administrative paperwork and managing the network infrastructure are a close second and third as identified by the respondents.",

        "author":["Abode, Philip Sanmi"],
        "description":"The purpose of this study was to understand the nature of the relationship between organizational strategy and district performance among California's largest unified school districts. Organizational strategy was measured using planned and realized strategies (independent variables). Realized strategy is also referred to strategic orientation. Organizational strategy was determined using a questionnaire that included items about strategic plan implementation (intended strategy) and four self-typing paragraphs measuring realized strategy or strategic orientation. District performance was measured using three performance indicators as proxies for operational efficiency, product quality and program equity (dependent variables). The percentage of students in each district receiving free or reduced price lunch, proxy for student socioeconomic background was used as a covariate. The data was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results show that 75% of the district indicated implementing a current strategic plan. Districts appeared more or less evenly divided among four strategy types: prospector, defender, analyzer and reactor, with the latter two accounting for 54% of all respondents. Prospector strategy is oriented toward innovation across programs while defender strategy emphasizes maintenance and efficiency of programs. Analyzer strategy is oriented toward the maintenance of existing effective programs while seeking or developing innovative programs to serve unmet needs. Districts characterized by reactor strategy lack any consistent approach to meeting student needs and tend to respond only to external pressure. The independent variables taken together significantly explained 69% of the variance in operational efficiency and 49% of the variance in product quality. With respect to program equity, the model's result approached significance, explaining 25% of the variance. The results show that organizational strategy is an important construct for superintendents and top administrators to consider in their effort to create an effective and accountable school district. Appended are: (1) School District Strategy Survey 2004; (2) Invitation to Participate; and (3) SPSS--Multivariate Analysis of Variance Output. (Contains 12 tables and 2 figures.) [Ed.D.

Specifically, they wanted to know if students in grades 5, 8, and 11 who scored at the basic or below basic performance level on the 2003-2004 Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) received inflated end of semester grades in reading and mathematics. Data for this study were collected from the PSSA reading and mathematics assessments and the end of year report card grades for students in the 5th, 8th, and 11th grade during the 2003-2004 academic year. A total of 407 student records were examined. The researchers found no grade inflation for students in grade 5 for the combined sample of reading and math. However when the sample was split according to subject, the reading final grades were inflated. Grade inflation was also present for both grades 8 and 11 for the combined samples and for individual subjects (Reading and Math).",

However, there is evidence that even with increasing equity in achievement, inequity in other important learning outcomes might still prevail. Students' judgements of their own ability to solve tasks in Mathematics or &quot;Mathematics Self-Efficacy&quot; are often viewed as crucial learning outcomes, which affect the process of learning and are important predictors of educational career choices. The second survey of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA 2003) provides data from nationally representative data on self-related cognitions, learning behaviours and student performance in the area of Mathematics from 30 OECD and 10 non-OECD countries. This paper includes multi-level analyses of the effects of gender and student home background on the beliefs of self-efficacy and logistic regression analyses of the impact of these beliefs on general career expectations among 15-year-old students from 30 OECD countries. The results of the analyses of relationships between self-beliefs and literacy in the area of mathematics and the effects of self-efficacy on students' general career expectations largely confirm findings of earlier research and are largely consistent across OECD countries.

Through the &quot;A Learning Alberta&quot; initiative, a revised vision and new policy outcomes for Alberta's advanced education system will be articulated. The &quot;A Learning Alberta&quot; initiative has started public discussion on system-wide issues related to Alberta's development and growth as a learning society. Discussion and resource documents have been released to start dialogues on affordability, accessibility, investing, rural access, innovation, and shaping the system direction. This document focuses on obtaining stakeholder feedback on how to identify and ensure a high quality advanced education system in Alberta. It reviews Alberta's current system of quality assurance and assessment measures, proposes a framework to guide our thinking on quality in advanced education, and concludes with key questions.

        "author":["Wagman, Janet Campbell"],
        "description":"The purpose of this study was to analyze and induce change to lessen the achievement gap in heterogeneously grouped high school Latin classes where some students may be at academic risk, due to insufficient knowledge, inability to connect with the subject, and poor performances. The researcher engaged in action research, a branch of qualitative research, to determine if experiential learning methodologies, such as inquiry and research, could increase motivation, self-efficacy, and academic autonomy in two classes of Latin I students. The total number of student participants was 48, ranging from grades 9 through 11 with an even distribution between males and females and ethnicity predominantly dichotomized between students of European descent and African descent. Using the WebQuest model as the means to understand phenomena and facilitate change, the researcher created an inquiry-internet research project titled &quot;Cur Latina?&quot; The researcher recorded the participants' (teacher and students) ostensible behavior and perceptions concerning motivation, self-efficacy, and academic autonomy during their engagement in the &quot;Cur Latina?&quot; project. The researcher collected data via observations, performance assessments, a questionnaire, and interviews. The observation and performance assessment results of the study revealed that the &quot;Cur Latina?&quot; project helped students achieve competence in an interrelated area within the Latin I curriculum. Results from the questionnaire and interviews revealed that the students perceived their motivation, self-efficacy, and academic autonomy to have increased because their individual areas of expertise were integrated into the &quot;Ecce Romani&quot; Latin I textbook and would continue to be employed throughout the Latin I course. Additional results from student questionnaires and interviews revealed that many students preferred holistically presented information with knowledge building upon itself in its relation to a greater whole. Perceiving the search for connected knowledge to be a personal as well as an accomplishable task enhanced the students' academic autonomy and motivation to learn. Recommendations for further study include additional studies that would elucidate affective elements of such subjects as Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, and Old English, where the emphasis is on the written language. Qualitative studies concerning affective states of mind, such as self-efficacy, motivation, and academic autonomy, which can function as catalysts to learning in the moribund and dead language classroom, would be beneficial in discerning similarities and differences from this study in order to note confluent patterns that teachers can use to enhance language learning in their classrooms. Qualitative studies on the effectiveness of integrating inquiry learning and technology would also be beneficial to understanding learning in the moribund and dead language classroom.

        "description":"This qualitative study provides a phenomenological perspective and comparative analysis of character education within the Christian school and home education milieu. The study is based on semi-structured interviews of fifty-two individuals (N = 52) representative of a sampling of Christian educators from four private, evangelical Christian Schools (n = 26) and area home educating families (n = 26). The intent of the researcher was to bring attention to the importance for Christian educators to come to terms with the worldview from which the desire to educate Christian youth in a separate moral community originates. Although the purpose and intent of both sets of educators were in many instances similar, significant deviations in methodology and application were found. The results of this study are defined in four similarities and six differences, suggesting that character education and the juxtaposition of that goal along with the transference of faith was a major contributor to the obvious commitment and calling felt by Christian educators.

        "description":"Are today's undergraduates getting more for their money, given the rising costs of higher education? Based on student perceptions, this report offers a mixed response. In the areas that matter most to students--the quality of instruction and academic advising--student satisfaction has not changed noticeably over the past five years. Yet students today are more satisfied with certain aspects of their experience, including their course registration experiences and the adequacy of computer labs and libraries. This report highlights areas of the college experience where student satisfaction is up, where it has held steady, and where it is down. Unique to this report, the findings shown first are those that matter most to students, followed by findings that matter less to them. Findings in this report are based on a comparison of national student satisfaction survey data gathered during the 2004-2005 academic year compared with national data on identical survey items gathered during the 1999-2000 academic year. The data were judged to be representative and statistically significant in size. In 2004-2005, the data sample included 226,432 students from 425 institutions. In 1999-2000, the sample included 235,786 students from 510 institutions. Both samples included a mix of two-year, four-year, public and private institutions.",

The competency component operates on the basis of a comparison with peers. This comparison may lead to a big-fish-little-pond (BFLP) effect. To investigate the sustainability of the BFLP effect, a sample of 7th graders from 6 classes in a high school in China was surveyed on both the competency and affect components of school self-concept (N = 297) at the beginning, in the middle and by the end of grade 7 and compared across 4 groups categorised according to their high school entrance exam scores. Analysis of variance results showed that the highest scoring students had the highest self-concept of competency and the scores remained high throughout the year of 7th grade. In essence, the &quot;big fish&quot; remained big and the &quot;small fish&quot; remained small, and the pattern was consistent over time. The scores for the component of affect did not differ across groups, became slightly higher in mid-year, and remained high throughout the year. Instead of attempting to promote a positive affect in schooling, there seems to be a stronger need for enhancing a sense of competency in the &quot;smaller fish&quot;. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Intuitively, teacher competencies and their perceived needs of retraining should be negatively correlated. However, the correlations between teacher competencies and perceived needs were found to be small and mostly not statistically significant. Teachers at various stages of their professional development were found to have varying competencies but they tended to have very similar needs. The results suggested that neither an analysis of the current teacher competencies nor that of their perceived needs alone would be adequate to guide the consideration of the contents of curriculum for in-service teachers. Instead, the teachers' current stage of professional development should be seriously considered in order to provide them with the most appropriate in-service training program. (Contains 3 tables.)",

In contrast, when gifted students are grouped with non-gifted students, a sepia (blackening) effect may operate. However, recent theories have also shown a big-fish-little-pond (BFLP) effect resulting from comparison. Four groups of primary students (N = 757) were placed into 3 classes. Class 1 had gifted students from Group 1. Class 2 had Group 2 (gifted) and Group 3 (average) students placed together. Average students of Group 4 were placed in class 3. When a gifted program for classes 1 and 2 started, Groups 1 and 2 (the big fish) had higher self-concept than Group 4 (the small fish) but Group 2 did not score higher than Group 3. One year later, whereas Groups 1 and 2 remained higher than Group 4, Group 2 scored higher than Group 3. Initially, there was a strong blackening effect for the big fish in Group 2, but a strong BFLP effect operated later. The results cast doubt on the provision of gifted programs where gifted students are pulled out from the regular classroom. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)",

The present study has two purposes: (a) to examine whether parent-child relations would influence low achievers' liking of school, and (b) to investigate whether low achievers' parent-child relations and liking of school could be improved through a focused intervention emphasizing interpersonal skills. Using a confirmatory factor analysis approach, the path from prior self-concept of parent relationship to subsequent self-concept of academic affect were examined using a sample of students who failed in the school system of Hong Kong but were provided with further education opportunities through an innovative program known as Project Yi Jin initiated by the Special Administrative Region government of Hong Kong (N = 2,779). Controlled for the effect of prior academic affect, prior parent-child relations were found to have a significant, though small, association with subsequent academic affect. The results supported the positive influence of parent-child relations on children's liking of school. Analysis of variance of pretest and posttest scores showed that as a result of a program emphasizing the development of interpersonal skills, the students improved in both parent-child relations and liking of school. The findings have important implications for a holistic approach to children's education by incorporating parent education as an important component of the education system.

Student performance in the earlier grades has shown great promise for the following years. Growth in fluency and comprehension in grades 2 and 3 were not as impressive and require additional attention. The assessment results were triangulated by observations in the classrooms, interviews, and teacher responses to professional development- teachers know how to teach PA and the alphabetic principle but were still struggling with finding time and effective strategies for fluency, comprehension strategies, and self monitoring. Growing gaps for SPED, Ethnic minorities, and ELL students suggest an emphasis on the secondary and tertiary levels of intervention in the schools. (Contains 11 figures and 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Research during the past decade suggests that integrating computing technology in general, and mobile computers in particular, into the educational environment has positive effects. This is the first long-term study of high school Personal Digital Assistant use. It involved three-parts, 146 students during four years. Part one found that PDA use improves grade point average by 13%. Part two found PDA participatory simulations are effective teaching tools, improving biology test scores by 24%. The first PDA intelligent tutoring software was written for part three and found to improve algebra test scores. Results illustrate potential of large-scale PDA implementations and support PDA purchases with No Child Left Behind Act funding. The improvement resulting from PDAs, available at one-tenth the price of laptops, is greater than the achievement increase found by the Rockman (1998) study of laptop computers. Data suggests a reallocation of technology budgets to PDAs will statistically significantly improve high school student academic achievement. (Contains 8 tables and 4 graphs.)",

        "description":"A positive correlation has been found between laptops and student achievement. Laptops are similar to Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) in many respects. This study seeks to determine the effect of PDA usage on high school student academic achievement. It was hypothesized that a positive correlation between PDA usage and academic achievement in general exists. Thirty-seven randomly selected students from the Millburn High School classes of 2006 and 2007 were given PDAs. Academic achievement, as measured by grade point average, of PDA-enabled students was observed for a five-month period and compared to the general student population. This process was repeated four times. A statistically significant correlation was found between the PDA-enabled students and their academic achievement when compared to the general student population. In a second study, a PDA participatory simulation was created and tested. It was found to be a statistically significant teaching tool. The improvement resulting from PDAs, available at one-tenth the price of laptops, is greater than the achievement increase found by the Rockman (1998) study of laptop computers. Therefore, a significant reallocation of educational technology purchases from laptops to PDAs may be warranted. Future work includes incorporating the learning style variable into the study.

        "author":["Dobson, Ian R."],
        "description":"The recent Government inquiry into student income support noted that there was &quot;conclusive evidence that the income support system is in a serious state of disrepair and that nothing short of a major policy review and overhaul of the system is required&quot;. The report of the inquiry produced 15 common sense recommendations, but Government senators registered their dissent to eight of them. The main scheme is called &quot;Youth Allowance&quot;, and the majority of recipients are university students aged up to 24 years. There are two basic problems with Youth Allowance. First, the strict regime of means testing rules out most students (including students of very limited financial means). Most students are assessed for eligibility on their family's income and assets. If combined parental annual income exceeds a modest $28,500, the student's benefits are reduced by $1 for every $4 earned above that limit. To be assessed on one's own means, a student must be declared as &quot;independent&quot;. It is all but impossible to be declared &quot;independent&quot; for at least 18 months after finishing secondary school. Second, the base amount paid to recipients is too low. Students eligible for the maximum payment face a poverty gap of over $100 per week. Many eligible students receive considerably less than the maximum. The Government refuses to release figures on the proportion of university students receiving less than the full amount. What is worse is that students are permitted to earn only $118 per week in addition to Youth Allowance before being penalized. This one aspect of Youth Allowance is not indexed against inflation, and in 2005 the additional earnings limit remained at the level it was in 1993. With indexation, the permitted additional earnings limit would have been $160 per week. As a consequence, many students work for cash payments in the black economy (predominantly in the hospitality industry). By earning more than the permitted maximum in the cashier of student income support (the first for 16 years) was funded privately, because the Government refused to it. That survey showed that many more full-time students are now in paid employment during semester, and that they work many hours more (on average) that had been the case in the mid 1980s.

        "author":["Georgiou, Andreas"],
        "description":"This study is part of a larger research agenda, which includes future doctoral study, aiming to investigate the psychological processes of thought experiments. How do thought-experimenters establish relations between their imaginary worlds and the physical one? How does a technique devoid of new sensory input result to new empirical knowledge? In this study I investigate the following claims as possible answers: that intuition grounds the behaviour of an imaginary scenario in the experienced world; and that imagistic simulation provides the thought-experimenter with a quasi-perceptual analogue to direct perception through which they acquire novel empirical knowledge. Case methodology was adopted, the case being a pair of final year A-level physics students. Data was collected through non-participant observation over two sessions of collaborative problem-solving. The tasks drew upon Newtonian mechanics. A certain type of thought-experimental reasoning prevailed in the observation protocol. These thought experiments do not aim to induce unexpected results but to make intuitions about a situation experiencable in a concrete (imaginary) scenario. I interpret thought experiments of this type as a mental analogue to inductive discovery through physical experiment. A critical question for future research is whether all thought-experimental reasoning in general emulates physical experimentation, as the answer will potentially provide insights for exploring thought experimenting as an educable skill.

A major concern has been to establish and maintain the consistency of its academic offerings at all campuses as the College expands. Building on a pre- posttesting mechanism long in place, the College is now technologically equipped to assess campus programs in terms of student learning gains and to compare these results across campuses in an effort to maintain program equivalency. The session will be used to describe and discuss the workings of this process. Over the last twenty years, accountability demands by state and federal policymakers, accreditors, and other higher education stakeholders have steadily increased. These demands focus ever more sharply on the assessment of student learning outcomes. This increased external pressure has moved institutions to look for novel ways to collect assessment data and to use it for program improvement. For multi-campus institutions, program equivalency becomes an issue. Keiser College has developed a process of standardized pre- and post-testing across campuses while delivering instruction in a time-intensive scheduling format. This process enables comparison of program results at multiple locations. Other multi-campus institutions may benefit from discussion of the details of this process.",

Non-completion has been related to all sorts of social, financial, and psychological issues. Many studies have attempted to put together a process that will identify students at risk of dropping out by using various research methodologies. The purpose of this study is to investigate correlates of high school dropping out through the use of data mining of existing data sources with decision trees. Decision tree methods are designed to sift through a set of predictor variables and successively split a data set into subgroups in order to improve the prediction  (classification) of a target (dependent) variable. As such, these methods are valuable to data miners faced with constructing predictive models when there may be a large number of predictor variables and not much theory or previous work to guide them. The tree presented in this paper does exhibit a certain ability to predict which students may drop out of school.",

        "description":"A number of forces have increased the momentum for school districts to develop district-wide reform strategies as a means of initiating and sustaining school improvement. First, districts have sometimes found it easier to manage and support a single districtwide initiative rather than many different school reform models. Second, they have come to recognize that some educational problems, such as high student mobility, are better addressed above the level of individual schools. Finally, new standards of accountability, including requirements in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, have created an audience for new ideas about the appropriate role of districts in spearheading reform. The Bay Area School Reform Collaborative (BASRC), located in San Francisco, California (and known now as Springboard Schools), is a grant-making organization that supports districts' efforts to improve the quality and equity of student outcomes. BASRC's &quot;focal strategy&quot; is a district-level reform strategy being implemented in six districts throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Emphasizing process rather than particular approaches, the focal strategy relies on three key features: coaching of district and school leaders; evidence-based decision-making throughout the system; and networking within and across schools to share experiences and lessons. This report suggests that the BASRC focal strategy is not associated with districtwide improvements in average elementary student achievement. While there is the hint of a relationship between participation in the focal strategy and improved performance among lower-achieving, disadvantaged students, the differences tend to be small and are not statistically significant. Moreover, any relationship that exists appears to be limited to the upper elementary grades.",

        "description":"In 1994, Baldwin-Wallace College produced a Strategic Plan for Information Technology. This plan mandated changes in the influx of technology, the structure of IT, and technology committees. The published plan included the organizational structure of the College, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats), ten proposed strategies with accompanying initiatives, specifications for campus networks and systems, an equipment inventory, and various appendices. As a result of the plan an Information Technology Strategic Planning Committee (ITSPC) was formed. The ITSPC met regularly and technology issues were discussed; however, the plan was not reviewed annually or updated. This paper presents a brief overview of the developmental history of this Strategic Plan since 1994. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

        "description":"Reading with a pencil in hand to mark-up a book or article, scribbling questions and notes (along with rude drawings in some cases) in the margins of a committee meeting agenda, marking a student's essay with a red pen--all of these are everyday activities for most faculty. It is hard to say exactly how much of what we do can be defined as reading or writing because we are always engaging in both, simultaneously and seamlessly. But our behavior suddenly changes when we sit down in front of a PC. Suddenly, reading and writing become discrete activities, separated from one another both mentally and technologically. The screen is for reading. The keyboard is for writing. But what if there were a way to integrate reading and writing on the computer. What kinds of hardware and software would be needed? This article analyzes this possible teaching method, discussing two software programs for graphic annotation of documents using graphic tablets: Adobe Acrobat and Meander's Annotator.

        "author":["Christo-Baker, Elizabeth Anne"],
        "description":"Whereas distance education was formerly on the periphery of education and in the realm of institutions with questionable academic credentials, it has been gradually gaining acceptance, is becoming mainstreamed, and is being embraced by traditional universities. The use of distance technologies is challenging the traditional structures of higher education institutions and it has been predicted that distance education technologies will precipitate changes in existing organizational models. This is not an unexpected outcome, as changes in technology precipitate changes in work relationships and in the way output is produced. The exact form that universities of the future will take in response to these changes is uncertain. This paper discusses distance education in the light of the challenges that it poses to higher education and its role as a driver of structural and cultural change. Emergent models and possible future directions will also be explored. The primary focus of this paper will be online or Internet based distance education. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

        "description":"Computer Science and related majors have seen a decrease in enrollment across the country in recent years. While there are several theories behind why this may be the case, as educators in many areas of computing and information technology, this is a trend we should attempt to reverse. While it is true that many children are \"computer literate\", their knowledge of subjects actually relating to the computing sciences is often limited. The authors feel that exposing younger children (those of elementary school age) to computing topics may help to increase their interest in these subjects as they mature. Thus, they may be more likely to choose computing majors when they go to college. At the start of the 2003-2004 academic year, the officers of the authors' local ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) student chapter \"brain stormed\" for ideas as to how they could expand the  visibility of their organization on campus and in the surrounding community. Several of their   group members had worked in the past with regional and national organizations that provide  educational science camps for gifted youth. It was decided that a similar event could be conducted on the authors' campus for local elementary and middle school age children. This paper discusses the specifics of the camps, including the content of the courses and how they were advertised in the community. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

Planning relies on providing access, 'Anytime Anywhere' to student information, calendar, email, course management tools, and the Intranet to improve services and support to students, faculty, and staff. Eight strategies form the framework of our plan: (1) Student services drive project priorities; (2) Administrative support leads to technology innovation; (3) Teamwork builds on collaborative decision-making; (4) Innovation relies on informed research; (5) Adaptations evolve as technology changes; (6) Standards determine purchasing; (7) Projects are phased-in according to specified timelines; and (8) Communication promotes successful implementation. Planning is initiated, explored, and promoted through members of the Technology Learning Roundtable, Academic and Administrative departments, and Information Technology Services. Implementation and maintenance of a highly reliable technology enriched campus focuses on resources, training, support, innovation, and communication. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

Often they are used as the principal means of web-based course delivery. In addition, many institutions are utilizing CMSs to more economically handle large sections of particular courses. However, CMSs can also be used as a valuable tool for supplementing face-to-face course instruction. Although we have used a CMS extensively in large sections of lower-level courses, we have not, until now, made a concentrated effort at examining the effect of using a CMS in our upper-level computer science programming courses. This paper will focus on the pedagogical uses of a CMS and the specific aspects of a CMS that seem to either contribute to or detract from student learning. We also explore the features we would like to employ in the future that may increase student motivation and success for our computer science students.  [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

This process addresses the issues of what each student needs to learn in his or her program of study and if each student is learning what they need to learn. The assessment program at Columbus State Community College has four specific and interrelated purposes: (1) to improve student academic achievement; (2) to improve teaching strategies; (3) to document successes and identify opportunities for program improvement; and (4) to provide evidence for institutional effectiveness. The Computer Information Technology (CIT) department at Columbus State is actively engaged in studying and implementing \"best practices\" in assessing students in technical programs. Responding to workforce needs requires that our students are evaluated according to the specific standards currently in use in their particular field. This presentation will discuss assessment practices beneficial to technical programs such as ours and will focus on standardized assessment practices such as program rubrics, quizzes, tests, and assignments, as well as the meta-cognitive techniques of student self assessment, minute papers, etc. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

        "description":"The Portable and Mobile Classroom (PortMoC) began as an idea to bring Internet connectivity to places where there was no connectivity for education and healthcare, but still make the connection reasonably sustainable in terms of cost and manpower. Through trial and error and several research iterations, Saint Francis University's Center of Excellence for Remote and Medically Under-Served Areas (CERMUSA) finally settled upon a tow-behind-style trailer combining a small form factor with a satellite dish, self-contained power and IP distribution, and 802.11b standard laptop computers. The PortMoC has gone through several iterations, including physical vehicles. However, the research approach has been the same: Does this technology work as we intended and is it a viable means to education? CERMUSA has surveyed the technology, such as upload/download speeds and laptop Internet connections, and is looking to roll this out into real-world situations. As it stands currently, the average download speed is 385 Kbs and the upload speed is 14 Kbs, with 8 laptops receiving separate low-bandwidth video streams. Items for future research and discussion are: Is it possible to raise the download/upload speeds for the benefit of the students while keeping the costs down? What applications are appropriate to use in the PortMoC environment? [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

Excel provides a broad array of fundamental tools but often comes up short when more sophisticated scenarios are involved. To overcome this short-coming of Excel while retaining its ease of use, I will describe how MATLAB's Excel-Builder converts MATLAB functions into Excel macros. The add-ins can be freely distributed and operate solely from Excel. To demonstrate the utility of add-ins, I will describe a project that I am currently working on in Excel that could be enhanced with the add-ins to carry out more sophisticated scenarios.

These faculty members would handle the implementation of technology and bring it into the classroom by themselves, with only a small amount of outside support. This evolved into faculty members who were comfortable with technology (but not early adopters) using more and more technology in the classroom with increasing outside support from IT staff and other faculty. What is happening now is that faculty members who are not comfortable with technology, or who are even technophobes, are using technology in increasing ways in the classroom. For this paper and presentation, the focus will be on a particular faculty member, Dr. Svetlana  Rakic. Svetlana is an Art Professor, who has written several books over various art topics. Svetlana was comfortable with basic email and Internet usage, but did not have a lot of experience with other software and hardware tools. In this case, she realized that slide images were the way of the past, and wanted to branch out into digital images for her class presentations. She was unhappy with the poor quality of the slide images, and did not like carrying around huge slide trays for each class. This situation opened the doors to new opportunities for using technology, but also had some problems associated with it. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

Because of this effort, the tutorials became a 2003 Microsoft Model Professional Development Award recipient. Since our last meeting, the Office 2003 tutorials have been created, and are available, through the website. One of our ASCUE members, Bernadette Ortiz-Brewster, is translating the tutorials into Spanish. Karen Fraser of Hendrix College, Arkansas is MACing the tutorials. Several other ASCUE members have also published tutorials, from their institutions, on this website. Currently, a Microsoft Producer tutorial is being created. As this is being written, the tutorials are being considered by the National Forum on Information Literacy, the Department of the Navy Information Literacy Toolkit, the Virginia Department of Education, and the Teaching, Learning, Technology Roundtable.

        "description":"While the author was completing his doctorate in music education, part of his workload as a graduate assistant included observing student teachers. One of the requirements of the Education College was for each student teacher to create a digital portfolio of his or her work. The students were to author web pages containing examples of their work in the classroom, their teaching philosophy, a short bio, and a resume. Unfortunately, very few of the students had the skill or experience to author web pages. While there was a \"Portfolio Boot Camp\" that each of the students was to attend, in which they were given a crash course on using \"Dreamweaver,\" the limited experience combined with the student teachers' limited schedules allowed very few of the students to ever get past an index page, much less to the point of having a viable product that any future employer could look at. The author wondered if there was a better way to create a digital record of student work that could be easily accessed by future employers. This paper attempts to answer this question and proposes a new option for the digital student teaching portfolio that overcomes many of the challenges inherent in Internet portfolios.

        "author":["Pollack, Thomas A."],
        "description":"As recently as the 1999-2000 academic year, the most sought after graduates were those completing degree requirements in a wide variety of information systems based programs. Many graduates were enticed by lucrative signing bonuses as organizations prepared for the dreaded uncertainty of Y2K. Information systems and computer science programs and courses were in great demand as most students wanted to demonstrate that they had developed significant competency in using computers and understanding the value of information systems. This paper will examine the impact of today's offshore outsourcing movement. It will also include a discussion of the potential impact on education programs as a result of a decreased number of entry level career opportunities and a commensurate decline in interest in information systems education.

        "description":"The IT 3050 course at Capella University is an introduction to fundamental computer networking. This course is one of the required courses in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program. In order to provide a more enriched learning environment for learners, Capella has significantly modified this class (and others) by infusing it with interactive tools and web-based resources. Students report a more enhanced learning experience, which should result in many positive results for both the University and the learners (and, by extension, their employers). The following discussion provides a more detailed look into these changes. The course has evolved from an online discussion-based approach to an online discussed-based approach infused with a wealth of interactive tools and web-based resources. First, the Network+ Virtual Lab software is required and learners report that this tool enhances their learning by providing a realistic hands-on experience. In addition, many Net-based resources are utilized, including downloadable software learners then install and evaluate. The combination of these features provides a more interactive and hands on class, therefore providing the learner with a \"real world\" environment. Thus, there is a significant value added effect present. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

In that paper we examined the need for &quot;soft-skills&quot; by information technology professionals. In the current economic climate, IT outsourcing is becoming increasingly popular. Our Columbus, Indiana Purdue campus has a long history of partnerships with Cummins Inc. In the past two years we have worked with Cummins to develop the Business/Systems Analyst Training program to retool valued IT professionals at Cummins. The focus is on turning Cummins from a traditional IT organization into one that is increasingly based on dealing with offshore outsourcing. The skills required in-house will focus more on the &quot;soft-skills&quot; as Cummins transitions employees from programming to business/system analyst positions. Since presenting our paper last year we have delivered two sessions of the Business/Systems Analyst Training. In this paper we will provide an update with feedback from participants, management and faculty. How effective was the training? Is this a program that other universities can emulate? We will explore those and other issues in this paper. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

Nine faculty participants attended a week long workshop session in June 2003 taught by three mentors. At the end of the workshop series, the participants submitted a project plan that was reviewed, critiqued, and approved by the mentors. During the summer, the faculty developed the proposed project with guidance from the mentors. In September 2003, the group met and presented their projects to their peers and evaluated the program. The 3M's program was considered to be a success by both the participants and the mentors; however, changes need to be made to improve future offerings.

The Exit from Program Portfolio for Initial Preparation Programs, the third and final benchmark for completion of the licensure program, is based on the ten INTASC standards and is designed to maximize candidate reflection on teaching and learning during the first of two eight-week student teaching placements. During the first year of the pilot (2002-2003), volunteer candidates used Dreamweaver 4 to create e-portfolios. Though all pilot candidates were successful in completing the benchmark, problems arose with teaching and using Dreamweaver, and a determination was made that more user friendly software should be used. In the second year, candidates used Lectora software published by Trivantis Corporation. Software instruction was easier, but additional problems arose when Lectora was not available as promised for the Macintosh platform. Issues remain as full implementation for all candidates is scheduled to begin during the 2004-2005 school year. Sample portfolios will be demonstrated and additional questions concerning E-portfolios will be raised in the session. [For complete proceedings, see ED490093.]",

Using this medium, however, prospects are able to do their research independently and privately, without having to contact the institution via phone, mail or email to make a formal inquiry. Consequently, many potential inquiries, applicants and students are nameless, faceless web visitors whom recruitment personnel generally have no way of contacting or pursuing with their typical follow-up process. Using Groopz e-commerce software, recruitment staff can overcome this disadvantage by monitoring usage of their web sites and proactively or reactively contacting web visitors. Using this \"instant message\"-style communication tool, they are able to take online customer service to new levels. In many cases, it allows a staff member to engage in conversation with a casual passer-by, resulting in new recruitment opportunities. Since implementing Groopz on the Philadelphia Biblical University web site, countless visitors, who otherwise may have remained nameless and faceless, have turned into formal inquiries, applicants and students.

A challenge for instructors in an on-line setting is to insure that students are learning from their textbooks. One way to address this challenge is to use productivity software tools to develop assignments that promote student thinking and interaction with course content. This paper gives examples and directions of activities that are easy to design and relatively easy to grade, but require thought on the part of the students to complete. The assignments are based on graphic organizers discussed in K-12 reading methods textbooks such as those by Gunning (2004) and Vacca & Vacca (2005). Graphic organizers are typically designed for students to complete using paper and pencil. With slight modifications, higher education faculty can design challenging assignments based on graphic organizers that can be distributed to students and completed by students electronically.

During the Spring 2005 semester we used Camtasia[TM] to record both image and voice for instructional use outside the classroom. Our goal was to reach every student member of our campus and educate them on the offerings available in the library. Selected faculty received a CD tailored to their specific needs in the library. We used previous bibliographic instruction records to select the initial group of educators for the CD system. The library intends to provide this type of resource for any faculty member based on their feedback and their needs. Students who are skilled in assessing and exploring their informational needs and defining what type of information will benefit their needs are well on their way to academic success. Using Camtasia[TM] we are able to reach the USC Sumter community in a familiar format. Using the technology available in the library we will create a classroom setting to begin Fall 2005, which will allow participants to attend scheduled classes to aid in discovering the technology available and will provide assistance in navigating through the vast amount of information available.

The prototype was divided into two distinct divisions. The first portion of the prototype consisted of verifying that the access points were located in optimal  locations on the SFU campus. Previous wireless prototypes consisted of doing base wiring of the SFU campus. The second current portion of the prototype consisted of wiring the greenspaces of the campus, and testing \"leaky wire\" antenna technology as a viable option for indoor wiring applications. For the 2003-2004 funding year, the testing of the greenspaces on the SFU campus was the main thrust of the research. Additionally, experiments were done with various wireless technologies.

Employees usually are divided into end-user, IT people, and management. There is a need to teach classes in information systems directly related to the progress of the human as the most important component in any information system. The class invites the students to examine themselves as employees in an ever-changing field. The class attempts to relate many topics to the study of information systems. Students' feedback and input are encouraged at the beginning of the class to form the list of topics to be covered. These may include creativity, critical thinking, obstacles to learning found in one's self or the environment, the difficulty in maintaining a productive relationship in the workplace, impact of the global market on IT, and cultural difference and appreciation, among many. Experienced people were invited as guest speakers. Based on the feedback from the students over the last few years, this class is much needed to position us, as humans, as the most important building block in any information system and, as a result, the rewards to the students have been phenomenal.

        "description":"At present, with new technologies emerging daily and the growing need for more flexibility in  scheduling, there seems to be an overall drive towards the need for distance learning. According to PBS Campus, 67% of colleges and universities agree that online education is a critical, longterm strategy for their institution. As a result, 49% of public colleges and universities and 34% of all higher education institutions offer complete online degree programs (PBS Campus, 2004). In addition, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, \"in the 12-month 2000-2001 academic year, there were an estimated 3,077,000 enrollments in all distance education courses offered by 2-year and 4-year institutions. There were an estimated 2,876,000 enrollments in college-level, credit-granting distance education courses, with 82 percent of these at the undergraduate level\" (Waits & Lewis, 2003, p. 1). The fundamental premise of distance learning was to create and widen access to education and to improve its quality, using distance education techniques and associated technologies to meet the particular requirements of individuals who were unable to participate in the traditional classroom environment. The purpose of this paper is to explore factors related to common misconceptions about distance learning, including: faculty preparation time, effective use of appropriate technology, learning styles of students, the need for orientation, training and support, and cost.

        "description":"With the ever-changing nature of hardware and software, academic IT departments have a large dilemma--constantly changing with the current direction of the prevailing wind (Considering emerging technologies, certifications, private academic institutions and expense), or to maintain traditional courses of study based in teaching theoretical concepts, while adopting some of the newer technologies. Other considerations are that IT changes can't happen overnight and that there is administrative red-tape with which to contend; additionally, sometimes there is resistance to change from established faculty who don't wish to expend the time and energy to learn newer technologies. Furthermore, Two-year college IT departments must constantly evaluate High School curricula and articulations with traditional four-year colleges so a fit is made for the student, whether it is a two-year graduate who wants to enter or re-enter the workforce, a student who wants to complete an undergraduate degree, or one currently in IT who wants to learn new skills. Our paper and presentation will consider the above questions and will discuss what academic changes should occur in academic IT, what should stay the same, and how these departments can effect the changes necessary to survive, while also considering what possible steps can be taken to alleviate the significant strain constant change puts on faculty and resources.

The author discusses an innovative format she designed for journal entries that revolutionized her field experience supervision practices and those of other supervisors with whom she has shared this format. It has vastly improved the quality of the teacher-candidate's classroom experiences as well as the depth and quality of their reflections. Now, journal entries are distinguished, thoughtful, and sharply focused on the themes and domains involved in becoming an exemplary teacher. This paper describes this innovative journaling format that is driven by identified domains such as: becoming an instructional leader, becoming an expert in a school context, becoming a learning theorist, becoming a curriculum designer as well as becoming a master practitioner. Sections in the paper include: (1) Student Teacher Journaling; (2) Teaching Domains; (3) Reflective Email Journal Assignment; (4) Rubric for Reflective Email Journal Entries; and (5) Reflective Email Journal Sample.

With a focus on the incorporation of  technology into the curriculum the laptop program has been embraced by the campus since its inception in the fall of 2000. In 2003 a new campus strategic plan identified the need to improve communication, develop a spirit of cooperation, create an easer way to solve problems, and instill respect and innovation between faculty, staff, and students. The authors desire the institution to be perceived as transparent, helpful, and supportive and they concluded that technology could assist them in reaching this goal. With this in mind they began to look at solutions that would combine, link, and create interactions with various functional areas on campus utilizing our existing technological infrastructure. The solution they felt would best serve these needs was to revamp their intranet and develop a portal that would facilitate collaboration and improve communication.

What started out as a single computer in a classroom has evolved into a laptop or handheld for every student, with a wireless connection to the Internet and other network resources. Cell phones, PDAs, and other electronic tools have opened up new horizons for utilizing technology in the classroom to better educate students. With these advancements have also come the inevitable drawbacks. With ubiquitous connections to the outside world, students have even more resources to share information, knowledge, and work with each other. These same connections also allow students to access unprecedented means for plagiarism and cheating. Today's students are in a \"always connected\" or \"always on\" mode where they have access to many different methods of communication. On most college campuses, there is an ever-present wireless network that students can use to access Internet resources. Students also use cellphones, PDAs, and PIMs to converse and communicate. With these different ways of communicating, they have the responsibility to use these resources wisely. Many times, students continue to use these tools during class time, even though they should be focusing on class work. The larger issue is using these communication devices during a test or quiz. How do educators keep students from sharing questions and answers? [For complete proceedings, see ED490133.]",

While the specific numbers have varied from study to study, there is general agreement among researchers that people retain approximately 20% of what they hear, 40% of what they see and hear, and 75% of what they see, hear, and do (Amthor, 1996).

However, reports of trends at the end of 2004 indicated that job postings for IT workers reached their highest levels since 2001. This occurs at a time when the number of four year degree programs in IT has increased while the students interested in studying IT has decreased. The consensus among many recruiters is that there is a general lack of interest in pursuing an IT degree, and this will lead to shortages in qualified IT professionals. This paper will examine the future of our technology-related educational programs as well as the projected employment prospects in the IT field.

Historically, testing in computer education has taken the form of pencil and paper or standardized testing. The actual computer skills of the student have not been properly assessed. With SAM, the testing strategy is to place a student in front of a computer with the relevant software and see if he can complete the required tasks in a limited time. The student will receive the task to be completed, with the application software running live on the computer. The computer contains all of the files needed to perform each task. The student stores his answers on the computer to be graded, and the exam is then graded based on the instructor's criteria. Since the exams are task-based, this method of testing has a high degree of validity. [For complete proceedings, see ED490133.]",

These findings are among the highlights of this new report on the attitudes of American first-year students at the beginning of their college experience. Also among the highlights: almost half to two-thirds of these students would like--right from the start--to receive help in areas such as career guidance and improving math skills. This new national study reveals that today's entering undergraduates are arriving on campuses highly motivated to complete their college degrees. Yet at the same time, many are bringing with them serious doubts about the adequacy of their academic preparation and their ability to afford college costs.   This mixture of sentiments is--perhaps not surprisingly--also accompanied by students' strong interest in receiving immediate assistance from their college, including help with preparing for college exams, career guidance, math tutoring, and assistance with securing loans and part-time jobs.",

It was a collaborative partnership involving the Rockford Public Schools, Rock Valley College, and Northern Illinois University to provide extensive professional development for teachers with the primary goal to improve secondary student achievement in MST. Following professional development, teachers conducted classroom research. All staff development models, program content, process, tools, problems and issues, research and evaluation results are provided for 7 years; teachers participated in MSTE (English) teams; full text and data is available at the website www.strategicalliance.niu.edu. The American Association of Higher Education published the book in CD format; since then, the organization has disbanded; permission was granted to have the full text available on the NIU website and in ERIC. Primary chapters include literature reviews to date of publication. The document is intended to serve as a complete professional development resource with a variety of tools. Many voices provide perspectives across its chapters. The primary program scope is fully described and content revealed as well as other workshop content, e.g. student performance assessment, teaching models are  primary development areas; additional workshops to move teachers towards technology and inherent mathematics/sciences, e.g. Astronomy and Navigation, GIS, etc. The research design, methodology, analysis, and results are  provided.

The Commission was to be a national effort, unprecedented both in scope and in the freedom of its director, Kerr, to guide its research and productivity. Carnegie President Alan Pifer promised substantial funding for five years or more. Working with Pifer, and with Alden Dunham, David Robinson, and others, Kerr initiated a great array of studies and provided recommendations on the most vital issues facing American higher education in the latter part of the twentieth century. This essay reviews the origins of the  Commission, its successor organization, the Carnegie Council, and the influence of a  number of major reports. The essay also notes the need to revisit the work of the commission and council as a source of ideas relevant today, and suggests that there is a need for a greater national approach to supporting US higher education.",

Successful student assimilation may depend upon the accuracy of an established curriculum that appropriately adapts to a flexible teaching and learning environment, in which both instructor and student benefit. Furthermore, the students' cultural orientation and home community socio-influences become problematic for a historically White, middle class, monocultural teacher who lacks adequate diversity training techniques. Preparation requires multicultural training, one in which teachers do not perceive students of color with views of low academic expectations. Therefore, multicultural educational course design must account for the stereotype, ethical, and racial myths that abound throughout the education system.",

It is motivated by the realization that language policy and practice in this region, like many other parts of the world significantly impacted by outside contact, rarely align. This is especially evident in contexts where demands for English have already established themselves and an increasingly global agenda of schools as a primary support to the process of modernization and marketing of the nation-state is firmly in place. Drawing on an example of language policy review from the Republic of the Marshall  Islands (RMI), we consider community expectations through various perspectives of local stakeholders as shared in public discussion of language issues in Pacific education. The review raises difficult questions brought into play when persuasive globalizing forces that stress the need to learn English come in contact with a more context-oriented language agenda at home.",

Rita wants to help her students develop better retelling strategies. She knows practice will improve their ability to think critically and increase their level of comprehension, language development, and the awareness of story structure.

As she sits with her students during the literacy block, she realizes some of them are having difficulty comprehending text, and many are unable to retell the stories they've just read or listened to. Rita wants to help her students develop better retelling strategies. She knows practice will improve their ability to think critically and increase their level of comprehension, language development, and the awareness of story structure. Recently, she has been reading some professional journals focused on comprehension through retelling and is eager to try teaching retelling in new ways.

        "author":["Harris, Linda"],
        "description":"In May 2000, the United States Department of Labor awarded sizable Youth Opportunity (YO)  Grants to 36 high-poverty urban, rural, and Native American communities. These communities were among the most economically distressed communities in the nation, all characterized by high drop out rates, high youth unemployment rates, greater incidence of juvenile crime, violence, and gang activity. The Youth Opportunity Grants--ranging from $3.1 to $43.8 million over five years--provided the resources to put in place comprehensive approaches at considerable scale. The Department's expressed intent in awarding these grants was to demonstrate that the educational outcomes and economic prospects for  young people in high-poverty communities could be dramatically improved by infusing these communities with resources; building capacity and infrastructure; connecting systems; and developing comprehensive, age-appropriate opportunities for youth. The observations in this paper are based on the responses of 22 of the YO sites to a &quot;Learning from Youth Opportunity&quot; survey administered by the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), wherein respondents were asked to identify areas of strength and challenges on 120 items in four categories: (1) Mobilizing and Engaging Leadership; (2) Connecting Systems; (3) Implementing Comprehensive Program Strategies; and (4) Engaging the Business Sector.  Focus group discussions were conducted with several of the YO sites shortly after the start of the final grant year and then again as the year ended. This paper presents an assessment of the capacity building efforts in YO communities, the strengths and challenges of the program, lessons learned, and recommendations for policy and approach. The following are appended: (1) YO Community Collaborations with Other Systems; (2) Communities Indicating Success Worth Sharing in Various Areas; and (3) Contact Information for Respondents to the &quot;Youth Opportunity: Lessons Learned Survey.&quot;",

        "description":"In February 2005, Achieve and the National Governors Association sponsored a National Education Summit on High Schools at which governors from 45 states, business leaders and education officials addressed the preparation gap that leaves many high school graduates unprepared for success in college and the workplace. The Summit helped focus the nation's attention on how our schools, our students and our economy intersect, and it coalesced support for an action agenda to revitalize America's high schools. The agenda included raising academic standards and graduation requirements, building stronger data and measurement systems, better preparing teachers, redesigning high schools, and holding both the K?12 and postsecondary systems accountable for improved performance. In an effort to monitor state progress toward the Summit goals, Achieve surveyed all 50 states in December 2005 on a key subset of the policies from the Summit action agenda -- those focused on aligning high school academic standards, course requirements, assessments, and data and accountability systems with postsecondary and workplace expectations. In most states there is a large gap between what high schools expect and what colleges and employers demand, an expectations gap. This report examines progress states are making in closing the gap.

        "description":"Say Yes to Education is a scholarship guarantee program that pledges to young children and their families a fully paid, post-secondary education along with academic and social supports that follow children throughout their elementary and high school careers. Since its inception in 1987, the Say Yes to Education program has &quot;adopted&quot; cohorts of students in Philadelphia, Hartford, and Cambridge. In fall 2002, Say Yes to Education (Say Yes) invited Research for Action (RFA) to conduct an evaluation of its Philadelphia chapter's work. The Philadelphia chapter's current cohort was unique in two respects: (1) the children were selected from Head Start programs, thus becoming the youngest Say Yes students ever, and (2) significant supports (scholarships for parents and siblings) were promised to families of Say Yes students. This holistic approach emerged from a growing recognition that each Say Yes student is part of a unique family system in which educational opportunities for all can contribute to making education a family priority. This report suggests that Say Yes derives its power to improve children?s lives through three interrelated traits: (1) a relational model of working with children and families to build caring and trusting connections; (2) a holistic approach to the family that increases academic proficiency; and (3) an ecological vision of the child as embedded in the spheres of home and school. The track record of Say Yes staff in building and maintaining strong relationships with parents and children is impressive and could serve as a model for many urban teachers and school personnel. Appended are: (1) Methodology; (2) Model of Theory in Use; and (3) Quantitative Findings of Test Performance, Attendance, and Behavior.",

The purpose of this research was to give EW/NSCC deeper insights into the accomplishments and challenges of the program and to suggest ideas for program improvement. This research consisted of both in-depth qualitative data collection and surveys of corpsmembers and school staff. For the qualitative research, RFA observed multiple socialized recess periods at four school sites and interviewed thirty-five representatives of both EducationWorks and school staff. For the survey component, RFA conducted the NSCC Recess Survey about recess programming among both corpsmembers (N=27) and school staff (N=35), with the help of NSCC team leaders. The overall response rate was lower than expected, with  surveys returned from seven out of 17 schools. Despite the relatively low number of schools and individuals that completed and returned surveys, the survey findings provide useful triangulation for the qualitative data; thus, the authors have included survey data in the report as appropriate. Finally, this report draws on data from a separate survey of seventy-five corps-members conducted by RFA for EW/NSCC; it provides data about corpsmember training needs relevant to SR work. This research indicates that the vast majority of school staff interviewed and surveyed thought that NSCC's socialized recess program provided significant benefit to their school.

The universe of students is confined to those who attended a four-year college at any time, thus including students who started out in other types of institutions, particularly community colleges. The core question is not about basic &quot;access&quot; to higher education. It is not about persistence to the second term or the second year following  postsecondary entry. It is about completion of academic credentials--the culmination of opportunity, guidance, choice, effort, and commitment.

To achieve this goal it is important that students investigate ways of living in cultures different from their own. It is also important that they investigate the contributions of different cultures. The investigation of important places and structures that often represent a cultural group's contributions to human history will help to achieve this goal of better cultural understanding. This paper includes skills from the language arts and social studies curriculums within a multicultural inquiry into landmarks from around the world. The intent is to help students towards an understanding of the unique histories and accomplishments of many of the societies that are now part of America's cultural landscape. This paper is an example of an elementary classroom project that uses multicultural perspectives of world landmarks to encourage students to think deeply about landmarks and their meanings to a variety of cultures. The study is an example of the incorporation of children's non-fiction books, print resources and teacher evaluated websites in the structure of a group project. In the project students create inquiries in groups that explore essential questions common to each landmark and conduct research based on these questions.",

Also this study furthers the discussion of teachers as public servants essential to the maintenance of the democratic state by demonstrating how teachers' actions on this day show the essential qualities of public service. Additionally the study focuses on the personal and emotional responses of teachers to the attacks and the effect these responses had on their actions in the classroom.  The intent is to further the research on the emotions of teachers and their connection to classroom decision making, as well as to inform research on classroom decision making in more ordinary circumstances by looking at teacher decision making in extraordinary circumstances. This study is the first part of a future study that will compare the responses and decisions of teachers to the responses and decisions of individuals outside of the classroom, who were located not only in Queens but in Manhattan, including lower Manhattan and the World Trade Center itself.

This study found concerns regarding OHLAP funding, lowered student eligibility standards, and poor program publicity. Despite concerns for the program, however, the program is gaining new government attention regarding funding and accessibility. Also, slight increases in publicity are helping to inform students and parents about tuition assistance via OHLAP. Recommendations from this study include investigating students' perspectives about OHLAP and researching OHLAP eligibility as it compares to current Oklahoma students' academic success.",

        "description":"The validity of inferences based on achievement test scores is dependent on the amount of effort that examinees put forth while taking the test. With low-stakes tests, for which this problem is particularly prevalent, there is a consequent need for psychometric models that can take into account different levels of examinee effort. This article introduces the effort-moderated IRT model, which incorporates item response time into proficiency estimation and item parameter estimation. In two studies of the effort-moderated model when rapid guessing (i.e., reflecting low examinee effort) was present, one based on real data and the other on simulated data, the effort-moderated model performed better than the standard 3PL model. Specifically, it was found that the effort-moderated model (a) showed better model fit, (b) yielded more accurate item parameter estimates, (c) more accurately estimated test information, and (d) yielded proficiency estimates with higher convergent validity.

To compare the sets of threshold parameters, we used the method designed by Wise and Kong (2005) to assess the reliability and validity of response time effort scores, which were generated on the basis of the specified threshold values. The results showed only minor differences among the four threshold identification methods. Recommendations were given regarding the uses of the methods. (Contains  tables and 2 figures.)",

This study introduces a new method for measuring examinee test-taking effort on computer-based test items based on item response time.  This measure, termed response time effort (RTE), is based on the hypothesis that when administered an item, unmotivated examinees will answer too quickly (i.e., before they had time to read and fully consider the item).  Psychometric characteristics of RTE scores were empirically investigated and supportive evidence for score reliability and validity was found.  Potential applications of RTE scores and their implications are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 4 figures.)",

A problem inherent in such testing is that we often cannot assume that all examinees give their best effort to their test, which suggests that the test scores of some examinees will underestimate their actual levels of proficiency. This study investigated several testing methods that may promote examinee effort. One of the advantages of computer-based tests (CBTs) over traditional paper-and-pencil tests is their potential for administering items and tests in innovative ways. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of four types of CBTs on the effort and test performance of examinees administered a low-stakes test: a fixed-item test, a computerized adaptive test, a self-adapted test, and a special self-adapted test that was designed to be more \"game-like.\"  Seven hundred eleven undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to take a low-stakes mathematics test under one of the four CBT types. No differences were found among the test types for test performance, self-reported effort, or response time effort. Although disappointing, the results from this study enhance the understanding of the dynamics underlying examinee effort. (Contains 8 tables.)",

        "description":"No population exists where it is more important to produce information literate individuals than teacher candidates, yet few would suggest that practitioners newly entering the field are adequately prepared to model and teach information literacy to their students. Consequently, information literacy has recently been established as a key outcome by a number of teacher education accrediting bodies and professional associations. Only in the last few years has there been an attempt to develop a standardized scale to assess general information literacy skills, and at the time of this writing no standardized tool exists that measures the information literacy levels of  teacher candidates. This study documents the development and validation of a standardized instrument to measure teacher candidates' information literacy skills levels based on the International Society for Technology in Education's 2000 National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers and the Association of College and Research Libraries' 2000 Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education. Undergraduate students enrolled in the teacher education program at the University of Central Florida were identified and asked to complete a test consisting of 22 multiple-choice test items and 13 demographic and self-percept items. A number of procedures designed to enhance validity and reliability of the scale were integrated throughout its development. Results of the test were also submitted to analysis. This project is part of a national initiative to develop standardized information literacy assessment tools specific to a discipline, and is spear-headed by the Project for the Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills and the Institute for Library and Information Literacy Education. Use of the instrument described herein will allow librarians and teaching faculty a means to inform curricular and instructional decisions, and results can be used for internal and external benchmarking of education students' information literacy skills levels.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between barriers to technology integration and the behavioral, affective, and temporal constructs in a technology-rich environment. A group of 69 (24%) faculty completed a web-based questionnaire which identified barriers and grouped faculty into a number of categories. The study used three established tools to measure these associations. Barriers were evaluated using a modified version of a perception of barriers instrument designed by Hadley and Sheingold (1993). The two other major measures have been developed out of Concerns Based Adoption Model (Hall, Wallace, & Dossett, 1973). The behavioral aspect used the Technology Implementation Standards Configuration Matrix designed by Mills (2002), while the affective aspect used the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (Hall, George, & Rutherford, 1986). The temporal aspect was measured through a simple question probing the length of time one has taught within a technology-rich environment. Key results indicate that the main barriers were related to being unsure as to how to integrate technology and lack of support- both technical and pedagogical. Lack of time was also identified as a significant barrier by a number of the groups attempting to integrate technology. The results of this investigation indicate that barriers are indeed perceived differently in a technology-rich environment, and that a number of relationships do exist between the aforementioned constructs. To effectively integrate technology in a technology-rich environment, educators need to create technology integration plans which address professional development, program standards, and curricular integration while considering the differing needs of their target population.

The Saudi educational system is mostly based on Islamic precepts. Nonetheless, the United States government and other critics continue to blame the Saudi educational system on many levels, saying that education in Saudi Arabia mostly encourages the students to engage in violent actions labeled as Jihad. Consequently, these critics have called upon the Saudi government to change its educational system. However, changing the educational system in Saudi Arabia is not an easy task for Saudis as Americans think, because education is associated with IslamCa way of life for the country=s citizens. The American insistence also hinges on the notion that Islamic education and Western education are incompatible. In this paper, I argue that the Arabic term tirbyi, which is translated into English as education, is compatible with Western educational precepts, despite their cultural differences. I also argue that the Islamic educational paradigm transcends pedagogy (the art and science of teaching), andragogy (the art and science of helping adults learn), ergonagy (the art and science of helping people learn to work), and heutagogy (the study of self-determined learning).",

        "description":"With the rise of globalization, education has become increasingly important throughout the world. It is through education that most children develop vital social and mental skills that help them later in life to become successful in the working world. The way a country runs its affairs and how it relates to other countries are based largely on how its youth are educated. Most people realize the need for education; but as long as they see a school building with teachers, they think something productive is happening behind the building walls. This is not always the case. Education varies throughout the world, and the differences in educational standards do more to explain cultural differences than anything else. Thus, the differing standards of education in the United States and South Africa call for a need to standardize the education curricula internationally. This paper shows, through qualitative analysis, what specific differences in standards of education cause people in various countries to act as they do in functioning in the global system. Through archival research of data sources on the educational systems in South Africa and the United States, and examining how these countries act toward others, a relationship between education standards and intercultural communication is shown. This helps to explain how the different standards of education affect international communication.",

Indeed, a number of psychologists have demonstrated that SR serve to regulate behaviours in relation to social norms, and that a change in a person's SR influences her or his judgments and actions. This study consists of descriptions of children's SR of violence, and verifying whether these SR are stable or dynamic at ages of five and six years, and whether children are or are not stimulated by the Philosophy for Children approach used throughout one school year. Firstly, the results indicate that children's SR of violence can be grouped into four hierarchical perspectives. Secondly, the results indicate that the SR of children in the control groups hardly changed during the year, whereas those of children in the experimental groups showed a reorganization that was more marked.

        "description":"Many research-related classes in social sciences present probability as a unified approach based upon mathematical axioms, but neglect the diversity of various probability theories and their associated philosophical assumptions. Although currently the dominant statistical and probabilistic approach is the Fisherian tradition, the use of Fisherian significance testing of the null hypothesis and its probabilistic inference has been an ongoing debate. This paper attempts to explore the richness and complexity of the ideas of probability with the emphasis on the relationships between Fisherian and other probability theories. First, it clarifies the differences between Fisher and Jeffreys and explains the background history relating to Fisher's quest for certainty. Second, it explains the differences between Fisher and Pearson and explains the limitations of the Fisherian approach. In addition, it argues that although Fisher criticized the Bayesian school for its alleged lack of objectivity, Fisher's quest for certainty is driven by his subjective faith in experimental methods, eugenics and Darwinism. Last, it will briefly introduce the synthesized approaches by Berger and Pawitan, respectively, as a possible remedy. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Many students share a popular misconception that statistics is a subject-free methodology derived from invariant and timeless mathematical axioms. It is proposed that statistical education should include the aspect of history/philosophy of science. This article will discuss how statistical methods developed by Karl Pearson and R. A. Fisher are driven by biological themes and philosophical presumptions. Pearson was pre-occupied with between-group speciation and thus his statistical methods, such as the Chi-squared test, are categorical in nature. On the other hand, variation within species plays a central role in Fisher's framework, and therefore, Fisher's approach, such as partitioning variance, is concerned with interval-scaled data. In addition, Fisher adopted a philosophy of embracing causal inferences and theoretical entities, such as infinite population and gene, while Pearson disregarded unobservable and insisted upon description of the data at hand. These differences lead to the subsequent divergence of two hypothesis testing methods, developed by R. A. Fisher and Neyman/E .S. Pearson, son of Karl Pearson, respectively. Students will appreciate the meanings of Fisherian and Pearsonian methods if they are exposed to history and philosophy of science. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"This article is a critique of the Dworkinian theory of fairness in the context of Affirmative Action. Although Dworkin committed tremendous endeavors in an attempt to give a fairness argument backed by an empirical study, the question of whether affirmative action is fair remains inconclusive. The sample used in the study is unrepresentative, and the results are open to interpretation. If legitimacy and fairness of a policy is a matter of the fit between the theory and the practical consequence, would the change of racial composition within the country, such as the increasing number of immigrants, and the change of a country's role in the international community, such as globalization, affect the current meaning of diversity? Moreover, although diversity seems to be a reasonable goal, Dworkin failed to make a strong case for why specially admitting Blacks into elite universities is essential for justice. Also, the question of fairness remains unanswered because the lesson of Singapore and Malaysia shows that the general interest of society is not warranted by a policy of sacrificing a few people.",

Teachers often believe that they need remediation or assistance in applying assessment concepts and techniques, as well as making assessment-related decisions. In an effort to measure teachers' &quot;assessment literacy,&quot; an instrument, titled the &quot;Assessment Literacy Inventory (ALI),&quot; was developed and its psychometric properties evaluated. The &quot;ALI&quot; was designed to parallel existing &quot;Standards for Teacher Competence in the Educational Assessment of Students.&quot; A two-stage pilot test of the instrument was conducted with 152 preservice teachers in Fall 2003 and 249 preservice teachers in the Spring 2004. Item analyses of the second-stage pilot data revealed an overall instrument reliability (KR20) of 0.74. Individual item analyses (i.e., item difficulties and item discriminations), as well as other indices, were examined. Recommendations for future research include content and construct validation of the &quot;ALI&quot; (both of which are currently being examined), as well as an investigation of the appropriateness of the &quot;ALI&quot; as a measure of inservice teacher assessment literacy. Finally, the &quot;Assessment Literacy Inventory&quot; provides a practical mechanism for educators to measure assessment literacy. Considering the current state of high-stakes accountability in education, the &quot;ALI&quot; could provide school districts an effective, as well as efficient way to allocate resources for developing or otherwise selecting teacher professional development opportunities on the topic of classroom assessment.

This problem has been dealt with through answering the following two questions: 1-  What are the strategies followed by the EFL student teachers in the translation process?; 2 -  What are the educational implications for enhancing the teaching of translation at faculties of education? Since it is a think aloud protocol-based case study, the final sample of the present research consisted of 12 students in three different years (first, third and fourth) in the English language section at Benha Faculty of Education. A translation test was developed and face-validated by a jury of three experts in the field. It consisted of ten Arabic sentences to be translated from Arabic into English and two English paragraphs to be translated into Arabic. The test was administered, in the university year 2002-2003, to 12 students. The test subjects produced the translations on their own and alone, one by one separately, as they preferred. Before they started the translations, one-hour meeting was held for each year to raise the students' awareness as well as to train them to think aloud while they translate. They were also asked to verbalize everything that came into their minds while performing the translation task. They were told that the objective of the investigation was to find out aspects of mental translation procedures. After these instructions, they were given the test sheet and a cassette recorder. Two dictionaries, a monolingual and a bilingual, were intentionally brought to the test room, for those who need to use them. During the test, they proceeded in the way s/he normally liked. There was no limited time for completing the test. After the translations had been recorded, they were transcribed for subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis which revealed the strategies followed by the sample to solve the problems they faced when they translated into the two languages. Finally, Some educational implications and recommendations for translation instruction were suggested. (Contains 8 tables.)",

The survey results strongly indicated that teachers in all three groups value the same top five principal behaviors and attitudes reported in the original study: 1. Respects and values teachers as professionals; 2. As an open door policy--is accessible, available, willing to listen; 3. Is fair, honest, trustworthy; 4. Supports teachers with parents; 5. Is supportive of teachers in matters of student discipline. The findings also indicated some differences in perception on what teachers value most at different stages of their careers. Concerned principals who are willing to adopt the positive, valued behaviors suggested in this study may encourage teachers at all career stages, increase the stability of their schools, and impact the quality of instruction their students receive.

A review of the literature shows that this skill is affected by a number of factors, including exposure to cultural diversity. The University of Guam (UOG) located in the western Pacific is multicultural and multilingual. Using data from focus groups, this study examined the perceived influence of diversity experiences on critical thinking among UOG students in the College of Professional Studies (Business, Education, and Nursing). The study participants defined critical thinking as the act of independently and systematically weighing evidence to make an evaluation and judgment, to determine merit, and to increase a desirable outcome. Diversity experiences helped the participants to develop sensitivity and awareness of self. The findings of this study confirm the results of prior studies on diversity and critical thinking. Educational importance of the findings was discussed. (Contains 1 table.)",

Data was generated from a survey consisted of a scaled response mechanism (Likert scale) composed of a six-point rating scale in which the attitude of the respondent was measured on a continuum from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The survey was divided into three sections. The first asked respondents to evaluate the TEP at UTC in terms of the knowledge and skills they perceived the program helped them develop. The second section asked participants to evaluate educational opportunities offered via the UTC Teacher Education Program prior to the student teaching experience, and the third section allowed the respondents to identify three strengths of the TEP and three changes they would make to the program if given the opportunity. Data analysis of the Likert scale section of the survey indicated no significant differences in attitudes between the two groups, however larger percentage differences to questions taken from section two of the survey were examined as well as responses to section three. Responses to this section of the survey indicated that PDS participants perceived themselves to be better prepared than their non-PDS counterparts.",

Distance education programmes, especially those of the Universities of Ibadan and Lagos are examined. These two institutions made bold and commendable efforts. However, while print media seemed successfully made use of, unfortunately electronic media were beyond the capabilities of the two institutions. Based on the study's findings, suggestions for effective distance education in Nigeria include: (1) a separate tertiary institution, such as the Nigerian Open University (NOU), which was formerly aborted but recently reopened, should be well equipped and maintained; (2) NOU should be assigned special radio stations and television channels (or separate radio stations and television channels should be established for NOU's use); (3) distance education should provide for the interest of all who need different programmes, including liberal education; (4) public libraries should be established in all the big towns; and (5) well-stocked libraries should be established at the zonal centres (which ideally, should be at tertiary institutions).",

An initial literature review suggested that while a number of studies had been completed in the past two decades that report student characteristics, motivations, and prior experiences of study, most of these studies had been carried out from the point of view and perspective of the providing institutions, not from the perspective of students. This paper looks at distance learning as described by the learners- it is their story, their experience, and their perspective. In particular, this paper looks at learning support in distance learning at UUM, an issue that arose from discussions with the students, rather than being preordained by the research design or derived directly from my own initial interest as a distance educator and as a researcher. From these findings conclusions have been drawn regarding the role of learning support and guidelines to improve future learning support services to facilitate and provide a better Open &amp; Distance Learning (ODL) educational experience and outcome in Malaysia.

Independent samples T-tests indicated a mean difference between regular education students and students with LD educational classification in self-reported levels of being bullied, (p is less than .001). In particular, the children in special education endorsed significantly more incidences of being bullied than their regular education counterparts. Moreover, the data suggested that lack of protective influences, such as liking school and number of friends, was negatively correlated with increased self-reported victimization and bullying behavior. Limitations to this study include, but are not limited to, small sample size, especially students with a special education label.

It was not long before the blogosphere took notice. Taking the theme and running with it, Alice and Bill ask, &quot;Computers Make School Kids Dumber?&quot; They theorize, &quot;If you track the admitted decline of education, you'll probably notice that it follows along with the increase of technology in the classroom.&quot; In a similar vein, James Bartholomew asks, &quot;Do you think that the government will turn down the volume of its boasting about how it has spent billions introducing computers in schools (while keeping down the pay of teachers so much that there are shortages)? Do you think it will stop sending governors of state schools glossy pamphlets about insisting that computers are used in their schools as much as possible?&quot; In this study, therefore, PISA looks well beyond educational attainment, and also includes school demographics, such as whether it is a public or private school, has large or small classes, or has access or not to technological resources. Finally, it does measure student information-their family background, access to books and computers and parental support as well. The PISA survey departs from previous surveys in disregarding the stated curricula of the schools being measured. Therefore, the conclusion is not surprising, nor even wrong for him to consider independently of any parental or teacher support, considered without reference to the software running on it, considered without reference to student attitudes and interests, does not positively impact an education.

Higher education institutions, as one of these nonprofit organizations, provide us with excellent examples of this trend (Hayes, 1991). The marketing of higher education has received a tremendous amount of emphasis and attention. Distance education (DE) has become an accepted form of education and has been gaining widespread popularity in recent years. Marketing concept has been gaining importance in distance education sector throughout the world. The factors responsible for this are self-support policies, increasing competitiveness in the marketplace, rising customer expectations, widening access to education etc (Gupta, 2005). More than 70 countries are offering educational programmes through distance education all over the world today (Sudalaimuthu, Visited 3rd March, 2005, http://www.ignou.ac.in/Theme-1/S.%20Sudalaimuthu.htm). Because of flexibility, convenience and opportunity, distance education is becoming so popular, profitable and vital. By 2005, 90% of American universities will offer at least one course online. Currently about 3 million Americans are distance education students (Gonzales, 2002). In this paper, I will discuss the following questions: What is the brief history and changing environment of distance education? Which marketing communication tools are used in DE institutions? What benefits does marketing communications provide to DE institutions? (Contains 2 tables.)",

Accomplishing this goal required administration of the Multicultural/Diversity Scale?Revised (MCR) at pre/post points. Data were collected from 90 pre-service and 90 in-service teachers. Inquirers used a quantitative descriptive statistical design to analyze these data. Reliability was computed on the instrument which indicated a .90 index. The data collected in this study indicated a significant difference among pre-service students in the category of Acceptance for pre-test data; however, no significant difference emerged in this category for posttest data. Inquirers surmised the difference was not present in posttest data due to the instruction administered during the course between pre-test and posttest data collection.",

        "description":"Reading in the Malaysian primary and secondary school system is largely a master of skill mastery and school textbooks, workbooks and even examinations are a testament to this approach. The teacher of reading is often forced to make the choice of training her learners to read and answer comprehension questions for examination purposes. Reading in the university, in contrast is much more cognitively demanding, especially for content study. The university student has to read actively and engage with the text, glean important information critically and synthesize information from a variety of related texts for academic writing assignments and discussions. There appears to be a mismatch between what the learners can do as a result of limited training in school and what they are expected to do for academic reading in the university. This study sets out to investigate how the learners read and what learning strategies they were using to complete a summary task. Think alouds were employed to gain insights into the learners' processing of the text and this was done individually with each learner. Interviews were then conducted with each learner and each learner's oral summary was also examined to help understand strategy use. The findings of the study revealed certain patterns in the learners' processing of a text and these are discussed as the four syndromes. As educators there is an urgent need for us to reconsider the way reading is taught and an understanding of what learners do to help them make sense of a text is a good place to begin.",

Self-reports were collected from 197 American college students (White = 87, Hispanic = 56, Black = 54) in three different types of higher education institutions in the Southwest region of the U.S. A series of MANOVA or MANCOVA models indicated that degree of identification with one's ethnic group (covariate), rather than the independent variable of ethnic group, was crucial in predicting one's independent and interdependent self-construal scores. No ethnic differences existed for any of the preferences of classroom organization. Additionally, a multiple regression mediation analysis indicated self-construals appeared not to act as mediators of students' preferences for learning organizations, as opposing to the self-construal theory. Further research is needed to test the validity of self-construal theory or the self-construal scale. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Simulations and games have been used in education for decades, but most of this development has been in the areas of business and economics. Well-designed simulations and games have been shown to improve decision-making and critical thinking skills as well as teaching discipline-specific concepts. Active learning also helps students develop interpersonal and communications skills. It is believed that simulations can be adapted and developed in other areas of education. In this paper, a description of a simulation that has been developed and used in a human development course in the teacher education program is reviewed.  Students were divided into groups and the groups were given specific roles related to a scenario dealing with a dysfunctional family. The roles included the parents, advocates for the children, the children?s teachers, psychologists, and judges. The groups were given information at the beginning and during the simulation. The advocate groups made their presentations to the judges and the judges decided the case. The simulation was constructed so that there was no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer. The most important part of the scenario was the debriefing that occurred after the judges reached a decision. At this time, the participants discussed the reasons related to the responses and the problem solving process used within the simulation. By dissecting the motives and actions of the individual participants, it was possible to identify the underlying themes. In the simulation described here, the students were able to identify cooperation and cooperative learning, problem solving, communication, self-efficacy, motivation, and application as important themes. The simulation provided students with a hands-on exercise that illustrated and reinforced those concepts and skills that will be important in their careers.",

More specifically, what characteristics or themes do graduates of a teacher education program self-report as being effective components of their training? The research question was, \"What characteristics do teacher education graduates report as being important components of their training?\" The sub-questions of the study were, What is the effect of teacher education training on student satisfaction and success? What beliefs do graduates report regarding their training in the teacher education program? There were a total of 22 participants in the study. 17 were female and five were male. Of the total participants, 19 are currently in the teaching and education field. Six have full-time, contract teaching positions; seven participants have full-time substitute positions; three are part-time substitutes; three are graduate students in teacher education; and three participants are not in the teaching field. The survey contained nine demographic questions, nine quantitative questions, and 12 qualitative questions. The purpose of the survey instrument was to assess a student's belief, satisfaction, and dissatisfaction regarding the teacher education program.  A novel survey was created and used as an interview guide for the trained phone interviewer. The interviewer contacted each of the participants and went step-by-step throughout the interview guide asking the participant each of the survey questions. The respondents rated the quantitative questions with great satisfaction. Taking into account a 1 to 10 scale, with ten being \"Strongly Agree,\" the participants ranked their satisfaction with the teacher education program with at least an 8.25 response. The highest response was 9.4 and this was related to the fact that the students felt their course work contained up-to-date information in their field of study. Taking into account the qualitative data, there were 12 themes described in this study. The themes were (1) Independent Thinker, (2) Value of Teaching and Children, (3) Educational Technology, (4) Diversity, (5) Human Development, (6) Educational Psychology, (7) Teaching Satisfaction, (8) Useful Aspects of Teacher Education Program, (9) Least Useful Aspects of Teacher Education Program, (10) Overall Preparedness (11) Clinical Experience Preparation, and (12) General Education Courses.

The design of this study relied on an interview process that empowered both researchers to create their own narratives as they constructed their concerns and motivations about online pedagogy. The narratives were analyzed for generative themes. Two themes related to changes in the faculty as a result of completing the online module development processes seemed to emerge: empowerment and competence. Both themes were related to two current educational psychology theories. One theory emphasizes developing a self-regulated learner able to be in control of his own learning. The other stresses the importance of the teacher as a mediator of instruction. The authors identify and discuss three important factors that influence faculty development of online pedagogical competence: a) having a shared goal for developing online instructional modules, b) emphasizing each partner's unique areas of expertise, and c) providing encouragement and support to go beyond current comfort levels.

The goal was to prepare or redesign courses for web-based delivery of courses combined with select face-to-face campus-based components leading to a Master of Education in Special Education degree with Cross Categorical Certification. Although the faculty of the Department of Special Education in the College of Education were committed to having an online presence, the majority of the faculty expressed a need for further training in online instruction and course authoring tools. For example, only two of the special education faculty maintained a web page and one had participated in the development of the first virtual university classes in 1997. A total of 22 faculty and faculty associates participated in Spring 2002 activities: six COE faculty; and seven faculty associates. In addition, six people from the originally convened group (February 4) withdrew either due to illness or too full an academic schedule. Three academic advisor's completed the online workshop and created modules for advising prospective candidates for the program or prospective student teachers. Pre and post survey responses to Gene Hall's Stages of Concern Questionnaire are reported. In addition, a theme analysis is reported on participants' spontaneous reactions matching the stages of concern ratings. Implications for higher education faculty development are emphasized.

It is a non-profit, non-stock organization registered in the United States with the Internal Revenue Service and the office of the Secretary Of State, Commonwealth of Kentucky respectively. The Project was originally registered in Sierra Leone in 1998 as a non-governmental organization (NGO) under the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of Children and Gender Affairs respectively. Our work centered on foster-care, teenage-mother and child welfare and education, advocacy, and outreach. We also collaborated with government agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide one-time or short-term emergency aid to destitute children and families. The project was born in the hope that it would help the country to develop a national child-care program that will rehabilitate children through community foster-care and in which the needs of the whole child (emotional, social, intellectual, physical and creative) will be addressed.

        "description":"(Purpose) The purpose of the study was to assess changes in college students' attitudes towards lesbians and gay men over a five-year span. A secondary purpose of the study was to build a foundation for assessing the relationship between spirituality and observed attitudes. Previous studies have only used religiosity, which is one of the most significant predictors of negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. It is asserted here that spirituality is a different construct, and because of this, it was hypothesized that it would not be related to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. (Methodology) The Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) scale was administered to 544 college students at a midsize Midwestern University in late 1996, and followed up again in early 2002. The Spirituality Assessment Scale (SAS) was also administered in 2002. (Results) As expected, attitudes in 2002 were significantly more positive than in 1996, and as expected, level of spirituality was not significantly related to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. (Conclusions) Results contribute to literature that indicates young adults are becoming increasingly more positive in their attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Students at higher education institutions are perhaps now more willing to address issues related toward homosexuality because of a societal shift in attitudes. The importance of educators taking active stances to create successful academic learning environments is discussed. Furthermore, spirituality was not related to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. (Recommendations) Because spirituality was not related to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men, results give credence to the theory that spirituality and religion are different constructs. Researchers must carefully and deliberately operationalize these constructs when considering them for inclusion in future research.",

Past research has shown that students' desire personalized relationships with academic personnel; however, little research exists on exactly how advisors and student affairs counselors can go about building a personal relationship with students within the confines of an academic relationship. Methodology: Data obtained from participant-observation case study research is used to highlight the components and structure involved in one advisor's relationships with 11 students. Themes were extracted from observations and interviews. Results: Nine components of &quot;personalization&quot; in student affairs advising are presented which encourage academic advisors and other relevant personnel to make personal connections with students beyond simple technical competencies. These components include prepping, attending, bonding, disclosing, laughing, counseling, normalizing, coaching, and continuing. A secondary aspect of this study included a focus on student attitudes regarding personalization. The student data contained herein provide, it is asserted, evidence that a personalized relationship does impact students in a positive manner. Conclusions: Results provide a framework for academic advisors and educational personnel to use to enhance relationships with students that may ultimately help promote successful academic and educational outcomes. Recommendations: Academic advisors and other student affairs professionals need to connect with students on a personal level in order for optimal outcomes. Educational personnel who work with students need to realize the power contained in forming &quot;personalized&quot; relationships and strive to attain such to benefit their student clients.",

All of the reviews have been checked for accuracy in two ways. First, each author received feedback from the professor. After each feedback session, authors then revised their papers.  The topics of the research reviews represent a range of interests emerging from the individual author's background, experience, and curiosity. The importance of the topics is reflected in their reasons for uncovering the impact of various specialized interventions in terms of effects on special populations (e.g., students with Oppositional Defiance Disorder, children with emotional and behavior disorders, individuals with autism and autism spectrum disorder, children who watch too much television, and so on.) The types of interventions that were critiqued include parent training programs, reinforcement, positive peer reporting, social story. The types of single subject research designs included reversal, multiple baseline, alternating treatment, and changing criterion designs.

All the blocks (consisted of mathematics content, mathematics methodology and pedagogy courses) taken by pre-service teachers in spring 2002 at a four-year southwest university participated in the study. The findings reported here are from one of the blocks where the integrated approach was fully implemented. The preliminary results indicate that students had noticeable positive changes on their attitude towards and perception of mathematics. Many of them became more optimistic about their ability to do mathematics. Educators of prospective teachers can consider approaches similar to the one reported here in order to address low motivation and negative attitude toward mathematics. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Online activities and content promote active, collaborative, and accessible learning. Faculty recognize these benefits, but often struggle with finding the time and effort to develop Web material. This article presents a development system for faculty creating online materials to enhance their face-to-face courses. The process of determining the purpose, organizing the content, and evaluating the results leads instructors through an effective development plan. Faculty use course management systems for a variety of administrative and pedagogical reasons, such as to augment course content, increase active learning, provide feedback, and increase communication.

The purpose of this study was to examine the credibility of evidence-based claims underlying the literature related to Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) (Shulman, 1986). Using a hybrid cross-validation method, and criteria from the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2001), the National Research Council (NRC, 2002), and the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA, 2002), the study analyzed and evaluated 51 published journal articles containing PCK in the title. Findings indicate that PCK can be labeled a &quot;successful program of research&quot; and represent the intent of the &quot;scientifically-based research standards&quot;; however, no single published article meets all the criteria for &quot;scientifically-based research.&quot; Thus, PCK as a construct defined by this sample of literature is not based upon scientifically-based research. This finding calls into question the application of PCK within the NCATE accreditation evaluation criteria and the applications of PCK within teacher education. Questions raised and implications for teacher education are addressed. Further, recommendations for re-examining both the ideology underlying PCK, as well as SBR, is presented.

Records of over 8000 high school students from five large Midwest high schools were analyzed to determine the relationship between the first achievement grade students were assigned during an academic term and their final course grades. Results showed that grades were remarkably stable, with correlations between first achievement grades and final course grades generally ranging between +.4 and +.7. Correlations were typically larger for 9th and 10th grade courses than 11th and 12th grade courses. Differences among departments (subject areas) were statistically significant, but differences among schools were not. Differences related to student gender, grade level, ethnicity, and poverty level also were statistically significant but modest in magnitude.

This paper presents the problem as one of reducing variation in students' achievement, and reviews the work of renowned educator Benjamin Bloom on this problem. Bloom argued that to reduce variation in students' achievement and to have all students learn well, we must increase variation in instructional approaches and learning time. The key element in this effort is well constructed, formative classroom assessments. Bloom outlined a specific strategy for using formative classroom assessments to guide teachers in differentiating their instruction and labeled it \"mastery learning.\" This paper describes Bloom's work, presents the essential elements of mastery learning, explains common misinterpretations, and describes the results of research on its effects.

Now, in these twenty-nine interviews, I continue that process, focusing more intently, however, on the impact of consumer behavior on the adult learner. Why? Adults as learners are frequently searching for meaning in their lives: the complexity of economics and the consumption of goods and services tend to be woven into their search. Since the context of all of life's situations is fluid across time and space, actors cannot be assured that their states of being will remain constant and secure. They hope for meaningful opportunities that will enrich, reward, and uplift their states of being. They may scheme, strategize for what they intend, and be pleased at the intended or unintended outcomes. They may also scheme, strategize for what they intend, only to be surprised, angered, or saddened by unintended outcomes. &quot;Price tags,&quot; however, are frequently attached to their hopes. It is in the context of these fluid, and sometimes turbulent situations that opportunities for lifelong learning emerge.

        "description":"How might human intelligence evolve over the next 100 years? This issue paper explores that idea. First, the paper summarizes five emerging perspectives about human intelligence: Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, Robert Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence, Ellen Langer's mindfulness theory, David Perkins' learnable intelligences theory, and Patricia Wolfe's brain research for the classroom. These persuasions seem to be merging into a family of views that counter the long held belief that intelligence is a single, unchanging IQ score. The theories illustrate convergence, a 21st century phenomenon across a number of fields including digital electronics. As such, the five views might be termed \"teachable intelligence\" because they share the belief that intelligences can grow over a life span. Then, best, worst, and probable scenarios tell how human intelligence might evolve in our nation.

Two alternatives, which are being offered by employers, are flextime and telecommuting. &quot;While flextime was slow to take off in the United States, it is now the most common type of flexible work arrangement&quot; (Avery &amp; Zabel, 2001). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in May 2001, about 29 million full-time wage and salary workers had flexible work schedules, which allowed them to vary the time they began or ended work. According to a survey conducted for Olsen Corporation, based in Melville, N.Y., the majority of North American companies, 51 percent, now allow their employees to telecommute to work through ongoing pilot programs. Approximately 15 percent of today's workforce telecommutes at least once a week. Both alternative work arrangements have benefits.  For the employer, flextime and telecommuting are used as a tool to broaden their employee base. For the employee, the programs offer more work to personal life balance. The downside, for employers, is that middle management resists the concept of employees working in an unsupervised environment. Furthermore, some employees don't take advantage of the programs in fear that their managers will look negatively upon them.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the psycho-social factors (attitudes, identity, and perceptions) affecting pre-service teacher education majors in a cross-cultural pedagogical environment (African American professors and white students). The two main objectives that was explored in this study consisted of; (1) student learning and factors affecting students' relationships with African American faculty in cross-cultural pedagogical environments, and (b) racial and cultural attitudes and identity factors that affect the preparation of pre-service Teacher Education majors in cross-cultural pedagogical relationships. This study analyzed the between - group dynamics and the within group psycho-social factors. Group dynamics are referred to as the relationship between the African American professors and their non-minority students. For this study the with-in group psycho-social factors being those identifiable dispositions such as attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs based on prior social experiences. The construction of a sixteen question research-based instrument was used to collect and analyze pre-service teacher data to provide information on the role ethnicity plays in influencing student's viewpoints. The population in this study consisted of 35 male and 119 female senior level pre-service teachers representing rural Southwestern Missouri. The results of this study suggest a positive image of the current attitudes and perceptions of teacher education majors toward race and ethnicity. Student's responses in this study suggested that in a cross-cultural classroom environment, the race and/or ethnicity of faculty do not negatively influence student's attitudes and perceptions. Results further indicated that the professor's culture and ethnicity may possibly contribute to the overall effectiveness and usefulness of a course. The majority of pre-service teachers believed cultural and ethnic differences did not hinder their professor. With such a cultural change taking place in K-12 classrooms, pre-service teachers must possess attitudes fitting for a global society. It is with hope that this study will lead to further investigation of student's attitudes and perceptions in cross-cultural pedagogical environments. Teacher education programs must move beyond superficial issues of diversity and engage in a more active assessment of preconceived attitudes towards race and diversity.

At a seminar celebrating the tenth anniversary of that program, a recently-appointed member of the Pool presented this paper analyzing his perceptions of its nature and operation - from his unique perspective as the only North American resident involved in it. The presentation offers a trans-Atlantic comparative consideration of the program's fundamental purpose (quality improvement rather than consumer protection), its principal method (with reference to the evaluating agent, review scope, and participant motivation - distinguishing between accreditation systems and quality cultures), and the differing orientations through which various constituents can influence its effectiveness. The paper outlines and assesses the author's early experience in the program, which is largely positive - but proceeds as well to identify several areas of possible concern pertaining both to the European approach to quality assurance in higher education and to this EUA program for reviewing it at the institutional level.",

        "description":"Presented at a 2005 Salzburg Seminar symposium on the management and support of university research, this paper examines a number of staffing issues concerning institutional capacity-building to foster research in higher education. Various categories of staff engaged in the research enterprise are identified and the diversity among them in terms of role expectations, professional qualifications, and attitudinal orientations are discussed. The flexibility that must characterize the variety of forms their assignments can take is examined, as is the complexity of effectively supervising their performance. The challenges of motivating staff to engage in the research function are noted, and the range of sanctions and incentives that must be considered for different employee categories is explored. The various forms of support necessary to nurturing staff commitment to research in universities are outlined - including information about policies, priorities, and practices; moral support in the form of leadership commitment, mission articulation, and reward systems; and operational support through financial allocation, professional development, and physical resources. It is concluded that the complexity of these various staffing issues is multiplied by the inevitable interactions among them.",

        "description":"Critiquing arguments from the \"small school\" movement in cities such as New York and Chicago, this paper provides a basis for making sense of the apparent divergence in policies governing schooling structures in rural and urban places. Its interpretation examines the way the urban small schools movement works to valorize (and hence draw support from) the prevailing political consensus, which favors charter schools and standards-based reform. Small rural schools, by contrast, tend to represent traditional arrangements, both in political and pedagogical terms; and reformers tend to see such schools as \"backward\" and corrupt. These judgments, based primarily on political and ideological grounds, attend little to the empirical findings about school size, which tend to show that small schools confer advantages in all locales to all but the highest-SES students.",

        "description":"In a geopolitical context, the means of establishing deterrence is premised on the military capability of a country and the perceived willingness of a leader to use force as a means to achieve policy goals. A key function of rhetoric is to establish the personal ethos of a leader regarding their willingness to use force. During the Cold War the rhetorical context of geopolitical discourse was premised on a rational choice model of decision-making based on a strategic calculation of the relative strength of each country. This paper argues that rhetorical strategies need to change relative to the strategic situation facing each leader. Further, the rhetorical burden of building and maintaining strategic credibility inversely increases relative to a country's military power. This paper explores Richard Nixon's innovative rhetorical strategy of cultivating irrationality and uncertainty as a means to maintain and enhance \"deterrent credibility\" during a period of national decline.",

        "author":["Jones, Nathan Brian"],
        "description":"In a debate in the Forum section of the &quot;TESOL Quarterly&quot;, Jones and Silva (1998) exchanged views about the merits and demerits of teacher-assigned themes and topics in tertiary-level EFL/ESL writing classes. However, much more remains to be explored. Should teachers assign the topics of papers, or even the content themes for the entire course, to writing students? Or should students be encouraged to develop their own topics and themes? How much control of course content should a writing teacher have? How much autonomy should students have? How might decisions in response to these questions affect learning? This research explored these issues from the students' point of view by examining Taiwanese students' perspectives about the assignment of paper topics in an English writing class. Fifty-five writing students majoring in English at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) responded to open-ended written surveys. Applying the qualitative technique of the Constant Comparative Method of data analysis, the researcher grouped the raw data into emergent categories. The results support limits to learner autonomy within writing classes. NTHU students mostly preferred assigned paper topics, as they reported a need for the teacher to guide them in the early stages of preparing to write. The implications suggest that writing teachers should work with students carefully to interpret teacher-assigned writing prompts and, over time, to develop in students the skills needed to discover paper topics appropriate for tertiary-level courses. Suggestions for further research are included.",

        "author":["Malkani, Joanne M.",
          "Allen, James D."],
        "description":"A major reason for the use of cases in teacher education is based on the assumption that preservice teachers, via discussion of cases, will reflect on how educational theory can inform practice and when these students enter the classroom they will be better prepared for the realities of the classroom and will critically analyze their practices to improve students' learning by applying sound theories to classroom situations. Research supports that preservice teachers do become more reflective about teaching and classroom issues when exposed to cases (Allen, 1994; Lundberg, Levin & Harrington, 1999; Moje & Wade, 1997). However, it is unclear if students exposed to cases behave differently once they enter the classroom than those students not exposed to cases. In our use of cases to develop good reflective-practitioners, we seem successful in the \"reflective\" part, but do cases have enough \"staying power\" to also be successful in developing the \"practitioner\" part? That is the purpose of this study. This study investigated the longitudinal effects of using case studies (compared to another reflective learning activity and traditional instruction) in an undergraduate educational psychology course on the subsequent student-teaching practices of preservice teachers. Eighty-two students and their cooperating and supervising teachers were surveyed regarding the student-teachers' levels of reflection-in-practice during their student-teaching experience. Both qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed from 261 surveys. Findings indicate that students from case study and reflective journal groups demonstrated more reflective-practitioner qualities than students from the traditional lecture group. The following are appended: (1) Student Teaching Survey; (2) Responses to Question 1 based on Student Teacher Surveys; (3) Summary for Question 1; (4) Responses to Question 4 based on Student Teacher Surveys; (5) Summary for Question 4 based on Student Teacher Surveys; (6) Responses to Question 5 based on Student Teacher Surveys; (7) Summary for Question 5 based on Student Teacher Surveys; and (8) Comparisons between ST-CT-SupT for Questions #1, #4, #5.",

This paper concludes that to attain IT-literacy and computer literacy would mean to have a capacity to monitor changes and contribute to the development of the IT of the Republic of Croatia. Every individual, and especially those who deal in education and training should invest into their education on a lifetime basis, as, otherwise they might, instead of playing an active role, become only passive bystanders that act as &quot;brakes&quot; in guiding and directing the young (children, students) in their life-cycle curriculum.

        "description":"On the way to enter the European educational space, the Croatian higher educational system attempts to come to terms with the conclusions of the Bologna Declaration and undertake the reform of the higher education of the Republic of Croatia and introduce the ECTS points- system. Intensive activities in connection with the making of the new educational concept have been under way at the teacher training colleges, in order to achieve the reform of curriculums taking into consideration a few basic principles: single-semestral courses, multidisciplinarity, 3+2+3 or 4+1 study model implementation (pre-graduate, graduate and postgraduate), students' and teachers' mobility or better to say the internationalisation of teaching in the European context. The intention is to ensure the smoothness of studying and diploma acquiring (together with the diploma supplement) which would be valid throughout Europe. The work emphasises that this transformation and modernisation of curriculums shouldn't be done without the incorporation of the basic indicators of the educational quality that the EU prescribes, and one of them is the introduction of information contents, which have so far been represented to a small extent, in every curriculum at teacher training colleges. The results of the survey, carried among the students of teacher training colleges and higher schools, are also interpreted and talk about the students' insufficient level of information on actual changes of the higher education in the Republic of Croatia in the spirit of the Bologna Declaration.

This workshop presenter constructed two inventories to help those individuals who have been traumatized and those who help them. He integrated his professional experiences with information from the literature to create the inventories that can be used as self-inventories or as inventories as part of an interview. The first inventory includes how a person is coping cognitively, emotionally, interpersonally, physically, behaviorally, and spiritually. The second involves how a traumatized person is using and might use practical, physical, psychological, interpersonal, and/or spiritual, coping resources. The purpose of these inventories is to assist the traumatized person and/or the mental health professional to introspect and to determine coping strengths and weaknesses.

        "description":"The issue of whether or not to correct errors in students' writing is controversial. Some scholars argue that error correction is helpful, while others argue that it is ineffective, perhaps even harmful. What is missing from the literature are studies about how error correction might affect the performance of specific types of students. This study, which included 140 undergraduate English majors from Taiwan, examined the relationship between Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types on the effectiveness of one kind of error correction of writing. To identify their personality types, the students completed Form G of the MBTI. To determine their opinions about error correction of writing, the students wrote--at the beginning and the end of the two-semester course--in-class essays about whether or not they wanted to receive error correction of their writing. The purpose of this repetition, using a pre-test/post-test format, was to assist the researchers in the comparison of the students' self-reported opinions about error correction over time. In addition, the researchers compared improvement in students' written grammatical accuracy by the variables of self-reported error-correction preferences and MBTI personality types. The students also completed the grammar section of the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency (MTELP) at the beginning and the end of the course; its purpose was to double-check any gains in grammatical accuracy in the essays with the results of a standardized grammar assessment. Once the data were collected, the Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric data for chi-square results and the Siegel-Castellan formula for determining differences between ranked means were applied to look for patterns of differences among MBTI personality types about the effectiveness of error correction. All of the 16 MBTI personality types were found among the 140 undergraduate English majors included in this study. Although most of the students preferred receiving extensive error correction, and benefited from it at a statistically significant level, four MBTI personality types did not prefer it. What is more, for the four types, receiving extensive error correction against their expressed preferences did not help them to improve. These findings applied to both the essay and the MTELP results. Based upon the results of this study, the researchers recommend that teachers, when considering the correction of students' errors, should also consider carefully the self-reported error-correction preferences of students.

The present investigation represents the first two waves of an ongoing investigation of TF in a graduate elementary education program. The TF begin the program during the summer by participating in two education courses and a field experience. In the fall, they are placed as full-time teachers in low performing schools. For the next two years, the TF teach full-time during the day and take two masters level education courses in the afternoon or evenings. Upon completion of their final college course and the end of their obligation to the TF program, the TF were given a survey that focused on many aspects of their experience. Survey results indicate that approximately 29 percent of TF intend to leave their current teaching position at the end of their contractual obligation. This report focuses on how the TF perceptions of the schools' socioeconomic status, the perception of support received from fellow teachers and the principals within the schools, the beliefs they hold about the efficacy of their teaching practices and their beliefs about pupil control in a classroom setting impact on their plan to remain teaching in their current setting. Pearson product-moment correlations revealed that socioeconomic status, administrative support and feelings of general teaching efficacy all correlated with the TF long-term goal of continuing to teach in their present setting. Utilizing a stepwise regression analysis, feelings of general teaching efficacy were found to significantly predict the TF plan to remain teaching in their current school. Findings from this investigation point to the need to build in more support for the TF in order to keep them in the positions they have been trained for.",

        "description":"This study compares various approaches for incorporating family risk factors in explanatory models of children's achievement over the first 4 years of school. Living in poverty, in a single-parent household, in a household whose primary home language is non-English, and having a mother with less than a high school diploma are well-known risk factors related to lower achievement in reading and mathematics. This study examined three analytic approaches for describing children's level of family risk factors: 1) a cumulative risk index; 2) the four individual risk factor variables; and 3) unique combinations of the four risk factors, represented by a set of dummy-coded variables. Findings are based on a nationally representative sample of 10,345 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) who were first-time kindergartners in the fall of 1998. Data come from parent interviews in the fall of kindergarten and individual child assessments in reading and mathematics in the fall and spring of kindergarten, spring of first grade, and spring of third grade. A series of hierarchical linear models (HLM) were conducted to compare the relationships between each of the three risk factor approaches and children's initial achievement status and growth over the first 4 years of school in reading and mathematics. Results indicate that the unique combinations of risk factors present at kindergarten entry yielded more specific information on the relationship between family risks and achievement outcomes than the other approaches of using a cumulative risk index or using the individual risk factors as predictors. Children from single-parent households and those whose primary home language was non-English began school, on average, with lower achievement than children with no risks; however, if they had no other risk factors they tended to have higher initial scores and make greater growth over the first 4 years of school than children who's mothers did not complete high school. This study also found that children whose only risk factor was living in a home where English was not the primary home language had lower initial scores in mathematics but made greater growth over the first 4 years, in essence narrowing the achievement gap. Furthermore, increases in the number of risk factors were not always associated with greater achievement differences. Findings indicate that researchers should account for the specific combinations of risk factors present when exploring relationships between family background and student outcomes.

        "description":"Due to many of the stresses and societal challenges that African American parents face, parents who have children with antisocial behaviors need guidance and support to assist them with their children in the areas of parenting, academics, and social support. This study proposed a program that focuses on the parents and caregivers as vital persons in the prevention, intervention, rehabilitation, and therapeutic solution for these children. Strategies include an umbrella of faith-based Christian principles. The setting was a Christian church located in an urban community within a large city on the east coast of the United States. The Students Achieve When Families Have Faith, Inspiration, Resources, and Education Program was an 8-week program providing parents with training in the areas of child development instruction, communications skills training, social skills, and spiritual support. The sample population included 11 African American parents between the ages of 22-55. Additionally, 93% of the participants were single parents, 5% were married with 2-parent families, and 2% of the participants were grandparents. Parent assessments were in the areas of parenting-related stress, self-esteem, and perceived social support using the Parenting Stress Index, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), respectively. Anecdotal data were collected through focus group discussions, Parent Cooperative group discussions, and informal interviews. Quantitative data reflected that overall parent levels of self-esteem slightly increased but remained moderately high, based on the RSE from pretest to posttest with a t-score of -1.747. Parenting-related stress increased insignificantly from the pretest to the posttest with a t-score of 0.338. Finally, perceived social support increased insignificantly based on the MSPSS from the pretest to the posttest with a t-score of 0.199. The anecdotal data revealed more impressive positive relationships between the treatment and the outcomes with consistent increases in self-esteem and perceived social support and a decrease in parent-related stress. Overall, the program was successful and the applied dissertation effectively met more than half of the expected outcomes. Faith-based organizations should review the findings of this applied dissertation to develop more programs that incorporate instructional training with faith-based principles to address the needs of parents first. Appended are: (1) Overview of the SAFFIRE Program: Instructional and Faith-Based Program Components; (2) Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Letter of Intent; and (3) Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.

Multiple instrumental case study methods were used to document the managerial actions of selected teachers who made extensive use of cooperative learning (CL) activities. Four teachers in three elementary grade classrooms (two teachers team taught a combined 2nd and 3rd grade class) were selected for further study from a larger sample of 13 teachers. Criteria for teacher selection were based on observations of student engagement and group productivity in the spring of the preceding year. Observations were conducted on 5 to 7 occasions in each chosen teacher's classroom, commencing on the first day of school, except in one class in which group activities were not begun until the second week. Most observations were an hour to an hour and a half in length, and included one or more group activities. After several observations were completed, each teacher was interviewed in order to obtain the teacher's perspective about the use of cooperative learning groups. Additional observations were made later in the school year. Analyses revealed several important features of implementing CL, including planning room arrangement and other aspects of the physical layout to accommodate group work, organizing activities, teaching students procedures and routines for working in groups, and monitoring group activities. The case studies illustrate how effective teachers established their productive CL settings, and the findings should be useful to teachers and teacher educators interested in using CL activities.",

With greater uniformity, is there a loss of innovation and program identity? To gather information on this question, we examined teacher preparation programs in Elementary Education, Secondary English, Secondary Mathematics and Special Education at three Virginia institutions of higher education: the College of William and Mary, James Madison University, and the University of Virginia. Multiple data sources were used to collect information about program policies and practices, including program documents, interviews and focus groups. Interviews and focus groups were used to verify the accuracy and importance of the written documentation in each program. The findings of our review substantiate continued program and institutional variations in numerous areas despite the establishment of specific standards for preparation programs at the state level. Variations exist in areas such as length of program, types of required practicum experiences, number of required credits in professional education, number of credits/hours required for student teaching, number of required credits in major field of study, and nature of student teaching placement(s). Future research is needed to determine whether the areas of identified program variations help to account for differences in teacher effectiveness and ultimately the achievement of those they instruct.

        "description":"Background: Although there are many high-quality models for program and evaluation planning, these models are often too intensive to be used in situations when time and resources are scarce. Additionally, there is little added value in using an elaborate and expensive program and evaluation planning procedure when programs are small or are planned to be short-lived. Purpose: To meet the need for simplified models for program and evaluation planning, we describe a model that includes only the most essential outcomes-based program and evaluation planning steps. Evaluation Design: The four steps described in this article include: (1) how to create a logic model that shows how the program is causally expected to lead to outcomes, (the role of mechanisms, moderating mechanisms, and links between mechanisms are discussed); (2) how to use the logic model to identify the goals and objectives that the program is responsible for; (3) how to formulate measures, baselines, and targets from the goals and objectives; and (4) how to construct program activities that align with program targets. Examples from a computer-science-oriented HIV/AIDS prevention project are given for each step. Conclusions: The model described in this article is less time-consuming and resource intensive than other full-scale models but is still within the realm of good practice in program and evaluation planning.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to descriptively and comparatively analyze national and Ohio data of doctoral degree recipients from 1992-2002. Specifically, the study examined the following: (1) Compared trends of the number of doctoral degree recipients: National and Ohio composite Data (2) Compared trends of the number of doctoral degree recipients: National and Ohio Data within ethnicity (3) Compared trends of the number of doctoral degree recipients: National and Ohio Data within Ethnicity &amp; same Gender (4) Compared trends of the number of Doctoral degree Recipients: National and Ohio Data within Ethnicity &amp; across Gender (5) Examined the trends of number of Doctoral Degree recipients in Ohio by institutions (6) Examined the trends of the contribution of Ohio to the National pool of Doctoral degree recipients. (Research question) How well is Ohio doing compared to the national trend regarding the number of doctoral degree recipients from 1992 -2002? (Procedure) Four main tables were developed for this study. The first table relates to the national data of doctoral degree recipients by ethnicity and gender. The second table relates to the Ohio data of doctoral degree recipients by ethnicity and gender. The third table relates to the Ohio data of doctoral degree recipients by ethnicity, gender, and institution. The fourth table dealt with the percentage contribution Ohio makes to the national pool of doctoral degree recipients. There were forty two graphs. The graphs helped shed more light on the trends and the descriptive analysis of this study. (Results and Conclusions) The Ohio trend is not radically different from the national trend of doctoral degree recipients. Both trends are in a decreasing pattern. However there are some few differences when the data is broken down in terms gender and ethnicity. By and Large, Ohio is doing just as good as the rest of nation in the number of doctoral degree graduates. The contribution Ohio makes to the national pool of doctoral degree recipients remained relatively consistent for the target decade. (Contains 7 tables and 42 figures.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to use realistically simulated data to evaluate various CAT designs for use with the verbal reasoning measure of the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). Factors such as item pool depth, content constraints, and item formats often cause repeated adaptive administrations of an item at ability levels that are not matched to its difficulty, in which case the model-data misfit, if existing, might contribute to bias in examinees? final ability estimates since the data generated from the model might not represent the real response patterns of examinees. By incorporating the model-data misfit into adaptive testing simulations, this study introduced a simulation methodology in a real-world situation to address this important issue. The CAT simulations that were carried out suggested that measurement precision equivalent to the current paper-and-pencil MCAT Verbal Reasoning test could be achieved with a 32-item adaptive test based on the 2-PL or 3-PL models. Although the 2-PL and 3-PL simulations made slightly less uniform use of the item pools, the differences between these models and the 1-PL model were surprisingly small.  The results showed that when there was considerable amount of model data misfit, the model-based simulations gave smaller CSEMs at certain ability levels, which are misleading.  The empirically-based simulations provided a more reliable way of evaluating a CAT design before it's implementation. An administration of a 2-PL CAT with reliability comparable to P&amp;P reliability using almost half the P&amp;P test length is a very positive finding of the study.  The use of a 2-PL instead of a 3-PL model is recommended because of the simplicity of the 2-PL model. (Contains 37 tables.)

The need to differentiate and re-thinking education and learning, both within and outside the school system, is gaining increased attention among education researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners. This paper tries to present a careful analysis of current trends and challenges in education and focuses on the policies of education for the 21st century in both developed and developing countries. Emphasis is placed here on the educational reform plan for the 21st century in Japan and the educational policies of Persian Gulf Countries. 1) The objective is to examine what &quot;we&quot; can learn from Japanese approach and experience in promotion of the educational reform plan for the 21st century named &quot;Rainbow Plan&quot; the seven priority strategies. In section I, the major trends that the world faces in the twenty-first century are concerned. In section II, the economic and social situation of the Persian Gulf Region will be examined. Section III deals with major challenges the educational systems are facing both in the world and the Persian Gulf Region. In the following section IV, I will analyze the Japan's educational goals in the 21st century. In section V, the Japanese educational reform plan for the 21st century named &quot;Rainbow Plan&quot; the seven priority strategies is discussed. In the last section VI, I would like to deal with a number of lessons which the Persian Gulf countries can learn from Japanese approach in promoting their educational reform plans.",

        "description":"This monograph contains 13 self-contained brief treatises that comprise material on linguistic, historical and cultural studies of the extinct American Indian languages of southeastern New England. These Indian languages, and their dialects, were once spoken principally in the States of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. They are called &quot;Massachusett&quot; and &quot;Narragansett.&quot; These Indian tongues are a subset of a larger group of about three dozen Indian languages called the Algonquian language family. The manuscript summarizes work over the past decade relating to the documentation, analysis and reconstruction of these lost and sleeping American Indian languages. The primary focus is comparative Algonquian vocabulary and elementary grammatical structures, derived from the scholarly linguistic and anthropological literature, oral tradition, and the authors own (hypothetical) reconstructive contributions. The objective of the manuscript is to reach a diverse audience interested in these old Indian languages. As such, its approach is quasi-historical, linguistic and phenomenological. Each chapter contains vocabularies and extensive grammatical notes relating to individual topical areas. The following chapters are included: (1) The Word &quot;Squaw&quot; in Historical and Modern Sources; (2) Spirits &amp; Family Relations; (3) Animals and Insects; (4) Birds and Fowl; (5) Muhhog: The Human Body; (6) Fish and Aquatic Animals; (7) Corn, Fruit, Berries &amp; Trees; (8) The Heavens, Weather, Winds, Time; (9) Algonquian Prayers and Miscellaneous Algonquian Indian Texts; (10) Prolegomena to Nukkone Manittowock in that Part of America Called New-England; (11) Guide to Historical Spellings &amp; Sounds in the Extinct New England American Indian Languages Narragansett-Massachusett; (12) Bringing Back Our Lost Language: Geistod in That Part of America Called New-England; and (13) At the Powwow.

Biology faculty can realize the many practical benefits of RCBr as a model organism with known genotype and phenotype for student research in the lab and in the field. One area of investigative student experience that is significantly lacking, is the development of ecological investigations using Fast Plants. Here, I demonstrate how I incorporated Fast Plants into three college courses to provide students with: (1) An authentic and enriching research experience.

        "author":["Davis, Wes",
          "Mahoney, Kelley"],
        "description":"This experimental, statistical study investigated the effects that the testing of grammar and writing mechanics would have on the overall quality and reduction of errors in college students' essays for freshman composition. In the experimental group of 42 students, the professor assigned several exercises in grammar and mechanics as a review related to composing skills and then gave two major tests on proofreading essays for grammatical errors. However, the other professor did not give these grammar tests to the 41 students in the control group. The study used \"T-tests\" for statistical analysis on pretest and posttest essays, which each of the 83 students had written. On overall writing quality, the faculty raters holistically scored the students' essays, using a scale from 1 (failing) to 4 (superior). Since the two raters scored each student's pretest and posttest essay, each essay had a combined score resulting in a scale from 2 (failing) to 8 (superior). The results showed that the 42 students of the experimental group who tested on grammar had a mean pretest essay score of 2 and a mean posttest essay score of 4.53, showing a gain of 2.53. Statistically, these students made very highly significant gains in overall writing quality. The 41 students of the control group not tested on grammar had a mean pretest essay score of 2.66 and a posttest score of 4.49, showing a gain of 1.83. These students also made very highly significant gains in overall writing quality, although the experimental group's posttest essay scores were still significantly higher than the control groups. On traditionally serious grammatical errors, the experimental group had a mean number of 1.5 serious errors on the pretest essay and a mean number of 0.93 error on the posttest, a reduction of 0.57 which was statistically significant. The control group's mean number on the pretest essay was 1.23 serious errors and a mean posttest number of 0.64 error, a reduction of 0.59 which was also significant; however, there was no significant difference between both groups in the reduction of serious errors. For the less serious \"minor\" errors, the experimental group had a mean number of 7.4 minor errors on the pretest essay and a mean number of 5.12 errors on the posttest essay, a reduction of 2.28 errors which was highly significant. The control group had a mean pretest essay number of 12.5 minor errors and a mean posttest essay number of 7.42 errors, a reduction of 5.08 errors which was very highly significant. Moreover, statistics showed a significant difference between both groups' posttest essays in the reduction of these minor errors, with the control group making more significant reductions in the minor errors than the experimental group. The researchers concluded that the two major grammar tests on proofreading two essays for errors may have had some effect on the experimental group's gains in overall writing quality for correctness. However, these tests appeared to make no difference between both groups, by having very little if any effect on the students in the experimental group to reduce the number of errors significantly in their essays.

Examinees were categorized according to 4 item response time patterns, and the categories are compared in terms of ability estimates. Significant differences between response time patterns were observed. Highest ability estimates were associated with a response time pattern that was consistent across items, while lowest ability estimates were associated with long response times on items early in the test and short response times late in the test. These results suggest that teaching examinees to manage time effectively can maximize ability estimates. An alternative interpretation is that more able examinees require less time to respond to items. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of three basic demographic variables on reading test scores for students in the middle elementary grades. Limited English proficiency (LEP), race/ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES) were studied to determine their influence individually and in combination on performance in large-scale assessment programs. Two data sets were analyzed: 1. Grade 4 reading results for the 2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and 2. Grades 3 and 5 reading results for the 2003 Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment (MCA). The NAEP data contains results for over 179,000 students and the MCA data files consist of results for approximately 60,000 students at each grade level. The NAEP results were analyzed both for the overall national public school sample and for the 50 state-level jurisdictions. The overall NAEP results indicate that all three variables have a significant effect upon  reading scores. There are large &quot;gaps&quot; in average test scores among racial/ethnic groups, LEP and Non-LEP students and students eligible and not eligible for the federal free and reduced lunch program. The joint effect of the variables is shown by the fact that the racial/ethnic gaps are dramatically reduced when students are cross-classified by SES and LEP status. The state-level NAEP data reveal a pattern of strong negative correlations between the percent of students in each state eligible for free and reduced lunches and mean state NAEP scores. A similar pattern was observed in the correlation of percent of students classified as LEP for Hispanic and Asian student mean scores. The MCA data showed results parallel to the NAEP data. The gaps between White and Hispanic and White and Asian students were shown to be largely attributable to the incidence of LEP students in the two minority groups. Our analyses clearly demonstrate that reports of &quot;achievement gaps&quot; in assessment results are misleading if SES and LEP status are not taken into consideration.

The target population consisted of career and technical education teachers employed by West Virginia Department of Education during 2004-2005 academic school year. The data suggest that professional development programs provided less than adequate provisions of NCLB to CTE teachers. It appears that selected CTE teachers were less than cognizant that the NCLB Act does not reduce local control of schools. In this study, the following demographic variables may serve as good predictors of CTE teachers' perceptions toward the impact of the NCLB Act: program area, age, years of teaching experience, level of education, and years of related work experience prior to teaching. Overall, career and technical education teachers' perceptions toward teacher quality and parental choices appeared to be mixed. On the other hand, CTE teachers were more likely to support local control and assessment provisions for the NCLB Act. Teacher educators and State Department of Education personnel should spend more time to address weaknesses of the NCLB Act as perceived by CTE teachers in this study. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"One of the primary means of evaluating teaching effectiveness in higher education is through the use of end-of-term student ratings of teacher performance. A number of universities have begun experimenting with replacing the traditional paper and pencil rating forms with on-line forms. Because student ratings often play a key role in personnel decisions, a study was conducted to evaluate the comparability of two methods of on-line rating with traditional paper-and-pencil ratings. A total of 53 students enrolled in one section of a course taught by a single instructor were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. One group completed traditional paper forms. The second group completed on-line forms as a class in a computer lab. The third group completed on-line forms independently. The primary difference in outcomes suggested by the data was not between paper-and-pencil and online groups, but rather between the groups that completed the ratings in whole-class vs. independent contexts.

        "description":"The purpose of this presentation was to examine the Niagara Movement as the initiator of a new tactic of Black protest that had its inception in 1905 with the creation of this movement. To further understand the impact of this movement, the factors which led to the creation of this movement were explored, an analysis of the purpose, history, failure and lasting effects were studied. Results indicate that the strengths were limited because: (1) it lacked the support of Booker T. Washington, the leading African American of the day and (2) it was an all-Black movement, which lacked the resources to be successful. On the other hand, the movement did give birth to the national mass protest movement which included whites and was a marked departure from the previous efforts and led to the creation of numerous national organizations. Some of these were the National Associational for the Advancement for Colored People (NAACP), 1909; the Urban League, 1910; March On Washington Movement (MOWM), 1940-41; Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE), 1972; Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLS), 1957; Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), 1960 and others. Seminal to this presentation was the debate between the advocate for a liberal arts education and the advocate for equality of his race, Dr. W.E. B. DuBois, and Booker T. Washington, founder of Tuskegee Institute who advocated an industrial education and a public conciliatory tone toward race matters. The stance taken by these two intellectuals continues to be discussed and debated. Their impact on African American and American societies, especially because of the controversial nature of their opinions, and impact on the education of African Americans are worthy of further study. Moreover, the revelation that Booker T. Washington secretly funded NAACP cases to help tear down the system he publicly support warrants more investigation. The stances of those two gentlemen continue to stir heated debate about their roles in history and there is a need for an objective look at the two outstanding African Americans with differing views.",

The program, a personal initiative, adapts primary features of the treatment offered by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for clients suffering from fears and phobias. CBT strategies include progressive desensitization, identifying and challenging negative thoughts, creating and rehearsing positive replacement thoughts, and structured visualizations) Unlike many programs developed to help students overcome Speech Anxiety in a college classroom, the \"Fear and Loathing\" program is not an isolated instructional module. It is integrated into a basic public speaking course throughout the semester so that it does not take away time from such content and skills-based instruction as how to create a preparation outline and how to deliver a presentation. In fact, the strategies used in the \"Fear and Loathing\" program to overcome \"stage fright,\" (aka communication or public speaking anxiety) also reinforce content and skills acquisition. These strategies for overcoming \"stage fright\" are introduced progressively in the course, throughout the semester, progressing in the same way a typical course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for a single client leads to its goal usually an average time period of sixteen weeks, according to the official website for the National Association of Cognitive Behavioral Therapists (NACBT). This is also the approximate length of time for a college semester. In sum, the \"Fear and Loathing\" program adapts a typical cognitive behavioral therapeutic experience for a single client--in length of time, progressive use of strategies, and \"homework\" assignments--to a group, classroom setting.",

        "description":"A great deal of the variance in student achievement, motivation, and engagement is explained at the student level. This poses a challenge to educators who typically educate at a group level. This article proposes \"pastoral pedagogy\" as a key means by which educators can facilitate an individual student's personal connection to teaching and learning in the group setting. The more an individual student can personally connect to the teaching and learning, the more motivated and engaged he or she is proposed to be. Pastoral pedagogy is comprised of three key dimensions: the substantive dimension (relating to the subject matter taught and assessed), the interpersonal dimension (relating to the teacher him or herself), and the pedagogical dimension (relating to the teaching practice). When the student is personally connected to all three dimensions, it is proposed he or she is in the strongest position to engage with the teaching and learning taking place. Hence, a great lesson is something like a great musical composition, comprising the song, the singer, and the singing. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

This study analyzes the ranking system implemented by the ADE that categorizes all public schools according to ridged educational characteristics. While standardized test scores and dropout statistics are touted by many as solid examples of aspects by which schools should be judged, this work presents multiple alternative social trends that are overlooked in the ranking process. Publicly accessible data is used to demonstrate commonalities between all Arizona high schools that reported test scores for language-minority students during the 2003-2004 school year.  Instead of ranking schools according to a single monolithic system, environmental factors such as school size, teacher turn over ratio, and the socioeconomic level of the surrounding community need to be seen as significantly contributing to the overall level of student achievement. This paper contains various tables based on data taken from the ADE website. Furthermore, the bibliography includes eleven academic sources. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Results have shown that the participant Turkish online mentors agree on the significance of the assessor, the content expert and process facilitator roles; on the other hand, they indicate lower level of necessity for the material producer and the administrator roles.

        "description":"With the advent of globalization and the proliferation of online learning, the creation of culturally sensitive online learning environments takes on increasing importance. Online education provides new opportunities for learners from different cultural backgrounds to come together, learn, expand their knowledge, share ideas, and develop passion for their vocation. Emerging models of how communities work, such as Communities of Practice (CoPs) are being increasingly used to understand how online communities might grow and develop. Schwen &amp; Hara (2003) outline 4 stages of design necessary to ensure that CoPs are properly designed for an online environment: phase (1) Possible Design Interventions, phase (2) Analysis, phase(3) Design and, phase (4) Evaluation and Revision. Phase 1 and phase 2 of this design model are considered in this study, in light of Etienne Wenger's (2002) elements of a Community of Practice: domain, community and practice. These elements are considered in order to gauge the degree to which they can be applied in an Arab educational culture. The investigation focuses on College-level education in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the government-supported Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) system. By analyzing faculty perceptions related to the students' propensity to adopt Community of Practice elements into their educational culture, we can provide guidance for the design of online learning that supports a cross-cultural Community of Practice, specifically as it relates to phase 1 and phase 2 of Schwen and Hara's design structure.

It is based on Professor Gilly Salmon's five-stage networked learning model and builds on a history of e-learning initiatives at the University. Salmon's work provided a framework that not only emphasises the pedagogy of e-learning but provides a means of deeper engagements with e-learning--both in terms of interaction with participation and integration into the blend of courses. In comparing data from such courses run at the University (including colleagues across the UK) and the Middle East cohort, cultural differences were anticipated. The findings suggest, however, that factors such as comfort and familiarity with the medium were more influential than culture.

        "author":["Kurubacak, Gulsun"],
        "description":"In considering how best to optimize distance education systems, economy (cost effectiveness and efficiency), technology (communication technologies) and equity (gender, accessibility, minority, language, religion etc.) are vital issues in any distance education systems. Moreover, how end-users, distance learners, can equally share and exchange knowledge and resources for educational purposes, how they can promote their higher-order thinking skills as well as how they can cope with the limitations they have (such as time, age, gender, language etc.) are major concerns in distance education milieus. Kurubacak strongly emphasizes that interactive radio programs, as a forgotten educational media, with a little cost can effectively integrate in any distance education systems. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to focus on interactive radio programs to build critical and creative knowledge networks among diverse learners in the distance education systems of developing countries.",

Two groups of counselors (N = 69) were compared in terms of their personality profile. One group, consisting of 48% of the participants, was comprised of novice counselors (licensed at the entry-level). The other group, consisting of 52% of the participants, was comprised of experienced counselors (licensed at the advanced level). Results indicate significant differences between the two groups in the Factor of Openness and the Facets of Vulnerability, Feelings, and Trust. Results show that experienced counselors have significantly higher levels of Openness, Feelings, and Trust and have significantly lower levels of Vulnerability. Counselor Educators and Counseling Supervisors need to increase their knowledge of the individual personality differences typically found between novice and experienced counselors, especially for those experienced counselors who provide clinical supervision to novice counselors, as these can have an impact on the supervisory working alliance.

        "description":"The present study aimed at identifying the democratic practices that can be followed in the EFL university classes and investigating their effect on the students' attitude towards the English language learning at the postgraduate level. A democratic practices list was identified. These practices were followed in EFL classes all the academic year by both the students and/or the instructor. A democratic practices scale of 40 items was developed and administered to the students to rate them. Another scale of 12  items was developed to examine the effect of using the democratic practices on the students' attitude towards English language course. The findings of the first scale showed that the democratic practices were followed and practiced in EFL classes during the academic year 2003-2004. Four items of freedom of self-expression were agreed to by the students without gender differences. Eleven items of the mutual respect dimension, except item number 2: &quot;The instructor used tough utterances in his treatment with students in the EFL classes&quot;, five items of taking responsibility, three of taking decisions, six items of equality, six items of justice dimension and 3 items of common interest dimension were used and practiced in the EFL classes. Few gender differences had been reported. The second scale revealed that the students benefited very much from the English language course taught accompanying the democratic practices. All the students reported their positive attitudes towards leaning the EFL classes because they were very useful to them. Appended are: (1) 40-item democratic practices scale written in Arabic; and (2) 12-item attitude scale written in Arabic. (Contains 10 tables.)",

        "description":"The current paper summarizes the problem of K-12 students' comprehension of text. In an effort to improve reader understanding the publishing industry has adopted numerous research-based recommendations to facilitate learning by including visual elements that supplement text: graphic organizers; pictures; graphics; and digital audio and video supplements. Numerous research studies support the supplementary use of visual/video and audio adjunct elements to support students' learning of content. Despite these improvements a major dilemma remains: How can text seamlessly intertwine with digital content? Separately packaged video, audio and computer programs fail to connect a reader immediately to digital content during the actual text-based reading process. One possible technological solution to this problem is Touch-User-Interface (TUI) paper-to-digital content books. \"Media-rich Paper\" consists of paper pages, exactly like those contained in a book, except that the paper lies on top of touch-sensitive panels programmed to connect instantly to the digital realm via a companion computer. Such a seamless connection might improve reading comprehension for all learners. A dual call is articulated for: (1) the development of this technology specifically for improving reading comprehension; and (2) the technical evaluation of the affect of TUI/\"Media-rich Paper\" on reading comprehension achievement.

        "description":"The purpose of this applied dissertation was to examine the effects of constructivist pedagogy when addressing the issues associated with below proficiency scores in basic skills in mathematics on the state exit exam. Scores of thirty-four 11th and 12th grade students who did not perform at the state-mandated levels of proficiency in basic skills in mathematics on the state exit exam were used for individualizing each of the student's instruction in the computer lab and for matching students together with strengths and weaknesses for peer-assisted instruction and group learning. Collaborative learning, cooperative learning, and computer-assisted instruction were used for a 16-week period. Results indicated that the applied dissertation program utilizing constructivist teaching strategies to improve mathematics outcomes for high school students was effective in two of the four identified outcomes. The program was effective in improving the scores of students repeating the state mandated exit exam and improving student motivation, however, the program was less effective in improving in-class achievement test scores. Nor was the program effective in improving classroom grades, in mathematics, of the students in the program. None-the-less, the pre- and post-test data did show an improvement for 91% of the students after implementation of the applied dissertation program. It is recommended that further research be completed using a student group not enrolled in a class set-up specifically for remediation of basic skills, that teacher in-service be provided on constructivist methods to enable the teachers to understand the importance of these methods and to correctly implement the use of them, that the class students are required to take, if they scored below standard on their first or second attempt on the mathematics subtest on the state mandated exit exam, be changed from a required elective to a suggested elective, and it is recommended that additional training be provided on technology use so that teachers can best provide programs that are tailored to the individual student's needs.

A forty-item instrument was developed probing teacher candidates? perceptions of their level of preparation for working with special populations in the general education classroom. Teacher candidates were surveyed at the end of three phases of teacher preparation (foundations, methods coursework and an introduction to student teaching, fulltime student teaching and advanced methodology) using the Flashlight tool developed by the Center for Teaching and Learning at Washington State University (http://www.ctlt.wsu.edu/). Results of the first phase of this study indicate that teacher candidates feel sufficient in their knowledge regarding the instruction of typically performing students throughout their preparation program. However, while teacher candidates feel their knowledge is sufficient regarding the instruction of special populations after foundational coursework, they feel less so after methods coursework and an introduction to student teaching. After a fulltime semester of student teaching and advanced methodology, teacher candidates perceive their knowledge is more sufficient than during their introductory semester, but not as high as they did after foundational coursework. Teacher candidates perceive the least sufficient knowledge for instructing students with special needs in all phases of their preparation program. Once teacher candidates engage in practice, they continue to perceive that their knowledge is sufficient in instructing typically performing students; however, they feel much less sufficient in instructing English Learners and students with special needs. Teacher preparation programs must continue to infuse more knowledge and skills for instructing students with special needs and English learners throughout program and eldwork. Further analysis as to the finding that teacher candidates perceived diminishing levels of sufficiency rather than increasing levels as they progressed through their program should be conducted.

        "description":"The distribution of person fit indices is not easy to describe in tests where the item sample is too small to conform to a theoretical asymptotic statistical distribution, particularly the normal N(0,1). In practice, it is always the fact and, consequently, it is difficult to get the critical percentile value indicating person misfit. First, we investigate if we obtain at least a N(Lz/OS/O) distribution of Lz conditional on the estimated proficiency level. In a second phase, we verify if it is possible to linearly predict the critical first and fifth percentiles of this same distribution by the estimated proficiency level and his standard error. Results of 2000 simulations of 85 fixed items tests at each of 23 simulated proficiency levels showed that the first percentile of the Lz distribution generally can't be predicted by a N(Lz/OS/O) distribution according to the related 23 estimated proficiency levels. The proficiency level was estimated with MLE, MAP, WLE, EAP and AEAP methods. More promising, the first and fifth percentiles of the Lz distribution were well predicted by a linear regression on the estimated proficiency level and his standard error (r&amp;gt;0.90), particularly with the MLE, WLE and AEAP methods. So, it is recommended to apply these last three methods. (Contains 16 tables and 6 figures.)",

The push by federal and state mandates, such as the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; Act and the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) have increased the amount of teaching and learning required of educators and students. As a result, administrators are continuously searching for and utilizing instructional approaches that are research-based, have a proven record of effectiveness and efficacy, and are able to meet the increasingly diverse academic needs of the general education population. The authors suggest that incorporating DI in the classroom may be the answer. A crucial element in the implementation of DI in most cases is change. A total embracement of direct instruction by administrators is necessary for DI to be effective in the classroom. This article discusses how administrators can effectively implement DI into their schools by providing definitions and examples of DI, discussing the types of DI available and providing examples of the cost of these materials, and addressing the role of the administrator in embracing DI in their districts.",

Using Social Cognitive Career Theory, we examined personality, medical specialty preferences, job satisfaction, and expectations about specialty choice to create a conceptual framework to guide specialty choice decision-making. Methods: Using an existing data set, the authors examined data on personality and medical specialty preference gathered from physicians (n=49). Personality was assessed using Personality Research Form (PRF) and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The Medical Specialty Preference Inventory (MSPI) assessed preference for six medical specialties. The authors also inquired about expectations for specialty choice and job satisfaction using survey research. Physicians responded utilizing a Likert scale to six statements regarding job satisfaction. Participants were asked to respond to questions about their expectations and the actual practice of their specialty. Results: Data analyses using Pearson R indicated no significant relationship between PRF factors and job satisfaction. Chi-square results of MBTI and specialty choice regarding job satisfaction were not significant. Chi-square results of the MSPI and job satisfaction were also not significant. Qualitative comments provided by participants about expectations and actual practice of specialty helped to explain level of job satisfaction.  These comments were categorized into twenty different themes. &quot;Personal Reward/Satisfaction,&quot; &quot;Time Commitment to Medicine&quot; and &quot;Balancing Personal and Professional Life&quot; offered current contextual influences on specialty choice behavior. Conclusions: Medical specialty decision-making has long been a perplexing process for medical students and behavioral researchers. This study looked to Social Cognitive Career Theory to explain the complex interplay between personality, specialty preference, job satisfaction and expectations regarding each of these influences individually on specialty choice and job satisfaction, no significant results were found.  A conceptual model is proposed and preliminary results support further testing of the model for medical specialty  decision-making.",

This study correlated entering students' personality and values scores with their professed interest in PC. 93 medical students completed instruments assessing personality (16PF & PSP), values, and specialty interests. Resulting scores were used to predict students' primary-care interest (PC) or non-interest (NPC) using logistic regression analysis. About 80% were correctly categorized into PC or NPC based on these variables. The strongest noncognitive predictor was Warmth, measured by either the standardized, psychological instrument (16PF) or the non-standardized, self-assessment survey (PSP). Dutifulness and Trusting Nature significantly added to PC prediction, if measured by the 16PF but not the PSP. When personality scores (16PF/PSP) were not entered into the analysis, service and prestige were significant predictors. These noncognitive variables were significant even after accounting for gender, race, and physician parents. Candidates describing themselves as warm and attentive to others during interviews or in their personal statements may be expressing an accurate self-assessment, because Warmth scores from both self-report and standardized measures similarly predicted PC interest. Predictive validity of these noncognitives throughout medical school should be examined. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Purpose: Despite medical schools having some system in place to review student progress and promote students (referred to hereafter as academic review and promotions; ARP), little research has been done with the purpose of understanding personality characteristics of the students who appear before an ARP committee or governing body. A recent study by Wear et al. (2004) sought to examine and understand how medical students experienced the ARP process from students' perspectives and described students' attitudes, beliefs, explanations, and orientations about the ARP process. Although Wear et al. investigated many factors related to the ARP process; personality was not one of them. The authors sought to further research in medical student persistence by investigating the role that personality plays in ARP appearances. Specifically, this exploratory study sought to determine if personality differences exist between medical students who appear before ARP and students who do not. Methods: The Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire  (16PF: Cattell, Cattell &amp; Cattell, 1993) was administered to 630 students during their first year of medical school. Of these students, 175 (100 males, 75 females) appeared before ARP one or more times. Results: An ANOVA, conducted to determine if personality differences existed between students who had appeared before ARP and students who did not, revealed no significant differences. Discussion: In aiding medical educators to better understand factors that explain which students are more likely to appear before ARP and their recidivism rate, personality does not seem to be among the non-cognitive factors. However, given that the 16PF provides only one measure of personality, future studies should consider using alternative measures to further investigate the role that personality may play in the ARP process. Additionally, in order to identify relevant themes, it is suggested that qualitative inquiry be used for follow-up studies. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Vocational identity is an important construct for physician career development. Physician vocational development has been grouped into three tasks (crystallization, specification, and implementation) pertaining to career choice and specialty choice (1) In defining the construct of vocational identity, it has been suggested that the relation between vocational behavior and personality be examined (2) To better understand the vocational development tasks of physicians and to learn about its relation to personality, the present study sought to examine personality factors of medical students who exhibit different career choice patterns based on vocational development tasks. It tested the hypothesis that medical students with different career choice patterns were significantly different with regard to personality. This study compared personality factors of four groups of 155 first-year medical students who exhibited different career choice patterns based on the results of the Medical Career Development Inventory (MCDI). The MCDI and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) were group administered to entering medical students during orientation. Discriminant analysis determined the extent to which the four career pattern groups could be differentiated by the set of 16PF scores. Results showed that the personality factors of Social Boldness (Wilks' [lambda]=0.825, X2=29.00, p is less than 0.000) and Tension (Wilks' [lambda]=0.927, X2=11.48, p is less than 0.003) predicted differences between the groups. Specifically, medical students who had neither crystallized nor specified a career preference were less thick-skinned and socially bold than participants who had coped with one or both of the tasks. Additionally, medical students who had coped with the task of career crystallization, or who neither crystallized nor specified a career preference, were more tense, impatient and driven than participants who had coped with career specification or who had coped with both tasks. The findings of this study may provide information helpful in identifying students, based on certain personality characteristics, who are struggling with the vocational development tasks associated with becoming physicians. Appropriate interventions may then be designed and implemented by medical school advisors, counselors, and educators to assist medical students.",

It is a multisite project involving four US medical schools over a period of nearly ten years. The current study sought to test the hypothesis that relevant personality differences do exist between male and female medical students and discuss the implications of any such findings. Method: Two thousand one hundred and forty four first-year medical students (1008 females and 1136 males) at four medical schools completed the 16PF between 1995 and 2003. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to determine if significant gender differences existed for medical students on personality traits, as measured by the 16PF. Results of the MANOVA revealed significant differences (p< .05) for 12 of 16 factors. Conclusions: Results of this study revealed that distinct personality differences existed between male and female medical students. Results suggest that female medical students are more warm and outgoing (Warmth); more dutiful (Rule-Consciousness); more sensitive (Sensitivity); more self-doubting and worried (Apprehension); more organized and self-disciplined (Perfectionism); and more tense and driven (Tension) than their male counterparts. On the other hand, male medical students appear to be more adaptive and mature (Emotional Stability); more forceful and assertive (Dominance); more suspicious and skeptical (Vigilance); more imaginative and idea-oriented (Abstractedness); more private and discreet (Privateness); and more solitary and individualistic (Self-Reliance) as compared to female medical students. It is possible that revealed personality differences between male and female medical students may play a role in later choice of specialty. As such, future analyses of our data set will seek to determine the relationship between such gender differences and later choice of specialty. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"In its 2004 spring report, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) posits that Behavioral Sciences provides a perspective that can assist physicians in understanding their patients as embedded in a larger social and environmental context  (Patricia A. Cuff and Neal Vanselow, Editors, Improving Medical Education: Enhancing the Behavioral and Social Science Content of Medical School Curricula). The report further indicates that perspective and context is crucial to patient care in terms of understanding the interaction between biological, cognitive, and learning processes to produce behavior, illness and health. Perspective and context is equally important in understanding physician satisfaction. The authors present their findings from a qualitative research study at one northeastern medical college in which they explored factors influencing physician satisfaction. The authors describe responses from practicing physicians and how responses were categorized into twenty (20) themes. Categorized themes from the study include: academic side of medicine, balancing personal and professional life, business side of medicine, clinical issues within specialty, dissatisfaction with medicine, expectations of medicine, gender, geographical location, match, monetary rewards, personal rewards/ satisfaction,  politics within medicine, practice of medicine, pressures and demands, switching specialty/quitting medicine, stress associated with medicine, time commitments, training issues, full time/part time work, and other circumstances (i.e., military, locum tenums). The authors share \"rich\" examples from various themes found in the study. What are the implications of this study, specifically as it relates to behavioral science departments in American medical colleges? Participants in the study offer advice to medical students and faculty. The authors share this advice and solicit further suggestions for behavioral sciences from conference participants. The IOM recent report recommends that medical students demonstrate competency in one of six domains, including physician role and behavior. Physician well being is one of the high priority topics for inclusion in medical school curricula. Understanding physician satisfaction and assisting medical students in making informed choices about specialty choice is an important area for medical schools to examine. Including physician satisfaction and medical specialty choice in the behavioral sciences curriculum can also provide perspective and context about the complexity of medicine--a positive step towards physician well being.

Using qualitative data, the paper discusses the experiences of teachers in three schools placed on probation to understand the relationship between expectancy and leadership. The findings indicate a relationship between certain types of principal leadership (e.g., instructional leadership, support, and trust) and teacher expectancy.

Results of data analysis revealed that there were significant differences in the women's age and years of experience in the superintendency and how they perceived their uses of power. Interviews were conducted with nine of the women in the study and revealed that they believed their power increased when they shared or gave power away. Consistent with previous research, this study also found that women were hesitant and reluctant to speak about their power in their role as superintendents. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Consequently, there has been limited research focusing on understanding the position from a woman?s perspective. The purpose of this study was to add to the small body of literature focusing on women?s ideas and beliefs about leading schools. A survey consisting of a measure of perceived leadership practices and questions of demographics was sent to women public school superintendents practicing in four Midwestern states during the academic year, 2000-2001. In addition to the survey, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a small sample of women in the study. The study's framework was based on a model of leadership developed by Kouzes &amp; Posner (1995) and incorporated into The Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI) they developed and used in this study. The research questions asked if there were differences in how the women superintendents perceived their leadership practices based on age, years of administrative experience, and size and structure of their districts. Data analysis revealed that there were significant differences in perceived leadership practices according to size of school district. The study also revealed that women have ways to talk about how they have succeeded in their roles as superintendents. Also women in this study viewed relational leadership as a key component of their leadership style. New findings indicated that the women superintendents believed good hiring practices and specific qualities of a leader were essential elements to effective leadership.",

        "description":"An exploration of how year 12 students in a New Zealand high school make meaning of their experiences of different specialist IT (information technology) courses shows that gender identity is a potent factor in their experiences. At a personal level, individual students, males and females, construe their experiences of CPS (computer studies) and TIM (text and information management) courses differently. However, students tend to think of different computer activities as masculine and feminine practices. They imbue courses with masculine and feminine identities, depending on the type of computer applications, knowledge and skills that are emphasised in the courses. These are socially defined notions of computing activity as gendered practice. Also, students' experiences are tied up with ideas about what sort of computer practices are consistent with their developing and personal identities as male and female students of IT and computer users. This has implications and raises questions for those who are concerned with a perceived &quot;problem&quot; in the under representation of females in computer science and related courses. It suggests that the &quot;problem&quot; is more complex than it may initially appear. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

Results of a survey distributed in 1990 were compared to results of a similar survey distributed in the spring of 2004. Responses from principals to survey items dealing with the concept that adolescents are unique in reference to other age groups emotionally, intellectually, physically, and socially to the needs of implementing and sustaining middle school concepts were compared from 1990 and 2004. While some survey items showed no significant differences in the responses from the two groups, it may be possible to posit that the two groups of principals still feel that adolescents are unique compared to other age groups. Other survey items did display statistically significant differences between the two groups, which may suggest the stage of the middle level concept. Progress or the lack thereof has been noted with each survey item. Implications from this survey can serve to heighten awareness and continue to improve the quality of middle level education.

        "description":"Finding the right candidates for positions is a difficult task for employers. For job applicants obtaining the best positions available can also be challenging. One problem is the inherent weakness of one page cover letters, two page resumes, or short portfolios to present an applicant's talents thoroughly. One successful method of displaying a job hunter's talents to potential employers is the use of electronic career portfolios (Electronic portfolios). Electronic portfolios allow job hunters to showcase their talents for employers. However, the increased use of Electronic portfolios by students, job hunters, and employees in various occupations from teaching to graphic design, has resulted in similar content being included in portfolios. This similar content creates a dilemma for employers when attempting to distinguish one potential employee from another. A method that assists in distinguishing portfolios is the use of video clips to introduce the applicant and their work. The primary purpose of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of an instructional design module created to teach students how to add video to their Electronic portfolios. Graduate level students in an Educational Technology (ETEC) class, their instructor, and persons in the position of hiring or working with students in obtaining positions participated in this project. The student's attitudes and opinions about the project were measured through surveys. The surveys asked questions about the skills used in the project, with regard to each component of Keller's ARCS Model of Motivational Design: 1) attention, 2) relevance, 3) confidence, and 4) satisfaction. The students also had a checklist to use in order to gain measurable data for the creation of their videos for their portfolios. Participants commented that the module was helpful and some noted that they were excited to create additional videos to add to their portfolio in the future. The instructor's perceptions of using the module and the addition of videos to a student's portfolio were also measured. This resulted in very positive feedback and a request suggestion that to use the module for future classes. The evaluation of the portfolios by hiring personnel was added to the plan after the project had been designed and implemented. These evaluations were also positive about the use of videos in portfolios. The results revealed that the Web-based Video and Electronic Career Portfolios instructional module was effective in teaching students how to add video to their Electronic portfolios. The primary purpose of this project was achieved.

The author suggests that end-of-course assessments of ESL students should include a measure of growth, gain, or value-added, as well as measures of students' mastery of the English standards or English course criteria. Research has indicated that students' rate of attainment of English is not independent of their first language, and therefore students from some language backgrounds may require more time to achieve English language proficiency than students from other language backgrounds. Measures of growth, gain, or value-added provide a means to show progress toward attainment of the standards or criteria. The author suggests that if ESL students performing below grade level are not provided with some indicators of progress, they may become discouraged and drop out of school. The author provides a brief discussion of issues related to testing and assessment of ESL students, requirements of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), and adequate yearly progress (YAP).

Historically students of Environmental Science have been beleaguered by the overwhelming statistics of human failings and environmental destruction. However students need an opportunity for true hope. Biomimicry begins by inspiring admiration for the remarkable adaptations that organisms historically deemed \"lower\" or \"primitive\" employ, and facilitates the humility to recognize there is much to learn from them. In addition biomimicry provides scientific solutions that can be partnered with economic, environmental, and even spiritual growth.

        "description":"The purpose of this grant funded investigation was to examine the impact of friendship alliance in an early adolescent population on cigarette and alcohol variables. Sixth, seventh and eighth grade students from two urban areas completed a survey that addressed cigarette and alcohol attitudes, practices, expectancies and intentions. Only those students who had active written consent from parents or guardians participated in the investigation. The sample consisted of 847 sixth graders, 857 seventh graders, and 493 eighth graders. Each early adolescent reported the gender of their best friend and best friend alliances were grouped into boy-boy, girl-girl, or boy-girl best friends. Results indicated most early adolescents were engaged in same-sex best friendships but that there were a small group of cross-sex best friends. There was also a small group of individuals who changed the gender of their best friends over the three years of the study. The number of cross-sex best friends increased slightly from 7.7% in sixth grade to 10.8% in eighth grade. A cross-sex best friend alliance during early adolescence was significantly related to holding more positive expectancies toward both cigarettes and alcohol, having a non-smoker accept a cigarette from a best friend in sixth grade, and having a non-drinker accept an alcoholic drink from a best friend in seventh and eighth grades. For all early adolescents, the perception that their best friend smoked was significantly related to their own positive attitude toward cigarettes and the likelihood that they smoked. Findings from this report have shown the usefulness of breaking the peer influence variable of best friendship into three different friendship alliances. By analyzing the friendship alliances individually, factors associated with peer influence on cigarette and alcohol expectancies, intentions and use can be identified in order to make substance use prevention programs more meaningful.

This study focuses on the types of behaviors and and social play initiated by general education students in an integrated preschool setting. The setting for this study is a inclusive classroom where the day is divided between inclusion and independent class time. An analysis of data collected through observations in a preschool classroom indicated that those behaviors initiated by general education students were typically cooperative in nature with a higher frequency of modeling behavior occurring during those interactions initiated by a general education student towards a classmate with special needs.

        "description":"This project examines the impact of standards-based and curriculum reforms on the role of materials in educational systems in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Australia. The project focused on identifying activities undertaken by publishing companies and in educational systems to develop, select and use materials in the context of standards-based and curriculum reforms by investigating: (1) research literature about the publishing industry, the policies controlling the adoption of materials, and the patterns influencing the use of materials in schools in the United States; (2) the perceptions of educational publishers  about the impact of these reforms on the new materials developed by their companies to meet the needs of schools in implementing these reforms; (3) the impact of national curriculum reforms in the United Kingdom on the materials' marketplace; (4) the impact of the national standards movement in the United States on the materials' marketplace; (5) the impact of state standards in the United States on various aspects relating to materials  designed to support these reforms; (6) the impact of national curriculum collaboration in Australia on the materials' marketplace; and (7) the impact of state and territory curricula in Australia on various aspects relating to materials designed to support these reforms. The report concludes by applying categories defined in a typology to classify various activities  relating to the development, selection and use of materials identified in educational publishing and educational systems in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. Samples and questionnaires relating to surveys and a bibliography are appended. The following are appended: (1) Sample of British Publishers of Materials; (2) Survey of Publishers of Curriculum Materials in the United Kingdom; (3) Sample of American Publishers of Materials; (4) Survey of Publishers of Instructional Materials in the United States; (5) Sample of Australian Publishers of Materials; and (6) Survey of Publishers of Curriculum Materials used in Australia.

        "description":"The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the holistic approach, as compared to the segregated-skill approach, on the quantity and quality of EFL students' academic writing. The subjects for the study were 64 graduates enrolled in the Special Diploma in Education at the School of Education in Suez during the second semester of the 2001/2002 academic year. These subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups: an experimental group and a control group. At the beginning of the experiment, the two groups were pretested on academic essay writing. Following pretesting, students in both groups were taught by the researcher, at the rate of one session per week. In the experimental group, students were randomly assigned to groups of four. In each session, each group member read a research paper or an article of interest to him/her in the area of curricula and instruction and then discussed what he/she read with other members of the group. S/he then wrote a summary or an abstract of what he/she read in his/her own words and read it loudly to other members of the group. In the control group, students were taught the academic writing subskills using the direct instruction approach. The study lasted for twelve weeks, one session per week. At the end of this period, all subjects were posttested on academic essay writing. After that, the quantity and quality of each essay were scored independently from each other. The obtained data were analyzed using the t-test. The results showed no significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups on the pretest. The posttest results revealed that students in the experimental group scored significantly higher than those in the control group on the quantity of writing,, but lower on the quality of writing. This suggests that a combination of both the holistic approach and the segregated-skill approach can boost students' writing above the levels that occur with either alone. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"The belief that university faculty own the curriculum is held widely throughout American institutions of higher education, both public and private. The 1990s saw the first significant challenge to that belief. Using the Marxist and Foucualtian understanding of power and using a paradigm for understanding the functions of faculty senates in the context of larger university governance structures, this paper examines the curricular debates and their implications at Texas A &amp; M (TAMU), the State University of New York (SUNY) system, and George Mason University (GMU). Lying behind the struggle for power and understanding was a significant paradigm shift from positivistic modernism to postmodernism. What on the surface seems like a loss of power for the traditional understanding of faculty senates with respect to curriculum development and changes becomes a new paradigm for power. Shared governance, a term widely used in higher education administration, no longer seems to represent the shifting power relationships between faculty senates and administrative bodies. New ground rules must be established for a better working relationship.",

A total of 8,661 participants from the 47 original investigations provided 386 individual effect sizes for this meta-analysis. The mean effect size was r = 0.258. This suggested that the learning-style elements had a medium effect on the 30 independent variables explored. The largest effects were on Discipline (r = 0.363), Achievement (r = 0.351), Decision-Making Groups (r = 0.343), Age (r = 0.326), Ethnicity (r = 0.311), Right Brain/Left Brain (r = 0.303), and Gender (r = 0.288). Six of the 15 independent variables were discovered to have moderated the results. These included the assignment to research sample, demographic region, publication type, school level, type of statistics utilized to calculate effect size, and university. Publication bias was not revealed through correlations of sample sizes and effect sizes. Calculation of a Fail Safe N statistic determined between 1,439 and 1,644 studies supporting the null hypothesis would be necessary to reverse the conclusion that individual's preferred learning-styles were significantly related to the categorical variables examined.

Interviews with students and field notes from the class were used for data triangulation. Participants' definitions of scientific literacy were determined with document analysis and open coding of data. Then, assertions to explain findings were formed. The assertions displayed that participants define scientific literacy in relation with thinking and inquiry. However; they are having problems to define the term scientific.  Documents displayed that although participants had some traditional understandings about science, they hold more contemporary views about scientific literacy.",

Leadership development involves close examination of personal biases, understanding of the larger picture of poverty and diversity, and the development and commitment to a plan to make a difference in the lives of those in poverty or come from diverse backgrounds. The purpose of the study was to further understanding of the nature of change agentry through a comparison of developing change agent graduate students against practicing school leaders with proven records as change agents in high poverty schools. The study analyzed social change agent plans of graduate students in four programs (educational administration, human service administration, school and agency counseling) with the work of four practicing school principals identified as social change agents working in high poverty schools. The study used a framework developed from a previous study of graduate student their social change agent plans. The framework included moral purpose, application social and professional toolkit theory to practice (which encompassed professional competencies, definition of necessary changes in profession influencing others to action, listening, tolerance for ambiguity and risk), and empathy for others. Conclusions drawn from the study confirm the original framework of moral purpose, social and professional toolkits, and empathy for others. The empathy expressed by practicing principals was not as explicit as with graduate students writing about future intentions to make a difference in the lives of others. As might be expected, the professional toolkits of these principals was more fully developed particularly in regards to collaboration with teachers and others to achieve their mission to raise student achievement. The application of professional knowledge, skills, and understandings to raise student achievement involves complex behaviors that cannot be taught. The importance of providing graduate students models of effective change agents is deemed essential. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Merely experience in receiving and sending nonverbal cues, however, is not sufficient to improve nonverbal skill. Consequently, a training program was designed to develop nonverbal sensitivity of school administrators and pre-service teachers and to help them to effectively express themselves nonverbally. Two experimental investigations with school-principals and university students were to test the effectiveness of the program and to investigate psychosocial correlates of nonverbal skill. Results revealed significant improvements in nonverbal perceptiveness, expressiveness, and extraversion. Statistically significant age- and gender related differences and relationships between measures of decoding and encoding ability and psychosocial correlates were found.

Through the research, parents of primary school V. grade students were chosen for sampling. Data have been collected with &quot;the scale of instructional communicative qualification of parents&quot; that its reliability and validity study have done and developed by the researcher. According to this, there are 34 items at the instructional communicative qualification of parents with students. Descriptive statistics, t-test and one-way-ANOVA are used through the data analyses. Through the research communicative qualification of parents with students was compared with the nominal variables (age, education and profession). It was found out that parents find themselves sufficient through the communication with students (with their children). (Contains 6 tables.)",

The research generated information to create a computer program to assist undergraduates with the construction of their professional teaching portfolios.  As students used the computer program, portfolios were being constructed in many electronic formats. The identification of one accessible electronic system became necessary for student and program evaluation and for accreditation purposes. As a result, a development and a professional portfolio were created within a digital system. The system includes rubrics which connect the standards and the aggregation of data.

Interviews were conducted with 10 European-American and 16 Asian-American families. Asian-American families (94%) were more likely to report parent-child co-sleeping arrangements than were European-American families (10%). Results indicated that children from families that practiced parent-child co-sleeping had significantly fewer occurrences of nighttime fear.

The Wellness program consisted of one semester of physical education and one semester of classroom instruction in lifetime wellness, a course formerly known as Health/PE. The second purpose was to encourage collaboration between students, parents, Wellness teachers, school administration, community health care partners, and cafeteria staff, all of whom directly or indirectly influence student attitudes and behaviors about healthy foods and healthy eating habits. Third and perhaps most importantly, students who completed the health behavior survey would be able to reflect on their responses over the course of the school year. During the project, students would be provided information that would enable them to make decisions about their nutrition and eating habits that could potentially affect their health throughout their adult lives. A random sample of 125 students were surveyed as a component of a Nutrition Education Training (N.E.T.) project. Students representing the population of five area high schools were surveyed in fall and spring of the freshman year of school.

Recent research has shed light on the many different aspects of our lives affected by trauma but we still struggle with effective assessment, conceptualization, and treatment. This article presents a holistic process of assessment and approach to treatment that better helps counselors conceptualize the areas of difficulty for clients who have experienced a traumatic event. This holistic and individualistic approach to trauma assessment and treatment provides a new way to look at survivors of traumatic events.

The findings indicated that 84 percent of the teachers felt either well or very well prepared to integrate technology into curriculum, and that they were able to overcome the typical barriers to computer use in elementary classrooms. The teachers overwhelmingly indicated that computers have considerable potential for allowing students to discover or construct ideas for themselves and supported constructivist pedagogies when referring to computer use in elementary classrooms.

How important are locus of control issues in moral development? and Why might process versus product elements be crucial in the development of values? One key element missing in the values literature is a model that integrates major theoretical viewpoints and has the potential to guide teachers, parents, and others who work with children and adolescents. This paper will offer a synthesis of the theories offered by Sigmund Freud (personality elements of the id, ego, and superego), Erik Erikson (identity formation), Lawrence Kohlberg (moral development), and Carol Gilligan (female versus male moral development) in order to explain how values are acquired and maintained, moral decisions are made, and mental health is established and perpetuated. This two stage model will highlight how the socialization process initially claims a powerful influence upon children, and then around adolescence an entirely new cognitive developmental moral decision-making process is theoretically available to be used to sustain the individual throughout adulthood. It is crucial to understand that this new state is not inevitable or guaranteed in any way, since many adults continue to function upon values established during childhood with little or no reflection upon or modification of these values.",

        "description":"Are creativity and imaginative thinking impeded by the emphasis that many American schools place on cooperative learning and collaborative thinking today? This paper explores past and present philosophies concerning individualism and creativity as they relate to education in the USA. A person's ability to individuate is based on the premise that freedom of personal choice and opportunity are essential to the development of self-reason, self-interests, and self-esteem. Curriculum and instructional programming that emphasize cooperative group learning and collaboration at the expense of individual ideation may undermine and erode individualism and the imaginative spirit. Might this also suggest that a de-emphasis on individual creation, imagination, and production weakens intrinsic motivation and problem-solving and decision-making, and impedes personal freedom to be creative?",

The discussion, which is presented within the context of a socio-cultural perspective on bias in perceptions of error, is intended to invite teachers to be more tolerant of diversity as they guide students to use &quot;Standard American English.&quot; Errors illustrating the discussion have been adapted from the writing and oral speech of students from southern Appalachia and are analyzed within the context of linguistic roots and language evolution. Linguistic analysis of errors includes the common &quot;had went&quot; contrasted with a more archaic yet &quot;correct&quot; usage, as well as nonstandard verbs and participles. Related attention is given to how oral pronunciation can invite biased perceptions of error. The presentation concludes with advice on how to be sensitive to diversity issues in the classroom.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study had two objectives, first to determine the number of new teachers that had left the teaching profession in a five year period (2000-2005), and to learn about mentors teachers' perspectives regarding the mentor training and the program as a whole.  Methodology: A questionnaire was administered to some mentor teachers, and two interviews were held with a small group of mentors to learn about their experiences. District programmers extracted historical files to set up 5 cohorts of new teachers, one per year. Those teachers were tracked for five years to determine if they had left the district. Results: Teachers in EPISD leave the profession of teaching at slower rates than teachers in the rest of the country. EPISD data show that of teachers who started their profession four (2001) and five (2000) years ago, 73 and 76 percent respectively, are still teaching in EPISD.   The majority of the mentors (87%) felt the training had been effective in preparing them to become highly qualified mentors; furthermore, mentors felt the quality of the mentor training was &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Good&quot;. Overall mentor teachers seem to be satisfied with the mentor training. The study also pointed out that EPISD does not have a sound system in place to collect information from teachers as they leave the District; when teachers leave, the reason for leaving is unknown to the District. Conclusion: Even though mentors seemed to be pleased with the mentor training, some mentor teachers seem to be concerned about not having time to meet with their mentee, or not knowing how to schedule meeting and observation times. Strong campus and district support is needed. Recommendation:  District officials need to institutionalize the MENTOR Program by creating a full time position to oversee the overall implementation and monitoring of the program. Further study is recommended to identify and determine what has influenced new teachers to stay district officials to identify district us initiatives, as well as principals' behaviors and practices that have had a positive impact in new teachers. It is key to set up a process through the Human Resources Department where teachers who are leaving the district would have to complete a short survey with questions such as: reason for leaving, reasons for moving, future plans, and teacher opinion on school climate and job perceptions.

        "description":"The main goal of the study was to document and describe the beginnings of the implementation of the Strategic Instructional Model at five (5) middle schools in the EPISD.  The study also examined Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) data from those students that participated in the program. Methodology: Implementation information was collected through questionnaires completed by teachers, trainers and the program coordinator of the Strategic Instructional Model. TAKS data in the areas of Reading and Writing were extracted and analyzed as well. Results: Information gathered through interviews with appropriate program staff and teachers indicates that the training of teachers in SAS strategies and routines has been founded upon sound research, was well planned, and consistently delivered to participating teachers. However, the subsequent expected uniform and consistent implementation of these strategies and techniques has been, at best, haphazard. This has been the case particularly on campuses where the site administrator does not support the program philosophy, and where teachers do not receive the desired support to implement the learned strategies. On the other hand, the Strategic Instructional Model (SIM) has been implemented in the District since 1993 without a program that includes specific goals, activities, and formative and summative evaluation efforts. The SIM curriculum started as a central office initiative to address the non-compliance issues with respect to the least restrictive environment (LRE). The SAS Program Assistant developed an implementation plan in 2003-04 to assist those school administrators who wished to implement SAS strategies, using the Strategic Instructional Mode (SIM). Conclusions:   Most teachers who use these strategies and routines do report their effectiveness and impact on student achievement. There are close to 500 teachers in the District who are knowledgeable about the SIM Curriculum. Recommendations: It was recommended that the Staff Development Office, and Curriculum and Instruction staffs, in close collaboration with the appropriate site administrators need to delineate a program plan that includes the school selection criteria, rationale for implementation, clear defined objectives, defined teaching practices and stated outcomes It is also important to point out that a great percentage of the students that received strategy instruction passed the reading and writing state tests. It is unknown to which other programs or treatments these students were exposed, thus making it very difficult to determine causality. This outcome also supports the argument for continued study with more consistent and supported use of the Strategic Instructional Model.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a critical analysis of (1) the disparities between the SAT scores of Black and White students, and Hispanic and White students, for 2004 and 2005 and (2) what those disparities suggest about the effectiveness of the State of Virginia &quot;SOL&quot; program and the Federal &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; (NCLB) program. The nationwide averages of Black and White students on the 2004 and 2005 overall, verbal, and math SAT were compared. Conclusions were drawn about the effectiveness of the &quot;NCLB&quot; program, based on the results of those comparisons. Comparisons were also done between Black and White students, in the State of Virginia, using their statewide overall, verbal, and math averages on the SAT, for 2004 and 2005.  Based on those comparisons, conclusions were drawn concerning the effectiveness of the State of Virginia &quot;SOLs&quot;. The same kinds of comparisons were done between Hispanic and White students and similar conclusions were made. The sizes of the gaps between Blacks and Whites, and Hispanics and Whites, were examined, along with their implications for what Black and Hispanic students, and colleges and universities, must do to accomplish the task of closing them. Results indicate that, based on  overall, verbal, and math SAT scores, on a national level, the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; program has not helped Black students to catch up with their White counterparts, but, on the contrary, it has succeeded, for the most part, in leaving them further behind. The same was found to be the case for comparisons between Hispanic and White students. Comparisons of SAT scores of Black and White students and Hispanic and White students, at the statewide level revealed similar results, i.e., the State of Virginia &quot;SOLs&quot; did not decrease the gaps. If Black and Hispanic students are to be competitive (in the job market) when they finish college, the gap must be closed between the day that they enter college and the day that they graduate. Perhaps, instead focusing on helping the students that are behind to reach low or minimum standards, the State of Virginia &quot;SOL&quot; program and the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; program should focus on helping them to reach the highest level of education that they are capable of achieving. Future studies should focus on comparisons with other subgroups, i.e., females, Black males, students from low income families, etc. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)",

If the measurement error of the pretest-score mean of the treatment group is ignored, this method will generate a unique matched sample once the criteria for attempting to create two similar groups are determined. Otherwise, multiple sets of similar matched samples can be generated and the performance of the treatment group can be compared with each of the multiple matched samples using an appropriate statistical analysis. Afterwards, the mean of the effect size measure, taking the average of the effect size across replicated comparisons, can then be used to assess the efficacy of any program. This enhances our confidence level to decide whether a program is effective or not, compared to the finding resulting from a single comparison. A description of &quot;Zero-One Linear Programming&quot; and its application to create a matched sample or multiple sets of  matched samples is introduced in this paper.

Researchers used Zero-One Linear Programming to draw multiple sets of matched samples from the non-magnet student population to serve as multiple control groups for the research effort. Whenever a matched sample was generated, the analysis of covariance was subsequently used to control for the effects of the possible pretest score difference between the two groups on the outcome variable (posttest score on reading or mathematics). The mean of the effect size values, across 200 matched-sample analyses, was used to investigate the effects of the magnet program treatment on the reading and mathematics performance of magnet students. The results for the elementary school magnet programs showed that when students' demographics and initial abilities were accounted for, only the French immersion program had a likely positive impact on students' reading or mathematics performance. Nevertheless, the rest of the magnet programs had minimal, if any, positive effect to promote higher reading and mathematics test scores of magnet students.

The article will rely on a review the literature regarding constitutional interpretive philosophy and church-state related issues as well as analyses of historical documents and Supreme Court opinions. It is the position of this article that original intent possesses its own brand of subjectivity, thus making it no more superior than other interpretive methods in that regard. Original intent furthermore is likely to have an effect that favors conservatives who wish to return religion back to the public schools. Educational leaders, regardless of their political affiliation, are called upon to be engaged in political activism, especially in the election or nomination process of Justices.",

The low achievement of aboriginal students lies in factors related to problems in finance, health, and cultural difference, which contribute to their sense of self-deprecation. The purpose of the project is to provide early intervention and prevention services to 50 aboriginal students in grades 10 to 12, who are at risk for school failure, financial difficulties, Hepatitis Type B, sanitary problems, and alcohol-related incidents. The services will be provided through the collaborative teamwork of school faculty, parent volunteers, and peers, and will be offered during lunch breaks and instructional activities. Through the efforts of collaborative teamwork, the strategies within the 1-year plan are designed to reconstruct the aboriginal students' self-esteem and self-confidence in positive and healthy learning environments. Accordingly, the aboriginal students are able to achieve the expected behavioral modification and enhance their motivation for academic success, as the basis of pursuing higher-level education. Expected outcomes in the project are improved academics, better school attendance rates and the refinement of knowledge and skills about health protection to improve health conditions.

Methodology: Data was collected using 127 questionnaires and 20 interviews applied to a group of elementary schools teachers working at the public system in the city of Rio de Janeiro while attending an undergraduate Education course at a public University. It is also important to mention that the constructivist approach is dominant in this course and in the curriculum of the public schools where these teachers teach. Results: The schoolteachers investigated were all female and had the following characteristics: 73% were born in the city of Rio de Janeiro, 7% at the rural area of the State, and 20% outside the State of Rio de Janeiro. Data about the family background of these teachers, including their husband's professions showed they come from families with very little formal education. Concerning their teaching practice, 68% of the teachers have a 1-to-10-year range in experience. Most teachers who were investigated in this research, regarded the idea of organizing pedagogical work according to the heterogeneity of the group as positive in relation to the students' interaction in the classroom, but they remarked that they had difficulty in incorporating this into their pedagogical work, since the school planning aiming at directing the pedagogical work to more homogeneous patterns was regarded as the easiest to implement and to achieve their goals. Conclusions &amp; Recommendations: Our analysis indicated three aspects to be developed based on our research findings: to emphasize the political aspect of education; to establish new forms of partnership with schools critical teachers developing successful practices; and to put into practice, during the University courses, new ways of dealing with diversity.

In this study, sixty-three first-grade children were randomly selected from four first grade classes from two primary schools in a university town in a nonnative English-speaking country during the second term of the academic year. The group was randomly placed in groups of 21. The first two served as the experimental groups (identity, and blending/manipulation) and the third group served as the language experience (control). Both the identity and blending/manipulation groups were instructed using different instructional modalities. The third group was not exposed to any direct instruction. The results of the study indicate that after the eight weeks of instruction, the children in the identity group made modest gains in posttest scores over those in the blending/manipulation group on two of the measures--the test of phoneme cue reading (TPCR) and the test of vocabulary (PPVT). While the identity group made statistically significant gains over the blending/manipulation group, it was observed that the implicit associations between orthography and phonology that the subjects made that may have aided them to gradually construct an orthographic-phonologic to decode words. Educators of limited English proficiency learners need to adopt instructional modalities that allow for the interplay of models which can have more noticeable effects on the reading programs in the early elementary years.

Using a structured survey which included Q-Sort and Likert Scale methodologies followed by in-depth interviews, the study's findings provided insights into adult student motivations to complete a baccalaureate degree and their expectations for that degree in relation to their careers and personal growth. The study indicated that the students were motivated to learn mainly by self-improvement (27.0 % ranked it as the primary motivator) and sense of achievement (rated first by 20.6% of the students). Analysis of the data uncovered mixed information on how employer reimbursement of education costs affected the students' motivation, that no one influenced the students to attend school, and that the students chose this university for its reputation. To provide a quality education, the university should ensure that faculty have training in teaching adults learners. It also should continue to hire instructors currently employed or with past world experience in the field they are teaching in order to bring real-world experience to the classroom.

The study first focused on three questions: what research is being conducted on defining best practice related to the use of the Internet, what is the impact of various types of Internet use on K-12 student learning, and what is the impact of various types of Internet use on powerful social studies teaching and learning? The answers to these questions then served as a starting point for describing a set of holistic guidelines for Internet use in social studies classrooms. The literature review on the use of the Internet, both for general classroom teaching and in the social studies classroom, found that, while much is said about the potential of the Internet and various examples described in which it can be utilized, little research has been conducted on its impact on student learning and on the in-service use of the Internet use in social studies classrooms. The study also indicated that many teachers do not use the Internet on a regular basis and, for those teachers who do use the Internet, it is employed without changing their traditional approach to teaching. The recommendation from this study was to utilize the NCSS Position Statement on Powerful Teaching and Learning in the Social Studies as a guide to assist in developing a more structured and intentional use of this medium. To this end an inventory of Internet use based on the tenets of Powerful Teaching and Learning was provided along with examples on how each domain of the inventory could be used in the social studies classroom.",

        "author":["Holland, Rochelle"],
        "description":"The purpose of this case survey was to examine the reasons that students provide regarding why they are on academic probation and the efficacy of discussing the family life cycle among this group. Initially, a pilot population of 93 students on academic probation, who are a part of a multi-cultural community college in New York City, were surveyed during the spring 2005 semester. The pilot survey found that most of the students reported to be on academic probation because of having social problems. The pilot survey satisfied reliability and validity. During the fall 2005 semester, a revised survey was administered to 16 students on academic probation. Six were African American, two were Asian, six were Hispanic, one was West Indian, and one was Hispanic and African-American. These students attended an academic success workshop that was geared to assist them with meeting retention standards. Category variables such as: parental status, caregiver status, personal illness, family illness, employment, poor academic preparation, and mental health status, were used to probe responses. The survey was administered before the workshop, so their responses would not be influenced by the workshop materials. During the workshop, the researcher discussed ways of getting off probation, presented concepts of the family life cycle, and explored how to manage multi-tasking responsibilities for family-life, school, work, and personal needs. After the workshop, students were given a Likert scale to evaluate the workshop. The results of the survey reported that students were on academic probation because of ambiguity with managing multi-tasking role responsibilities in the areas of family life and social life. Fifteen students reported mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, stress, and attention deficit disorder as impeding factors. The students found the workshop and the discussion of the family life cycle to be very beneficial. College students on academic probation should be educated on the family life cycle, healthy relationships, and how to manage multi-tasked responsibilities. This will help them venture into the first phase of self-efficacy. General systems theory argues that the sum of parts equals a whole. Thus, family life, employment responsibilities, job satisfaction, healthy partner relationships, and educational attainment will be the sum of parts that equals the individual, and in the realm of academia understanding these variables are vital for servicing the contemporary college student. Further research is needed for discussing the family life cycle among college students on academic probation.",

        "description":"A new standard setting method, Mapmark, was recently developed by ACT Inc. in the course of a contract with the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) to set achievement levels for the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in Grade 12 mathematics. Mapmark includes elements of the bookmark method (Lewis, Mitzel, & Green, 1996; Mitzel, Lewis, Patz, & Green, 2001), item maps (Masters, Adams, & Loken, 1994), and expected percent correct scores on clusters of assessment items representing areas of knowledge, skills, and abilities called \"domains\" (Schulz, Lee, & Mullen, 2005). The present paper provides a detailed description of the Mapmark method, as implemented in the Achievement Level Setting (ALS) meeting conducted for NAGB, and presents results bearing on the procedural validity of the method. Procedural validity is assessed through panelists' responses to process evaluation questionnaires and by other data collected in the meeting.  It is concluded that the Mapmark process exhibits evidence of procedural validity. (Contains 13 tables and 15 figures.)",

        "description":"The main purpose of this study was to gather evidence regarding the existence of a Culturally Relevant and Responsive Educational program (CRRE) in schools and especially classrooms. The CRRE conceptual framework presents a comprehensive model dealing with all aspect of instruction and education (Maddahian, and Bird, 2004). To examine the prevalence of an instructional program based on a CRRE framework a random sample of 40 schools was selected for observation and data collection. The sample included 16 elementary schools 12 middle schools and 3 high schools. A team of fifteen trained data collectors observed teachers and classrooms, documenting evidence of culturally relevant and responsive instruction through detailed field notes and direct classroom observation. In relation to the inclusion of student's prior knowledge and experience, and use alternative learning styles and modalities, we found evidence related to this domain in that less than half of the classroom observations. Overall, there was little evidence of mutual respect, acceptance of cultural diversity, and expression of high expectations for all students.  With regard to the provision and utilization of culturally relevant materials and artifacts representing all children in the classroom, materials and decor reflecting student diversity were documented in less than one-fourth of the observations in elementary and rarely in secondary classrooms. The extent to which classroom instruction exhibited the use of clear standards, teaching multicultural content, and paying attention to diversity and poverty issues was very low.  There was almost no evidence of multicultural content especially in secondary mathematics classes. Close to half the observations observers demonstrated evidence of cooperative learning, active learning, instructional conversations, and scaffolding.  The quality of these efforts and degree to which they were successful could not be assessed in this. In about ten percent of the elementary school observations there was evidence of using alternative assessment methods, compared to the half of elementary observation using traditional testing strategies.  We observed use of alternative and authentic assessment approaches in less than one-fifth of secondary classroom observations. Finally, there was no parental presence in the classroom other than when teachers called them regarding discipline issues or to discuss the lack or low level of their children' progress. Community presence was rare, with few instances of community presentations and involvement. (Contains 7 tables.)",

The sample consisted of 722 elementary, middle, and high school teachers. The results indicate that most teachers reported using the results to make instructional and assessment changes, especially those who emphasized depth of learning and higher-level cognition. Greater collaboration among teachers was reported, as well as more formative classroom assessment. Elementary teachers changed more than secondary teachers. Small to moderate effect sizes suggest important impacts on a moderate number of teachers that are more positive than previously reported for high-stakes minimum competency testing.

The question in the study is \"What components in program that integrate technology throughout the program are related to the development of preservice teachers' TPCK?\" Technology coursework, micro teaching, work sample are combined to help preservice teachers develop their TPCK. Journal, questionnaires, and observations from eight mathematics preservice teachers participated in the study reported that coursework was valued as main source of knowledge of technology, content, and pedagogy followed by the work sample, and micro teaching. Cooperating teacher was considered as important source of knowledge of pedagogy and content. While faculty was considered as main source of technology, university supervisor was as source of knowledge of pedagogy. The implication for future research would be preparing a better course work that consider the need of knowledge and skills of technology integration in mathematics classroom since the course work is the most influential factor that help preservice teachers to develop their TPCK.

In terms of language classroom settings, integrating computers into teaching and learning brings certain communication patterns and, at the same time, poses the question about adaptation of classroom communicative practices. In order to understand a ubiquitous influence of technology in the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), it is important to examine what actually happens in classrooms with and without computers and how the teacher and the students use languages in different contexts. This study proposes a research design that includes micro and macro perspectives by combining two kinds of theoretical framework: IRE (initiation, response and evaluation) framework and a systemic functional framework. A step-by-step procedure is described using a case study that examined the uses of computers as well as classroom discourse structure in an English as a foreign language (EFL) class.

During fall semester 2004, 30 undergraduate students developed learning plans in the undergraduate course, \"Training Systems in Business and Industry\". Results suggest that learning plans facilitate learning by focusing students on the goals of the course. At the end of the semester, students evaluated the use of learning plans.

The results of this study were as follows; First, board games functioned as play-oriented activities in Korea. But in America board games functioned as learning-oriented activities rather than as play-oriented ones in that classroom. Second, there were some differences in children's board game commencement behavior, observation behavior of board game rules, winning strategies, and behavior at game termination, and board game behavior by demographic characteristics but there were common features also found between two countries.",

But, even though these historically basic channels of communication are used less, the patterns of their usage are still ingrained in us from years of evolutionary development. The new communication technologies and resulting new channels of communication pose a challenge because of their constant change, redefinition and varied application. The posted outlook for the future is that we will continue to evolve with the new communication technologies but still be grounded in more historic basic channels of communication due to thousands of years of emphasis.",

To facilitate the assessment of this goal, reliable and valid scores on self-concept scales are required for the proper interpretation of related substantive issues. The main purpose of this study is to examine the construct validity of scores on a self-concept scale used with Taiwanese elementary students. Participants consisted of 1612 students from grades 3 to 6 in Taiwanese elementary schools. The School Self-Concept Measure used in this study was a paper-and-pencil self-reported questionnaire. This measure contained 15 items and used a 4-point Likert-scale format where high scores indicated positive self-concept of students. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with maximum likelihood (ML) estimating method was conducted to analyze the school self-concept scale. Three-factor oblique model was a hypothesized factor model. There were three objectives: (1) Does the correlated three-factor structure of self-concept scale fit the data collected in this study? (2) Is correlated three-factor structure of self-concept scale better than alternative factor models? (3) Is correlated three-factor structure of self-concept scale invariant across gender groups and grade groups? Results showed that he three-factor oblique model fit the data sampled in this study. So the hypothesis of multidimensionality of self-concept was verified. The results of this investigation also strongly confirmed the invariance of factor loadings, factor variances/covariances, and error variances across gender and grade groups.

        "description":"Fleiss' popular multirater kappa is known to be influenced by prevalence and bias, which can lead to the paradox of high agreement but low kappa. It also assumes that raters are restricted in how they can distribute cases across categories, which is not a typical feature of many agreement studies. In this article, a free-marginal, multirater alternative to Fleiss' multirater kappa is introduced. Free-marginal Multirater Kappa (multirater K[free]), like its birater free-marginal counterparts (PABAK, S, RE, and K[m],) is not influenced by kappa and is appropriate for the typical agreement study, in which raters' distributions of cases into categories are not restricted. Recommendations for the proper use of multirater K[free] are included. (Contains 5 equations, 3 tables, and 3 figures.)",

From three leading distance education journals, a sample of 66 articles was categorized by study type and the experimental or quasi-experimental articles were analyzed in terms of their research methodologies.

One hundred thirty teachers of all grade levels of the school district were sampled with a Likert survey of 45 items. Subscales of the survey include stressor associated with administration, stressors associated with students, job satisfaction, professional self-esteem, and demographic information about the participants. Results indicated that overall respondents were very positive about being teachers; given the opportunity, almost 79% would choose teaching again as a career.  Negatives included anxieties about student violence as expressed by a majority of teachers on three of the 45 items, and that the teachers believed that teaching is not respected by those outside the profession. The researchers concluded that overall the teachers in the district had very positive attitudes about teaching. Recommendations included (1) that the administration as teachers what works with students instead of asking textbook companies and administration (2) encouraging teaching input into curricular decisions (3) holding students and parents accountable for student achievement (4) making professional development opportunities more relevant.

Student samples were conducted of both special education and general education students. Teacher interviews and observations were also used in this process. This research was conducted in an elementary school with approximately 500 students, 10% of the population being special education students. The results showed that students can benefit and improve their reading with the direct instruction of phonological awareness. Teachers need to understand the importance of this piece and be sure to integrate it into their curriculum. Without this instruction, some students do not make the connection to the letter-sound correspondence, therefore, leading to difficulty in the areas of reading and writing. It is recommended that teachers in grades kindergarten through second grade spend about 20 minutes per day teaching this concept.

Several findings emerged as important factors in creating and sustaining community college-university transfer partnerships, including the importance of previous relationships between institutions, the significance of presidential support for partnership practices, the need for adequate and sustained funding, and the importance of maintaining a university presence on community college campuses. This paper concentrates on two of these findings: challenges in partnership management and governance, and the importance of involving faculty in partnership programs and activities.

The study used the NAEP National Public School data. The statistically significant (p is less than 0.01 with effect size measured by Cohen's &quot;d&quot;) differences in reading scores by gender were consistent across grade level and years with females scoring higher than males. Although all differences were statistically significantly, perhaps as a function of the very large sample sizes, the effect size of the differences ranged from low to moderate. Effect sizes increased as grade-level increased indicating a greater gender gap in reading as students progressed through school. A discussion of the calculation and reporting of effect size with NAEP data is included as well as implications for the No Child Left Behind goals of &quot;closing the gap.&quot; This paper presents the argument that the &quot;child left behind&quot; in reading is very likely to be male--from elementary school through university.",

Twenty-nine senior leaders--school superintendents and assistant superintendents--from across New England were randomly surveyed and asked to identify qualities of inspired schools and, to the extent possible, to offer examples for closer examination. Eight schools representing different demographics, levels and district sizes were selected from an equal number of independent public school districts for inclusion in this study. Through in-depth interviews eleven characteristics of inspired schools were identified: (1) attention is invested in the developmental needs of all members of the school community; (2) leadership is embraced at all levels; (3) a relational approach to education is supported; (4) an assets-based approach to student learning is encouraged; (5) traditions that nurture a sense of belonging are deemed important; (6) a unique &quot;sense of place&quot; and mission is common; (7) reliance on an &quot;inner compass&quot; is essential; (8) intentionality in promoting a sense of inclusivity, equity and global citizenship is valued; (9) a high degree of stakeholdership exists; (10) a commitment to community involvement and service is present; and (11) a visible valuing of the integrated arts is fostered. Results suggest that a common set of characteristics about what constitutes an inspired school does exist.

        "description":"Kentucky's school reform accountability goal of each school reaching an academic measure of &quot;proficiency&quot; by 2014 illuminated the findings in recent statewide reading test scores:  44.30% of middle and 71.25% of high school students scored below &quot;proficient.&quot; The research question for this exploratory, descriptive study was, &quot;Do teaching practices in secondary schools with high reading achievement scores differ from those in schools with low reading achievement scores?&quot; High school reading scores were first stratified by region. Regions seven and eight--western and eastern Kentucky--were selected for the study. Next, the reading scores were sorted by score from highest to lowest within the two regions. Five secondary schools were randomly selected from each of the resulting four strata (N=20). Feeder schools for the 20 secondary schools were identified and added (N=19) for a total sample of 39 schools. 70.5% of the 8th-10th grade teachers within these schools completed surveys, developed by using research-based reading strategies. A random sample of five teachers within each school was selected to be observed then interviewed. Finally, a content analysis of each school's Comprehensive School Improvement Plan identified strategies planned to improve reading. Quantitative and qualitative data analyses were used to identify differences between instructional strategies in high and low achieving schools. (Contains 17 tables.)

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to understand what it could mean to have communication apprehension (CA). Literature that focuses on the research and theoretical aspects of communication apprehension was collected. From this research the concept of communication apprehension was conceptually defined, tools for measuring this phenomenon were outlined, and the concept was compared and contrasted to related research constructs. Next a critical interpretation was performed on several foundational pieces of communication apprehension research on international and marginalized social groups using a critical paradigm derived from the disciplines of intercultural communication, multicultural education, and critical perspectives on race and difference. The results of this critical interpretation suggest that there is the potential for misattributions of communication apprehension when working with students from marginalized US-American socio-cultural backgrounds and international populations that speak English as a second language. This critical perspective suggests that what may be perceived in some student populations as communication apprehension might actually be the result of speaking a marginalized dialect or English as a second language or coming from a different cultural background as this may require the speaker to translate their language into socially acceptable forms. Results suggest that educators and practitioners of communication apprehension diagnosis and research need to be aware of linguistic, cultural, and sociolinguistic background to ensure that correct attributions of communication apprehension are being made. Suggestions are offered for enhancing students' oral communication within speech and language classrooms in ways that are cognizant of these differences.",

The field workers also filled out a checklist that provided the data of the study, which were then input into two nonparametric tests: (a) Mann-Whitney U Test, and (b) Kruskal Wallis H Test. The results of data analysis showed that \"repetition of complaint\" was an important strategy in connection to the \"perceived situational seriousness\" of the topic of complaint. Sex was found to cause the differential use of three conversational strategies, social class to cause the differential use of two conversational strategies, and perceived situational seriousness and age each to cause that of only on conversational strategy. A cline of significance is suggested for each of the independent variables in question. Suggestions are made for further research.

The vowel harmony is a well-known concept in linguistics. One may not comprehend that in a word; every single vowel is used according to some specific rules, which are sure to influence one another, and no other vowel can be used instead of the one at its definite place without the change of the sense of the whole word. The illustrated material which is taken from the research is, of course, in no way complete. The methods used in the project study are various; from the methodological overall selection of the words and word-combinations to generalizing tables conclusions which could help to better understand the nature of the VH dependence.

Twenty-one elementary school principals were randomly selected for a week-long time-task analysis. Data collectors shadowed the principals collecting data every five minutes for one week. Surveys of parents, students and staff were conducted to determine perception of the principal's role. School Administration Managers (SAMs) were placed in pilot schools to determine if principals would increase time spent on instructional duties and, if so, would this increase the rate of student achievement gain. Principals with SAM's increased the amount of time spent on instructional leadership to 66%. (29% without SAMs) The rate of student academic achievement gain more than doubled after one year. The study indicates that the traditional administrative structure of elementary schools does not allow principals adequate time for instructional leadership, that the principal's day is fragmented and \"interrupt driven,\" that principals can increase time spent on instructional leadership and that this change in the use of time results in increased student achievement and gap closure. Policy makers should consider if the principal's job is doable as currently structured.

The colored school was part of a dynamic Black community full of economic and social vitality, yet was in a time period in which Blacks still could not attend public school with White children. This study documented the individuals and community groups--both Black and White--who participated in the establishment of this colored school, as well as to document the specific efforts and events involved in getting this school funded and opened.  This study uncovered the names and backgrounds of people involved, the communities' churches, businesses, interactions between the Black community and the City Council and Board of Education of Marysville, and the chronology and contents of meetings held to further the development of the schools. It details the chronology of the opening of the school, and documents the individual backgrounds of the African Americans who worked to get the school funded and opened. The study provides insights into a time within a fairly integrated community with bustling social and economic possibilities for the Black community, although still not providing for equal rights for all citizens.

Two quasi experiments were conducted in six 6th grade classes with a total of 108 students respectively. The students in the control groups were taught the concepts of triangles in their original classes, while the students in experimental groups were instructed in a computer lab. Experimental group students utilized Interactive Middle School Math Bundle, which is an interactive Webpage-typed tutorial. The tutorial, featuring descriptions, sound, animation and self-examination, allowed students to navigate and self-explore themselves. Independent-t was used to analyze the data. The analysis revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the students' achievement in the control and experimental groups.

        "description":"Fifty-four students (21 boys and 33 girls from four schools in Estonia) participated in the experiment. Their age was between 15 and 16. The hypothesis of the study was that boys and girls prefer different characteristics of multimedia textbooks. Six multimedia textbooks were chosen for the study: about mathematics, chemistry, geography, Estonian language and 2 textbooks about history. Six units of each textbook (except mathematic, in which we took 5 units) were used in the experiment. The study took place over a period of 8 months. All these 35 units of the multimedia textbooks were presented to the subjects. Students worked with computers independently with every unit. After learning each unit, the students were asked to evaluate on 10-point scale plainness of manipulating and fitness of assessment. At the same time, the units of multimedia textbooks were analysed from many aspects. Forty-six characteristics were about the multimedia textbook manipulation and twenty-five characteristics specified questions and responses in the unit. The values of the characteristics of each unit were found by using strictly fixed rules. The coefficients of Spearman rank correlation between the evaluations of boys and girls and the units' characteristics were calculated to find out characteristics of multimedia textbooks, which make manipulating simpler for boys and girls and assessment more suitable for both sexes. It was found out that the girls preferred more guidelines for manipulation of the program and simpler program interface. The most important differences were found in the boys' and girls' evaluations about the feedback. The hypothesis was conclusive in the experiment. The lists of preferred characteristics were different for girls and boys. To design educational software which motivates girls, the complicacy of navigation and guidelines for orientation must be carefully controlled. When designing the assessment, preferences of feedback both boys and girls should be taken into consideration. Statistically significant Spearman correlation coefficients are displayed in two tables.",

A total of 10 participants from a large mid-western state university participated in this study. All ten participants were in-service teachers enrolled in graduate classes. The findings of this study indicated that teachers had positive attitudes toward inclusion of students with disabilities in general education classroom. Some differences, however, were found between the attitudes of special and regular education teachers. Special educators were more supportive to full inclusion than the general educators.

Validity of the national board certification hinges on a fundamental concern whether confounding factors other than teaching performance have contributed to the certification outcome. In particular, gender stereotypic influence is examined in this study using a large-scale national database in four subject areas. Besides confirming gender inequity in the scoring outcomes, the results also suggest that the outcome difference was subject-specific.

The focus of this article is to communicate to teachers, based on the results of this survey with 30 teachers, that they are not alone in their feelings of frustration and vulnerability; that these feelings can change with work experience; and finally, by being aware of and communicating their feelings, the excitement, happiness and frustration that working with children can bring, teachers can provide encouragement, motivation and camaraderie to each other.",

A concise list of readiness skills to guide parents and teachers when deciding if a child is ready for kindergarten is lacking. The literature reveals that older age kindergarten entrance is not a predictor of academic success, nor is age an accurate indicator of readiness. In this study, responses from approximately 22 kindergarten teachers to a readiness questionnaire identify and develop a succinct list of the skills these professionals view as most significant for kindergarten readiness. According to the teachers in this study, the ability to sit and listen for approximately 15 minutes is a very necessary readiness skill. Additionally, respect for peers, following directions, appropriate classroom behavior, and personal responsibility were also consistently identified as indicators of kindergarten readiness. While most teachers in the sample would prefer incoming kindergarten students to have already turned five before entering school, age and academic skills were not identified as necessary for kindergarten readiness in this study.

        "description":"In the current school climate of standards-based curriculum and the emphasis on measuring student achievement by state-mandated standardized testing, teachers have to carefully allocate instructional time with emphasis on reading and mathematics. The assumption often is that these subjects need to be taught in the morning when students are more alert. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of time-of-day on elementary students' accuracy in computing mathematical algorithms. This study used an explanatory mixed methods design to collect data on addition quizzes at three different times of the day over a period of three weeks. This study also used a student questionnaire so that students could reflect and explain when they felt they concentrated the best on the quizzes. The sample population used in this study includes eighteen third grade students from a suburban elementary school. An analysis of variance was performed on the data. Findings were not significant for the time-of-day on student performance on the quizzes. An examination of the mean scores showed a trend toward higher scores in the morning, followed by the mid-morning, then the afternoon. The responses to the student questionnaires revealed trends in why they felt they concentrated best at different times, but the responses did not correspond to any particular time-of-day. The results of this study add further information on the effects time-of-day has on student performance in mathematics.

        "description":"This research report was written on the premise of devising an intervention module for wellness among at-risk community college students, which can enhance retention within the group. Barriers to retention cannot solely be eradicated by didactic remedial services of a core curriculum; there must be a dichotomy of intervention, which includes building academic competency as well as intervention strategies for enhancing social functioning with an emphasis on life-skills that incorporates the family-life cycle. This report was structured into three sections, entitled the breadth, depth, and application. The breadth discusses how community colleges have historically been on the forefront for educational opportunity for many urban dwellers and how these institutions have awarded degrees to numerous individuals. The depth is a review of some contemporary research that indicates that students have reported that family-life was an impeding factor for retention. Currently, there is a need for social intervention strategies to be devised and implemented among at-risk students who attend these institutions. The application explores a proposed intervention module that can be implemented to assist with restoring wellness among at-risk community college students with an emphasis on family-life, which can enhance retention. This wellness module was devised from a family systems theory perspective, which states that if one family member is experiencing a problem, then all family members are affected by that problem, and the problem is deemed as a family-problem. This intervention module can build resilience among many community college students who have barriers to retention, on the basis of having multi-tasking roles from family-life, employment, and academia. Students will be taught coping skills for multi-tasking as well as how to utilize resources. Last, based on current literature in higher education, counselors and educators will need to devise more intervention strategies for effective communication skills and understanding behavior dynamics among students within a multicultural global community.",

        "description":"During the last twenty years, there has been a shift in the academy's philosophy regarding Teaching Assistants (TAs). Consequently, TAs are no longer rated and trained by how useful they are to the university, but rather by their usefulness to the future professoriate. In order to successfully launch a training program that satisfies this philosophical shift, further research is needed. This review of TA training literature focuses on different categories of pre-existing training research throughout the academy. These focuses include the: (1) history of TA training in the academy and the different points of view regarding the system itself; (2) needs of the institution and the constraints of individual TA systems; (3) contradictory roles demanded of TAs and the developmental stages of individual TAs; (4) successful national TA training programs and their methods; and (5) several weaknesses of the common workshop approach. By closely examining the research, this project shows that, although there has been a shift in the academy's philosophy regarding TA training, training practices have not changed much over the last twenty years. In order to create a more cohesive practicum that evolves with the developmental stages of individual TAs and allows for the integration of developmentally appropriate training methods, this study argues that five specific principles should be adopted within current TA training programs. These solutions can be implemented quite successfully in institutionally effective ways. As an example, this study applies these five principles to a departmentally based composition TA training program at North Carolina State University. The example incorporates the following guiding principles that call for composition-based TA training programs to: (1) unify training with the university system in order to create attainable goals and objectives for TA training programs; (2) consider the developmental stages of individual TAs to target effective TA training practices at developmentally appropriate stages; (3) vary their training approaches to meet the needs of the various individual developmental stages; (4) directly link the theoretical to the practical aspects of teaching, in order to create more reflective practitioners; and (5) evaluate their practices more effectively in order to help substantiate which training practices offer the greatest returns. Accordingly, TA training programs within English departments should consider integrating these principles to create and justify a program that considers more than the skills-based aspects of teaching, but rather one that integrates the theoretical and the pedagogical aspects as well. The course syllabus is appended. (Contains 6 tables and 5 endnotes.) [M.A. Thesis, North Carolina State University.]",

        "author":["Miholic, Vincent, Comp."],
        "description":"This volume presents a compilation of approaches, theory, processes, and experiences for teachers of writing and, by extension, student writers at all levels. The following mixture of theory and consistent applications amply answer this criticism and provide a generous blend of cognitive, metacognitive and affective realms of creativity as well as the basic bones teaching advice on matters concrete and organic. Inspired by Edward Fry's \"Ten Best Ideas for Reading Teachers\" (1991), an invitation was sent to well over one hundred university and community college English teachers, educational theorists, professors, writing center directors, and editors during the 2003-04 academic year. The list was culled by searching bibliographies of current English and pedagogical journals. Each contributor was asked to generate a personal, ten-item list of ideas on theory and strategic approaches. Basic guiding questions for the exercise were these: \"What do good writers do?\"; \"How does one become a better writer?\"; and \"From what we have learned in the past twenty years, how do we best teach writing.\" The only format constraint for contributors was to attach the numerals 1 through 10 to their ideas. One of the desired outcomes in the production of this monograph was to provide a bridge across the thinking that often separates \"teacher\" and \"learner,\" so as the project unfolded, ideas appealing to teachers directly (theory and pedagogy) or specific approaches addressing the task of writing generally were neither discouraged nor viewed as mutually exclusive. The common denominator remained: readers are invited to explore and carve out those aspects they find the most useful, provocative, or stimulating. A second desired end is to stimulate learning and conversations about what writers do, and, moreover to question, test, and discuss issues related to the teaching of writing. (Contains an index.)",

We sought to assess attitudes and attitude change regarding contemporary issues in education (i.e., grade retention, inclusive education, learning strategies instruction, cooperative learning, and classroom management), among students (N = 124) enrolled in a second-year educational psychology course. Comparison of pre- and post-course Likert ratings indicated that these pre-service teachers modified their attitudes regarding grade retention, inclusive education, and classroom management but not with regard to learning strategies instruction and cooperative learning.

Constructivism refers to educational practices that are student-focused, meaning-based, process-oriented, interactive, and responsive to student interest. There is disagreement regarding which curricular orientation best serves the educational needs of children. Evaluative outcome research is contradictory and the superiority of either instructional orientation has not been clearly established. A combination of instructional methods may ultimately prove most beneficial. For example, intensely teacher-mediated lessons could be sprinkled throughout the school day, thereby minimizing teacher and student mechanization while maximizing student achievement gains. Instructionist-constructivism would promote systematic instruction within a context of individual meaning and personal interest. For example, skills such as spelling and grammar, rather than taught in isolation, could be embedded in meaningful literacy activities. Extreme and exclusionary instructional methods may be the ultimate threat to effective education.",

In contrast, instructionism refers to a collection of educational practices that are teacher-focused, skill-based, product-oriented, non-interactive, and highly prescribed. In the context of reading instruction, constructivist theoretical assumptions are reflected in whole language learning; instructionist theoretical assumptions are manifest in remedial reading. Constructivist remediation is teacher-controlled and skill-directed instruction delivered in a context that is personally meaningful to students. Both constructivist and instructionist assumptions are acknowledged and combined to provide the foundation upon which specific skill deficits are identified and corrected in meaningful context. Constructivist remediation is conceptualized and presented in terms of seven critical elements that are integrated and interdependent. Core skills remediation in 1) phonological processing, 2) sight word vocabulary, and 3) reading comprehension, based upon 4) authentic individual student assessment, are taught in instructional contexts made meaningful by 5) whole pieces of literature, 6) integration of literacy and language development, and 7) enhanced student motivation through self-selected, functional learning activities.",

The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the ways in which remedial readers respond to the activity of reading aloud to a dog at the resource reading lab at a suburban, public, elementary school in Northern California. Through observations, interviews and surveys, the feelings, perceptions and beliefs of four students and their parents, and the two literacy assistants at the research site are determined.

However, if a movie's plot crosses the line between good and bad science, skeptical eyebrows within the mainstream scientific community begin to rise. Very little research has been conducted on whether factual errors in science fiction movies might generate or perpetuate students' alternative conceptions. This study examines students' conceptions of some key scientific ideas after watching two selected science fiction movies. Our purpose is twofold: 1) To find whether science fiction movies sometimes generate or contribute to students' alternative conceptions. 2) To examine the potential of science fiction movies as an evaluative tool for exposing common patterns of student alternative conceptions so that these may be addressed by subsequent directed instruction. It is suggested that science fiction movies are especially useful in this regard because they prompt students to reveal alternative conceptions which although common in our culture may otherwise remain hidden even if the students are directly asked.

First, the benefits of both approaches are described. Examples of ways in which teacher centered classes using thoughtful questioning techniques or focused lectures enhance learning are presented. The necessity for authentic material to develop student skills in a learner centered activity is also emphasized. The second section demonstrates how instructors can improve their teaching and increase student learning by combining both teacher and learner centered approaches in the initiation to research paper writing module of a freshman English course and the improved student participation and benefit from an argumentative writing class. Qualitative results suggest that both students and instructor were more motivated and benefited from their class time. When an instructor emphasizes what a student must DO during a class session with what the instructor must also DO rather than emphasizing methodology from a purely structured point of view, learning should take place. Educators need to worry less about the classification of their teaching methodology and stress more on the practicality and desired outcomes of the activities they use to meet their teaching objectives (2 activity sheets).",

Although perceptual motor development has emerged as a very important instrument for the development of academic skills of those afflicted by the impairment, its reliability has become questionable. (See Salvia & Ysseldyke, 2004, p. 538). Psychometric purists suggest is one of the most difficult areas of assessment in the history of psycho-education and medical science. Is it simply because of the inconsistency of measurement which compromises the reliability and validity of the test or mere inconsistency? Bender (1938) suggests, \"the BVMGT consists of nine geometric designs.\" Through this vein, (Salvia & Ysseldyke, 2004, p.538) infers, \"The majority of research has shown, however, that most perceptual motor tests are unreliable.\" Why is (Koppitz (1995) book commendable? Yet it played down the need of any review of the literature. This concept perplexes the researcher, as the review of the literature is an essential part of any study. More importantly, because researchers have made these prognostications and judgments about perceptual motor tests, the researcher is about to delve deeper into the causes and effects to find out why these tests have negative outcomes, as well as to ascertain from previous studies whether those researchers recommended that their studies be subjected to further study or replication. In this instance, there seems to be adequate identification of the performance gap, in that improving locomotive skills, hand-eye and foot-eye coordination are recognizable gaps that merit intervention. Thus, the necessary intervention is employed to close the performance gap.",

This study examined what sorts of themes and images might resonate across nationalities and cultures, which could then be used as tools to aid an instructional framework for international education. The study employed mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to identify and analyze transculturally (culturally transcendent) resonant images and themes. International students viewed and rated a series of video clips presented in the context of global business courses. The study findings indicate applied themes and images including babies, animals, relationships, sports, life cycles, and self-image may help evoke a positive transcultural resonance. The findings were used to consider instructional applications for more effective learning in international classroom settings. These findings may also provide a foundation for international educator training, as well as enhanced accessibility to global education significant to inclusive social change.

        "author":["Martin, Jennifer L."],
        "description":"This intervention study examines the problem of sexual harassment in an alternative high school for at-risk students. It was hypothesized that creating a forum where girls felt safe to share their experiences would increase their awareness of sexual harassment and its effects, eventually contributing to a decrease in incidents of sexual harassment occurring in the school by providing girls with strategies to deal with it. It was further hypothesized that perceptions of students' loci of control would become more internal after the intervention and thus subjects would feel they had more control over their lives and bodies. Subjects' attitudes were measured using three instruments which provided pre-intervention baseline data: a newly created instrument used to measure student perceptions of sexual harassment, a revised version of the abbreviated adolescent &quot;Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale&quot; (1971), and the &quot;Bem Sex Role Inventory&quot; (1978/1981) Subjects were post-tested twice following the end of the semester-long intervention, two months after the end of the course, and four months after the end of the course. Both post-tests consisted of the same three measures as the pre-test. Analyses of post-intervention data revealed that students reported having experienced sexual harassment, witnessing sexual harassment, or knowing others who had experienced sexual harassment with greater frequency after the intervention. Analysis of data at the time of post-intervention 2 revealed that students' knowledge of sexual harassment gained from the intervention had been retained. Analysis of qualitative survey data prior to and after the intervention suggested that students who had not experienced sexual harassment were more likely to state that they would report sexual harassment if they experienced it than were students who actually experienced sexual harassment. Analysis of post-intervention data and administrative referral data revealed that students sexual harassment they experienced more frequently than they did prior to the intervention. Finally, results of the locus of control instrument used in this study revealed that subjects' perceptions of their levels of internality increased over time: the students' loci of control became increasingly more internal at the time of  post-intervention 1. This increase continued to the time of post-intervention 2.

There is a vast difference between a learning difficulty and a learning disability; an individual with learning difficulty can learn using conventional teaching techniques while LD requires specialized interventions which depend on the type of disability. The most common forms of LD are dyslexia--also known as word blindness, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and short term memory dysfunction. LD can result from injury; it can be hereditary; it can come in many forms.  Although it is no longer considered a form of mental retardation, it is now known that true LD is directly related to some type of brain malfunction. The study of LD did not originate in the 1960s--as some people believe--but actually spans the time from Napoleonic reign to space age exploration.  Scientists, researchers, and educators know quite a bit about LD now, but they still do not know nearly enough to help the multitude of individuals afflicted with those conditions.",

The dream of improving and transforming education through technology became possible as a result of collaboration between the New York City Board of Education's Region 2 and Fordham University's Educational Technology Center, fondly known to us as R2DII. As a Reading and Academic Intervention Specialist, assigned to the First Grade classrooms at the P.S. 83 Annex during the 04/05 school year, I had the unique opportunity to introduce instructional technology to seven year olds. What a challenge! The way to get the students focused on their travels through the Net was through a WebQuest. In the Butterfly WebQuest, the students concentrated on three specific roles: Researchers, Scientists, and Dieticians. Websites were available to search for the answers to the questions appropriate for each role. Judging by our National Standards in Language Arts, Science, and Technology, the results of the traditional and alternative assessments given to these students are clear indications of reaching high performances, way above their grade levels. The final written presentations of these students were equivalent to those expected from a third grader's reading and writing abilities. Their knowledge of science content reached the outer limits of a fourth grader's benchmarks. Their competencies in the operations, concepts, productivity and research tools of computer technology were within the spectrum of a fifth grader's accomplishments.",

        "description":"Video provides (1) simultaneous audio/visual input, and (2) complete and contextualized conversations, and thus proves to be a rich vehicle in foreign language instruction. The video drama \"Connect with English\" (a.k.a. \"Rebecca's Dream\"), created to promote English language learning, is particularly outstanding in that it contains an captivating storyline, true-to-life scenarios, on-location scenes, various social interactions, realistic yet easy-to-follow linguistic and cultural information, as well as high-quality filming and acting. This paper discusses how \"Connect with English\" can help enhance learners' intercultural communicative competence on three levels: cultural awareness, phraseological accuracy, and pragmatic appropriateness. It delineates some of the underlying thought patterns--the values, attitudes, and feelings--in the U.S. society that are portrayed in this drama and shows how they provide insights into the English language norms. Viewing this drama, learners observe American social, cultural, and discoursal conventions, and even go through a range of emotional experiences along with the characters. They may develop a better understanding of the U.S. social reality and the English-specific ways of thinking, of lexical/syntactic choices, and of formulaic expressions. As a result, learners may find viewing this drama an effective way to increase their cross-cultural language power. Finally, the importance of approximating sociolinguistically appropriate English language models to minimize the negative effect of native language transfer is emphasized.

Well known, in addition to burgeoning, human psychosocial development models that considered older adulthood were chosen for their inclusion of the topic of death amid the aging experience. Two overarching perspectives of death in relation to human development resulted. One was the \"thanatos\" perspective, which generally viewed death as a purposeful component of human development, while the \"transcendental\" perspective saw death as something to be conquered or transcended through development. The phenomenon of death possesses an undeniable association with aging and the course of psychosocial development during the life span, especially in older adulthood. Death is a critical element in the discourse of human development and aging. Emerging theoretical frameworks of psychosocial development, especially gerontological models, must admit to the primacy of human mortality in understanding human growth, decline, and transitions.

        "author":["Li, Xin"],
        "description":"Using King and Kitchener's model of reflective judgment as a framework, I inquired and examined critical reflective thinking skills of myself and my pre-service and in-service teachers in the process of developing a multicultural autobiographical curriculum in 4 years. I explored, in a narrative inquiry mode, my historical cross-cultural self and how I connected this self to my immediate teaching environment in preparation for the curriculum. In the first two years, I integrated my prior intersubjective self study method into the multicultural teacher education courses, and developed a narrative inquiry based curriculum to help students better understand their own cultural identities. The complexity of culture and self was emphasized in identifying their relations with six cultural groups: race/ethnicity, social class, religion, gender/sexuality, language, and exceptionality/learning ability. In order to guide the students to make meaning of their multicultural identities in a teaching situation, they reconstructed teacher stories about their most influential teachers. To further connect their identities with theories in multicultural education, they developed personal philosophies of multicultural education. From the reconstructed narrative statement of my experience in preparing and implementing the curriculum, I found myself using critical reflective thinking skills. Based on my evaluation of 400 students' journal writings and pre- and post-multicultural autobiographies, I found their critical reflective thinking skills increased. In the last two years, I further integrated the tradition of thick description to help students break through their preconceived assumptions about themselves. Service-learning and a service-learning recipient's multicultural biography were included to bring cultural contrasting relationships into students' autobiographical experience. Banks' typologies of cultural identity development and cross-cultural competence in multicultural e were introduced to help students better situate themselves developmentally. Such hybrid curriculum further increased students' critical reflective thinking skills. Examining pre- and post multicultural autobiographies from 600 students in the 4 years of curriculum development, I found the levels of students' critical reflective thinking skills about themselves increased significantly, although the average level does not measure up to that in King and Kitchener's research. Appended are: (1) Summary of King and Kitchener's Model of Seven Stage Reflective Judgment; (2) Summary of Banks' 6-Stage-Typology of Cultural Identity; and (3) Summary of Banks' 4-Type-Typology of Cross-Cultural Teachers.",

Beyond our similar ethnic and gender backgrounds, we found each other from warring social classes in China. Underneath our differences, we recovered the Taoist intersubjective knowing as our common deep identity with the Chinese culture. I further developed this research with my former student--a Mexican-American male teacher. Underneath our different and opposing gender, social class, and ethnic identities, we reconstructed the Buberian ontology of I and Thou as our common way of relating to each other, listening to and telling each other's cultural stories. We transcended our differences, and reconstructed our identities as fuller cultural beings.

        "description":"This paper addresses two audiences--those who design education trend studies that simultaneously have longitudinal and intercohort implications, and the secondary analysts who use such trend data. Four study series conducted for the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) provide material for the paper: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002). The paper considers the balance between the need for continuity--to ensure comparability of findings and estimates over time; and change--to adapt to new educational circumstances and evolving policy and research agendas, and exploit new technological opportunities for improving data collection, data quality, and data accessibility. For the benefit of analysts of the four data sets, intercohort comparison points are identified, and caveats about aspects of non-comparability (ranging from changing eligibility and exclusion criteria to mode of administration effects) entered. For the benefit of survey developers, the following recommendations are made: definitions and procedures must be standardized to the extent possible; departures from past practice must be thoroughly documented; more methodological work (including &quot;bridge&quot; studies) is needed to test the implications of changes in content, format, and procedure over time.

        "title":"Teaching Support Measures for Secondary Vocational Teachers Teaching Mentally Retarded Students in Taiwan, Republic of China",
        "author":["Wu, Robert T. Y."],
        "description":"According to the Special Education Act of 1984, all the citizens have equal rights of education and work, so do the disabled. Because the mainstreaming concept in special education prevails in the educational arena, educators try to put retarded students in regular classes or at least in the regular learning environments (Conn, 2001). By this way, those retarded high school students can really strengthen their personal living ability, social life ability, and occupational ability (Ministry of Education, 2000). In order to fulfill the above objective of the special vocational programs, it is imperative to meet teachers' teaching support needs first. Especially when we consider the limited learning abilities of these retarded students, to educate the students requires vocational teachers to have sufficient teaching support measures which are closely related to both teaching effectiveness and students' employability (Chen, 1993; East, 1992). The purpose of this study was to explore the teaching support measures for secondary vocational teachers teaching mildly mental retarded students in senior vocational high schools in Taiwan, Republic of China. A questionnaire survey was employed as the primary research method. Subjects in this study included 407 teachers who taught special vocational education classes during the spring semester of 2002. Data was collected and analyzed using &quot;the Teaching Support Measures Questionnaire&quot;. Pilot test of the instrument was conducted to yield the formal research questionnaire. Finally, data collected was analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The major findings were: (1) The results of factor analysis indicated that there were four dimensions for teaching support measures, including parent and community involvement, administration support and advising services, in-service training, and teaching equipment in a sequential order of acquisition level. In general, the acquisition levels of the current overall  teaching support measures and the dimensions were considered to be just above average.  (2) There were significant differences in teaching support measures based on sex, special education teaching year, current job, school size, area, school type and major career field. However, no significant differences in teaching support measures were found based on age, marital status, education, teaching year, and special education background. (3) Teachers teaching special vocational education considered teaching support measures as the most urgent need. (4) &quot;Parent and community involvement&quot; was also crucial to teaching implementation, teaching activity, and transition from school to work services. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between teachers' teaching effectiveness and school effectiveness in comprehensive high schools in Taiwan, Republic of China. The establishment of comprehensive high schools signals a new type of secondary education. In order to improve the quality of education in comprehensive high schools, it is necessary to examine their school effectiveness. Furthermore, Reynolds (1998) and Wu (2002) both indicated that teachers play an important role in classroom activities. To ensure educational quality and improve school effectiveness, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between teachers' teaching effectiveness and school effectiveness of these schools. This study collected data from 832 teachers in comprehensive high schools in Taiwan during the spring semester of 2004, using a questionnaire that was composed of background information, the Teachers' Teaching Effectiveness Scale and the School Effectiveness Inventory. Pilot tests of these two instruments were conducted to yield the formal research questionnaire. Finally, the data collected was analyzed by statistical methods including frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, reliability test, t-test, one-way ANOVA, one-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance, Scheffe method, Pearson product-moment correlation, canonical correlation, and stepwise multiple regression model. The major findings and conclusions were: (1) The levels of teaching effectiveness measures of comprehensive high school teachers were moderately high, with &quot;good teacher student relationship&quot; being the highest, and &quot;teaching self efficacy&quot; being the lowest. (2) The levels of school effectiveness measures of comprehensive high schools were moderately high, with &quot;principal leadership&quot; being the highest, and &quot;curriculum implementation&quot; being the lowest. (3) Gender, age, teaching experience, teaching program, school size, type of school, and school educational level, position, school area, and school background were not related to teachers' teaching effectiveness. (4) Gender, age, teaching experience, teaching program, school area, type of school, school background, and school history were significant to school effectiveness, while educational level and position were not related to school effectiveness. (5) The higher the teachers' teaching effectiveness, the higher the school effectiveness. (6) Canonical analysis results showed that &quot;systematical presentation of instructional materials&quot; was positively related to &quot;teaching and evaluation&quot; and &quot;student achievements&quot;, and &quot;teaching self-efficacy&quot; was positively related to &quot;student achievements&quot; and &quot;teachers' job satisfaction&quot;. (7) Gender, type of school, &quot;teaching self efficacy&quot;, &quot;systematical presentation of instructional materials&quot; and &quot;good classroom climate&quot; were the five best predictors for school effectiveness. Based on the results of this study, some implications are drawn. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The underachievement of a large and growing scale of African American children is nothing short of national crisis, according to Haycock (2001) in her research on closing the achievement gap. Haycock indicates that by the year 2010, Black and Hispanics will compromise approximately fifty percent of the school population. This is an alarming situation and everyone should take it seriously since fifty percent of the future school population is not going to be performing as desired; it is really a national crisis. To close the achievement gap, a closer look at the historical perspective of African American students (where they come from and where they are going) is critical in finding the appropriate remedy. Certainly, diversity poses some negative influence on students' performance at school if the interdependence among students does not promote collaboration, trust, and mutual understanding. The curriculum could provide one of the solutions in public schools struggling to teach different ethnic groups. It is true that having multiple curricula in the same public schools is not feasible; however, the integration and differentiation of instructional delivery would be a step toward improvement. Taking into account the stereotypes of African American students, the appropriate learning delivery suitable to African American students would be collaborative learning.",

        "description":"Admission processes at community colleges typically use open door or &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; practices. This type of policy allows all applicants, regardless of prior experience or educational background, to have the same chance of admission into programs. As the number of applications increases, it becomes necessary to investigate predictors that may be used in competitive admissions. This study explores predictors for student success in the imaging programs at Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute, Hudson, North Carolina. Linear regressions were performed using GPA, persistence rates, and certification passage rates as dependent variables representing student success. Independent variables, or predictors, were placement test scores, history of developmental classes, science class scores, and advanced degrees. Historical data of students enrolled in imaging programs during the period of 2000-2004 was used in the regressions. While no correlation was found between persistence and certification rates and the predictors, there were weak associations demonstrated with GPA. Master's Regressions also demonstrated correlations between GPA and persistence rates and GPA and certification rates. It is suggested that selective admissions can influence program success by improving GPA. However, because of the restricted correlations and the possibility of other influences on success, a portion of admissions should always remain on a non-selective basis.

        "description":"Purpose: The purpose of this action research presentation is to discuss how explicit comprehension instruction can take place along with writing, in the kindergarten classroom. Methodology: This action research project took place in a suburban kindergarten with learners of diverse ability levels and ESL students as well. In this classroom small group instruction was the vehicle for literacy. The teacher worked with a small heterogeneous group of kindergarten readers. The group size was about 4-6 on a given day. This took place within the second semester of the kindergarten year. The documentation of the strategy was anecdotal and based on the principles of action research. Results: This prior knowledge activation strategy presented benefits of the children using the vocabulary from the story in their journal entries. Another benefit was that the children were forced to use their inventive spelling skills and explore the grapheme-phoneme relationship. The final benefit of this strategy was that the children were motivated more and more each time the strategy was presented to listen and have their own independent discussion of the story, the characters and its events. They even modeled the strategy when participating in center time at the reading center, independently. This strategy is one that is simple yet effective. It allows optimal participation from all members of the group and a constant flow of communication about the story. Conclusions: The outcome of analyzing and using this strategy in the classroom is that it plays upon the natural curiosity of young children as a motivator for reading. Another outcome is that the teacher found a strategy that adheres to the ability levels of all children. The relationship of this strategy to the purpose of the research is manifested in the rich discussion and authentic work samples of the students. Recommendations: It is imperative that teachers offer more strategies that activate the prior knowledge of the beginning reader. These and other developmentally appropriate strategies with regards to cultural and linguistic diversity make for lifelong learners and independent readers.",

Exposure to a foreign language has been emphasized as one of the crucial conditions in order to achieve proficiency in that language (Dornyei &amp; Skehan, 2003; Freeman, 1999). On the other hand, the lack of language input, or little exposure to English, has been pointed out as one of the obstacles in the EFL context, such as learning English in Korea. One hundred and one (101) Korean university students participated in the survey that investigates what kinds of and how much English they contact outside the class. The survey questionnaire used in the present study was modified from &quot;The Language Contact Profile&quot; that was developed by Freed et al (2004). The participants were asked to state how much time they spend on 16 activities in speaking, listening, reading and writing in English outside of the class. The results suggest that the majority of the participants do not speak or write in English at all and most of students' writing and reading activities are limited to their course related materials. In the conclusion, the pedagogical implications of the finding are suggested. A Language Contact Profile is appended. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Short stories, for example, help students to learn the four skills--listening, speaking, reading and writing--more effectively because of the motivational benefit embedded in the stories. In addition, with short stories, instructors can teach literary, cultural, and higher-order thinking benefits. However, before novice instructors attempt to use short stories in their EFL classes, they should understand the benefits of short stories and plan classes that meet the needs of their students. \"The Wisdom of Solomon\" is appended.",

        "description":"American colleges and universities rely on a system of shared governance that includes the voluntary involvement of faculty to assist in the decision-making process. With a culture of democratic involvement and an expectation to participate in the democratic process generally, American citizens are accustomed to this type of involvement, regardless of whether or not they choose to participate. For citizens of other countries, however, this can be completely contrary to their conceptions of community involvement. In some countries, simply, there is no individual involvement in determining societal expectations, behaviors, or responses. Therefore, this study was designed to explore how citizens of those countries who have come to join US college and university faculty governance bodies exercise their right to involvement. Drawing on a sample of faculty who were socialized and originally from Mainland China, a survey of nearly 100 faculty was completed. Findings suggest that these faculty take their responsibilities on a faculty governance unit seriously and see their role as one of importance and based on their responsibility to the institution. The resulting conclusion of the study was that civic responsibility of immigrant groups, particularly those from non-democratic societies, can be polarized between the very involved and committed to those who are completely disengaged.

Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) has become an umbrella term covering a wide variety of approaches to cross-curricular language/content teaching currently taking place in diverse educational contexts. European CLIL incentives are driven by socio-political factors based on the European Union's vision of a multilingual Europe and the consequent need for improvements in language teaching approaches and methods. National projects exist in most European countries, while a number of research organisations operate on a transnational level. While the theory behind CLIL is sound, development of teacher training programmes and content-based materials is required to make CLIL practicable on a larger scale.",

        "description":"The United States Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is 30 years of age. IDEA affords individuals with physical or cognitive disabilities (through age 21) a free appropriate public education, an individualized education plan, and many accommodations in an attempt to include those with disabilities in the educational experience. Throughout its brief history, the party in power has, through amendment of the law, presidential action or inaction, or litigation opened the door to those with disabilities in some cases and supported de facto exclusion in others. This paper displays a timeline tracing the effects of the legislation, in its various forms, on the disabled populace. All manifestations of the law will were examined: from its origin during the Ford administration; amendments in the George Herbert Walker Bush and Clinton administrations, to reauthorization under the current government. Corresponding litigation brought by advocates and opponents was dissected as to its effects on education access for those with disabilities. Additionally, the effects of educational reform on students with disabilities are examined by discussion of the controversial &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; law. Finally, the paper discusses the 2004 election results and its probable implications on the future of disability education legislation.",

The study explored the extent to which the self-regulated learning strategies of metacognition, elaboration, critical thinking, organization, rehearsal, time and effort management, help seeking and peer learning vary with gender. The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) was administered to 198 undergraduate students at a large university in Northeastern U.S. The obtained data were analyzed through multivariate analysis of variance. The study uncovered several statistically significant differences. Female students tended to over-report the use of rehearsal, organization, metacognition, time management skills, elaboration, and effort. No statistically significant gender differences were found with respect to studying with peers, help seeking, and critical thinking skills. (Contains 1 figure.)",

This paper describes the use of a revised version of the Reflective Pedagogical Thinking Scale (Sparks-Langer, et al., 1990) to measure reflectivity. The original scale was used by the developers to assess reflectivity through a structured interview. The present study employs a revised version of the scale to assess reflectivity based on student teachers' weekly journal writings. The participants consisted of 223 student teachers from Batu Lintang Teachers College who were undergoing their first phase of their student teaching practicum of six weeks. Student teachers' practicum journals were collected at the end of the practicum and each participant's level of reflectivity was assessed through the use of the revised reflective pedagogical thinking rating scale. Results of the analyses indicate that student teachers were hardly reflective, exhibiting very low levels of reflectivity based on van Manen's classification of levels of reflectivity. Interpretations of the results and recommendations are discussed in relation to the context of the study. (Contains 2 tables.)",

To achieve these purposes, Teaching Style Inventory and Background Questionnaire were administered to science teachers in Tallahassee, Florida. Data analysis indicates that teaching styles are placed between teacher-student cooperation style and student-centered style. The results show some patterns between teachers' teaching styles and their educational majors, professional development, and years of experience. The evidence from the data indicates that teachers with higher degree in the field of education hold more student-centered teaching styles. Moreover, the data from this study suggest that participation of professional activities (e.g., workshops, training) favors more student-centered approach. Results related to teachers' experiences in education reveal a different pattern comparing to other effects in the model. Teachers with experience from 1 through 9 years are more likely to utilize a student-directed approach comparing to more experienced teachers. Teachers who recently graduated from college could be more aware of new innovative teaching and learning techniques than teachers who have more than 9 years of experience.

The purpose of this study was to determine how students' discourses of race, class, and gender influences their responses to multicultural literature as well as how students adopted alternative discourses through coping with the tensions portrayed in multicultural literature. The participants in this study consisted of 14 high school students--eight females and six males of whom nine were white; three, Asian-American; one, Hispanic, and one, a student of African descent, enrolled in a multicultural literature class taught by one of the researchers/authors, Daryl Parks, in Fall, 2001, in Thompson High School, a diverse, urban high school of 1,600 students in a \"working class\" section of a large, Midwestern city with a student body of 42 percent White, 30 percent Asian, 17 percent African, 10 percent Hispanic and one percent Native American. Students' journal and discussion responses to a range of different multicultural literature texts as well as interviews about their perceptions of themselves and the course were analyzed using critical discourse analysis based on coding of the different types of discourses adopted by participants. Results indicated that students' responses were influenced by three different factors: the teacher's modeling of alternative ways of thinking about texts by adopting alternative perspectives; responses to texts in which students experienced characters challenging status-quo discourses and institutional forces; and context, in which student challenges to each others' discourses led students to revise their discourses. In experiencing characters interrogating ideological forces limiting their development, students began to examine forces in their own lives limiting their own development. Students who shifted in their discourses over alternative perspective on themselves and their worlds. These results suggests the need in conducting research on teaching literature to examine the influence of all three factors--teacher modeling, texts, and contexts on shifts in students' thinking about literature.",

Although, in-service courses are offered to enhance the teachers' professional skills but the courses are not relevant to their needs. This may be due to the administrators' assumptions of the teachers' needs rather than what the teachers actually need to be effective in their classes. This study's aim was to identify the perceived professional needs of mathematics teachers.

The items in the questionnaires were divided into six categories, namely materials, new knowledge, methods of teaching, teaching marginal students, computer and calculator use and measurement. Descriptive statistics were employed in this study. Analysis of data revealed that the highest rated perceived needs were related to the remediation of low achieving students. The least preferred perceived needs were related to calculator usage, delivering mathematics instruction in English and selection of new textbooks. Finally, the study indicates that professional development programs should be relevant to teachers' needs and made available when requested. (Contains 4 tables.)",

This pattern of results from the four constituent groups highlights the challenges in using survey data. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate if there are any significant differences in the mathematical attainment of pupils' grade one of primary school in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A) between those pupils who had attended kindergarten and their peers who had not, and whether this effect continued into the second and third grades in mathematics attainment. Also the study aimed to investigate the role that teachers' expectation for their students' achievement might play in accounting for any differences. This study was limited to 685 primary fourth grades pupils (special need not include) who had progressed through the first, second and third grades of the primary school in the city of Makkah (K.S.A) in the academic year of 2002-2003 drawn from the 40 primary schools, randomly selected from the four areas in the city of Makkah (North, South, East, and West of Makkah) 20 schools for boys and 20 schools for girls. 417 of pupils sample had attended kindergarten (294 boys and 123 girls) and 268 of pupils had not (106 boys and 162 girls). Two main methods of data collection were used in this study: a) mathematical scores of final exam the total mathematical scores that the pupils had achieved in the three grades (first grade 1999, second grade 2000, and third grade 2001) were collected from the administration office of each of the schools, and b) teachers' questionnaire consisted of questions to elicit information on the teachers' view about the importance of kindergarten education, as well as their view about the academic and social adjustment differences, if any, between primary school pupils with kindergarten education background and their peers without such an experience. The result of the study indicated that: (1) the pupils who had attended kindergarten significantly out-performed their peers who had not attended kindergarten in the first grade and the effect was continued in the second and third grades; (2) the gender of pupils who had attended kindergarten did not affect mathematical attainment in the three grades of primary school, although the girls who had not attended kindergarten were better than the boys. This trend of the impact of kindergarten education on mathematics achievement at the early primary school level was corroborated by the opinions of the primary school teachers, who concurred with the notion of the positive effect of kindergarten education on its recipients. Finally the results concluded that there is a strong indication that attending kindergarten has been shown to be effective in supporting the mathematical education of primary age children If this is so, then it appears to us that all children should attend kindergarten before joining primary school, therefore, it is recommended that Saudi Arabian government should work towards universalizing kindergarten education. Integrating kindergarten education into the current basic education could do this. Appended are: (1) tabular data; (2) open-ended questionnaire; and (3) close-ended questionnaire.

        "author":["MacFarland, Thomas W."],
        "description":"Nova Southeastern University is the 10th largest private, not-for-profit, postsecondary institution in the United States, based on Fall Term 2002 unduplicated enrollment statistics reported to the National Center for Education Statistics. It was recently announced that Nova Southeastern University plans to build a $500 million academic village, with an emphasis on research and medicine. This academic village will further increase the University's size and subsequent impact on Florida's economy. The purpose of this study is to provide a projected estimate of Nova Southeastern University's impact on Florida's economy in 2010, due not only to student enrollment but also because of the planned $500 million academic village and the creation of new jobs related to research activities and medicine. As these estimates are determined, this study will also provide another tool for the University to communicate with the public about its many services and social and economic contributions to the community. Various reports in the literature related to technology and university-affiliated medical research were reviewed and applied against a conservative set of parameters and assumptions specific to Nova Southeastern University. Based on these parameters and assumptions, by 2010, when unduplicated enrollment may possibly reach 30,000 or more Fall Term students and the many facilities associated with the academic village come online, Nova Southeastern University may be responsible for a more than $1.6 billion impact on Florida's economy: $1.2 billion due to expenses and spending related to student enrollment and $0.4 billion from the medical and research intensive planned academic village. The University's contribution to Florida's economy continues to grow and it will rapidly increase as the $500 million academic village comes online and provides service opportunities and the infusion of new money into the economy.

        "author":["Tunon, Johanna",
          "Brydges, Bruce"],
        "description":"University libraries are becoming increasingly aware of the need to assess the quality of students' information literacy and library research skills and to use this assessment data to effectively improve the quality of university library services to graduate programs. However, libraries have had difficulties finding ways to accomplish this both systematically and objectively. This study examined the relative merits of using citation analysis and evaluative bibliometric techniques to &quot;mine&quot; reference lists obtained from doctoral dissertations for assessment purposes. In the past, citation analysis has been used in libraries for collection development and to assess the quality of undergraduate students' library research skills. Citation analysis, however, also has the advantage of being an unobtrusive and non-invasive analytical tool that can be used to quantify students' meta-cognitive skills, beyond basic informational and procedural knowledge as captured by a pretest/posttest evaluation. This study builds on three recent works: Two studies (Beile, Boote, &amp; Killingsworth, 2003, Haycock, 2004) used citation analysis to examine the scholarly nature of education dissertations, while another study (Green &amp; Bowser, 2003) developed a rubric to examine the effect of a faculty/librarian collaboration on the quality of literature reviews in education dissertations. The current study, while applying both techniques to reference lists of 143 doctoral applied dissertations' from the Child and Youth Studies program at Nova Southeastern University, goes the next step by creating a method of citation analysis for the purpose of gathering evaluative, bibliometric data. The writers developed an objective rubric that mechanically awarded points for currency, type of document, and certain  document-specific criteria, while the second rubric employed a subjective assessment based on the judgment of two assessors using five criteria (number and variety of types of documents cited,of understanding as demonstrated through the inclusion of theoretical and background documents as well as scholarliness, currency, and relevancy of the resources). Qualitative descriptors were used to score the criteria on a four-point scale. A comparison of the two overall scores provides evaluative evidence of the quality of students' library research skills as demonstrated in this graduate capstone endeavor. (Contains 8 tables.)",

        "author":["Brawdy, Paul J."],
        "description":"This paper focuses on the use of outdoor-based experiential learning in an undergraduate physical education teacher preparation program to develop a culturally-sensitive pedagogy for work with children from different cultures. Applying the six-stage process for becoming a bi-cultural teacher (Klug &amp; Whitfield, 2003), teacher preparation students participated in a model action research assignment that focused on the lived experience of the Seneca Indian in Western New York. The stages of this process included: (1) Learning stereotypes and prejudices of native peoples; (2) Confronting one's personal prejudice; (3) Redefining one's perceptions of Native American cultures; (4) Opening one's self to new experiences; (5) Adjustment and re-shaping of one's cultural identity; and (6) Transformation in one's practice as a teacher. Complimenting student interviews, school visits, field trips, and invited distinguished speakers, all students participated in a three-day backpacking trek through a region holding much historic significance for contemporary Seneca-US relations. Flooded in 1966 as a part of the Pittsburgh Flood Control Project, the upper Allegheny River valley was once home to more than 160 Seneca families and, is still, the spiritual birthplace of the Longhouse Religion founded by Seneca prophet Handsome Lake. An abrogation of the 1792 Pickering Treaty, the flooding of these lands represents a great injustice to many Seneca today. Through the use of a backpacking trek into this region, students visit a number of remote sites and observe and reflect upon artifacts of an earlier existence along the Allegheny River prior to the relocation of valley's inhabitants. Student action research papers, generated from individual data collection processes, personal journals and reflective insights are used to establish generative themes evolving throughout the action research process.",

        "description":"Long distance education has been a part of instructional delivery for more than one hundred years. Beginning as correspondence study accompanying the establishment of national postal systems, distance education has undergone dramatic change fueled by the rapid and recent explosion of technology. This exponential growth in technology has provided educators with new delivery methods for instruction, allowing post-secondary schools to reach greater numbers of students through the enrollment of individuals who would ordinarily be unable to attend traditional on-site classes. The purpose of this research was to obtain data on the numbers of courses and programs and delivery methods for distance education within a 150 mile radius of Chattanooga, TN. Data were obtained from 99 of the 104 post-secondary institutions within the survey area. Data collection was accomplished using surveys completed through telephone interviews, email inquiries, and information available at web site hosted by institutions in the target population. Initial information about the post-secondary institutions in the survey area was first obtained through state education department sources or Internet sources. This information included the type of school (two-year private colleges, four-year private colleges and universities, two-year community and technical colleges, two-year public senior colleges and universities, or four-year public colleges and universities), address, telephone number, email address, etc. Next the post-secondary institutions were contacted via email or telephone and the survey was administered. The results of this study can be used to evaluate the long distance learning programs that are currently offered by post-secondary schools within a 150-mile radius of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Distance education is relatively young in the history of education and has experienced rapid growth during the past several decades, particularly with regard to the online delivery of instruction. Distance education provides educational opportunities to individuals that are separated by distance and/or time, allowing instruction in remote locations. Appended are: (1) Long Distance Learning Survey; (2) Numbers of Post-Secondary Institutions by Data Collection Method; and (3) Types of Degree Programs Offered through Distance Education in the Survey Area.

Adjunct employment circumstances and workplace conditions often differ from those of full-time faculty, thus posing many challenges and impediments to facilitating instructional technology and information technology in Adjunct-taught courses. This Monograph accompanied a presentation by the author, an Adjunct faculty member at a CUNY college, that highlighted various issues in bringing technological currency to Adjunct-instructed courses, using &quot;case method&quot; discussion of several illustrative scenarios derived from actual CUNY Adjunct situations. Issues covered include the failure of college administrations to adequately avail information technology resources to Adjunct faculty, to adequately communicate the availability of whatever is available to the Adjunct faculty member, and to adequately train and support the Adjunct faculty member who seeks to use the technology. Also discussed are technology compatibility issues and security issues as they pertain to Adjuncts. The foregoing issues are viewed in conjunction with the campus social dynamics as they affect Adjunct faculty members, including the attenuation of many Adjuncts (especially those who teach evening and weekend classes) from the channels of social communication, and the ingrained negative attitudes, personal and institutional, towards Adjunct faculty members. This Monograph concludes that CUNY's grand plans to enhance its instructional technology currency must embrace its Adjunct faculty members, and that direction and example for doing so must be promulgated from the top levels of CUNY leadership.

The first section addressed the advantages of using weblogs in cooperative learning structure on teaching and learning. Attention then turned to issues of opportunities to participate in writing class. For the purpose of this study, the number and content of text contributions made by group members in the blogs including the online responses or asynchronous communication were analyzed. Results indicated that two thirds of learners agreed that using asynchronous communication improved the students' academic development. The benefits of cooperative learning within weblog networks in terms of learner autonomy, cooperative learning, and time management were then illustrated. Educator should stress on the emergence of the insights regarding how technology meets and supports the needs of students. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

What appears, according to the data, to make the biggest difference  in students' being ready to read at the college level is something that, for the most part, is neither addressed in state standards nor reflected in the high school curriculum. This report offers insights into how state standards in reading can be strengthened and how reading instruction at the high school level can be changed to positively impact students' reading achievement.

        "description":"The effects of education on people's income are well documented in the economics literature, and the benefits of investing in human capital--in terms of both higher earnings and of other economic and social benefits--are popular research topics for economists and other social scientists. The present study explores the effects of public education expenditures on the distribution of income among people living in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The study's basic premise is that, since a state's income level depends on its residents' educational level then the income distribution within each state is dependent on the distribution of educational levels among its residents. There are, of course, other factors contributing to income level dispersion within a state, and these variables' effects are also considered. This reports chapters are: (1) Income and Poverty Trends and Distribution; (2) Methodology; (3) Empirical Results; and (4) Conclusions. There are two appendixes of summary and supporting tables and a bibliography that combines both referenced and non-referenced citations. The Trends and Distribution chapter discusses income distributions across the fifty states and the District of Columbia and compares other statistical characteristics, such as differences in public education spending. National trends in income equality from 1970 to 2000 are discussed, as well as trends in other state socioeconomic variables. (Contains 3 figures and 15 tables.)",

        "author":["Petko, Mike"],
        "description":"This paper partially fulfills the charge set out by New Business Item (NBI) 18, passed at the 2004 NEA Representative Assembly requiring that NEA conduct an analysis of \"weighted student formula\" (also known as \"student-based budgeting\") and how it impacts educational programs in large urban districts. The funding system known as \"weighted student formula\" (WSF) is a method for allocating resources to schools, and is often confused with school-based management (SBM). Both WSF and SBM are part of the broader reform effort known as \"decentralization.\" Many of the studies researched for this paper put a positive spin on WSF, but they fail to place WSF in the context of this broader decentralization effort. This failure makes analyzing WSF's impact on public schools--especially on large urban schools--difficult at best. This paper addresses this failure by first placing WSF in the context of decentralization efforts and then analyzing its impact on schools and on school programs. Appended are: (1) Comparing FTE and WSF at a Hypothetical District; and (2) Comparing WSF among Urban School Districts. (Contains 3 figures and 4 tables.)",

In response to growing state and local opposition to the law, political and professional criticisms of its requirements, and the increasing number of schools and districts identified for improvement, the administration has allowed a wide variety of changes in state accountability plans. These changes reflect a political strategy by the administration to respond to the growing state opposition to the law by providing relief from some of the law's provisions and reducing, at least temporarily, the number of schools and districts identified for improvement. But they are also a concession by ED officials that NCLB is not working and have created a policy that has no consistent meaning across states. This report documents the changes states have made to their accountability plans and examines how these policy shifts affect the meaning of  accountability and who benefits (and loses) from the changes. The authors reviewed decision letters sent to all 50 states that outlined the changes approved by ED through December 2005. The intent of this report is to provide policymakers with information they can use to develop a systemic approach to correcting the flaws in NCLB by documenting the requirements that are difficult for states to implement and identifying areas where the law may not be working as intended. The report provides an easy to understand synopsis of the changes allowed by ED and state-by-state summaries of the amendments each state adopted.

The report offers real-world evidence that providing a quality K-12 public education for all is one of the best investments that governments can make. Therefore, policymakers should engage in serious thought and analysis before taking cost-saving steps that reduce the quality of public education to solve a local, state, or even federal budget shortfall.

As one might expect in a nation as diverse as the United States--with respect to economics, geography, and politics--the level of commitment to education varies on a state-by-state basis. Regardless of these variations, improvements in public education can be measured by summary statistics. Thus, National Education Association (NEA) Research offers this report to its state and local affiliates as well as to researchers, policymakers, and the public as a tool to examine public education programs and services. Part I of this combined report--\"Rankings 2004\"--provides state-level data on an array of topics relevant to the complex enterprise of public education. Part II of this combined report--\"Estimates 2005\"--is in its 62nd year of production. This report provides projections of public school enrollment, employment and compensation of personnel, and finances, as reported by individual state departments of education.

        "description":"Recent court decisions and state studies indicate that none of the states measure up on even rough measures of adequacy and equity in school funding. Because of tax and spending limits, some states have school funding systems that are equitable, but hardly adequate. One way to address this problem is for states to get on a path toward achieving adequacy and equity by increasing education spending by a small percentage each year. However, given the  compelling need to balance state budgets, governors and legislators frequently confront the difficult choice of cutting spending or raising taxes. A major aspect of this knotty fiscal dilemma is the effect such a fiscal policy decision will have on employment levels in the state. This study employs a set of state-specific dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to evaluate the employment effects of a fiscal policy decision relating to  education-related taxing and spending. Specifically, the study looks at the consequences of an increase in education spending by 2 percent and an equal increase in state residents' consumer taxes. The analysis considers the development impacts of education as an economic &quot;industry,&quot; employing resources and producing an output. It also considers effects that are unique to educational spending, such as its role in regional amenity enhancement  (i.e., the value that the increased quality of life from better-supported schools has in attracting a productive and efficient workforce). The study finds that the number of jobs created by increasing education spending is larger than the number of jobs lost from increasing taxes to support that spending. The study reveals that such a strategy has significant net positive near- and long-term employment effects for each of the 50 states. The following are appended: (1) Education Expenditures of State and Local Governments, by State; (2) The Economic Model; and (3) Detailed Results of 50-State Analyses.

At least 90 (or around 3%) of the almost 3,000 charter schools in operation in 2004 were virtual charter schools, also referred to as cyber charter schools (Hassel &amp; Terrell, 2004), and 16 states had at least one cyber charter school in operation during the 2004-05 school year (U.S. Department of Education, n.d.). Cyber charter schools offer many benefits to the students they serve (Bogden, 2003; Cook, 2002), but without specific statutory language governing these schools, complications can arise (e.g., Pennsylvania School Boards Association v. Zogby, 2002). Indiana currently has no cyber charter schools, but proposals for their creation have been submitted to potential sponsors. During the 2005 session of the Indiana General Assembly, a charter school bill passed that in part addressed the concept of cyber charter schools. However, Indiana charter school law remains vague regarding the establishment and funding of cyber charter schools. This Education Policy Brief examines possible implications of the current law regarding cyber charter schools.

The report was explicit in its warning that the current regulatory structure of education in Indiana was not conducive to improving achievement for all students, a primary goal of a number of state and federal education initiatives, particularly the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; of 2001 (NCLB). In order to remedy this, the Subcommittee recommended  in part that the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) free schools from as much regulation as possible to allow them to focus on the pursuit of academic achievement, shift to a new role of providing support for this endeavor, and align funding to facilitate it. This Policy Brief highlights several federal and state flexibility options currently available to schools, summarizes a survey of superintendents regarding their opinions of the regulatory environment in Indiana, examines deregulatory legislation enacted in other states, and considers whether public education in Indiana would benefit from a round of deregulation. Additionally, policy perspectives are shared by representatives of the Indiana School Boards Association, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, and the Office of Governor Mitch Daniels.

        "description":"The 2004 joint annual Conference of the  National Society of Black Physicists  (NSBP) and the National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP) was held in Washington, DC during the weekend of February 18th-21st, 2004. This conference, held jointly for the first time this year, provided the over 300 African-American and Hispanic-American physics students with the unique opportunity to meet and network with working minority physicists. Also in attendance were graduate school and corporate recruiters, administrators, faculty members, and various professional society representatives. As in previous years, the Conference organizers contracted with the Statistical Research Center of the American Institute of Physics to conduct an evaluative study of the meeting. The questionnaire instrument was designed by the Statistical Research Center's staff and the Conference organizers, and structured to allow comparison with the responses of participants from the previous year. Conference participants were asked to provide information on their academic background as well as demographic characteristics. They were also asked about their physics research experience, career goals, their participation in various nationally-sponsored internships and support programs, challenges faced in their academic pursuits, and ratings of various aspects of their Conference experience. The 6-page questionnaire was distributed at the  Conference. Around 312 students attended the Conference and were given the survey to  complete. Responses were collected on the last night of the Conference, with 147 (47%)  returning completed questionnaires. (Contains 7 figures and 8 tables.)

Since the 2001-02 academic year had already begun in most schools, and since it took time for these new measures to be put in place, the first impact was on foreign students applying for entry in the Fall of 2002. Our initial survey of graduate physics departments on visa issues was conducted in January and February of 2003, and asked departments to recount the experience of the international students they had accepted the previous Fall. We heard from 75% of all US graduate physics departments, and found that visa difficulties were widespread. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Despite years of continued growth, women's participation in physics remains among the lowest of any scientific field. The issue is of great concern to many in the scientific community, spawning talks at conferences, data collection efforts, and speculation about the causes of women's low participation in physics. Although women's participation in higher education overall has now passed the 50% mark at the bachelor's level and is  approaching 50% at the PhD level, women earned just 22% of physics bachelor's degrees and 18% of physics PhDs in 2003 (a record high). Women's participation in physics is increasing, although slowly, and the rate of increase has not kept pace with other fields. One field that is notable for having a much higher representation of women is astronomy, which is closely related to physics. In spite of the relationship between the two fields, women are more highly represented in astronomy than in physics. For example, women earned 46%  of bachelor's degrees in astronomy in 2003 and 26% of PhDs in astronomy in 2003. The following are appended: (1) Number of PhD degrees earned in physics, 1972-2003; (2)Number of PhD degrees earned in astronomy, 1958-2003; and (3) High school students taking AP physics exams.

We examine whether NBPTS assesses the most effective applicants, whether certification by NBPTS serves as a signal of teacher quality, and whether completing the NBPTS assessment process serves as catalyst for increasing teacher effectiveness. We find consistent evidence that NBPTS is identifying the more effective teacher applicants and that National Board Certified Teachers are generally more effective than teachers who never applied to the program. The statistical significance and magnitude of the &quot;NBPTS effect,&quot; however, differs significantly by grade level and student type. We do not find evidence that the NBPTS certification process itself does anything to increase teacher effectiveness. Data tables are appended. (Contains 7 tables, 1 figure, and 49 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Long before the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina or the chaos of evacuation, New Orleans' social infrastructure was failing. News coverage of the overcrowded Superdome and the city's flooded streets exposed the poverty and vulnerability of many residents, especially African Americans. As New Orleans begins to rebuild, can the city avoid the mistakes of the past, instead creating more effective social support for low-income and minority residents? Innovation and experience from other U.S. cities offer promising strategies for reducing the risks of poverty and opening up opportunities for economic security and success. This essay is from an Urban Institute collection that addresses employment, affordable housing, public  schools, young children?s needs, health care, arts and culture, and vulnerable populations. All these essays assess the challenges facing New Orleans today and for years to come and recommend tested models for making the city's social infrastructure stronger and more equitable than it was before Katrina (Contains 4 notes.)",

        "description":"The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), enacted in January 2002, includes among its provisions new requirements for all employees providing instructional support (paraprofessionals, teacher aides, tutors, etc.) in programs/schools supported with Title I, Part A funds. The law stipulates that paraprofessionals or teacher aides must meet one of the following criteria:  hold an associate's degree (or higher), complete at least two years in an institution of higher education, or obtain a passing score on a test that measures reading, writing, and mathematics competency. Two problems seem likely. First, schools that employ teacher aides could lose staff unable to comply with NCLB by the 2006 deadline. Second, the preconditions for employment might prevent many traditional candidates from being hired. The loss of bilingual and other aides could exacerbate the difficulties already facing high-poverty schools, because these schools tend to rely disproportionately on the use of paraprofessionals. The research described in this document focuses on areas where these high-poverty schools are found. A survey was conducted of all states and the District of Columbia, and of a sample of urban and rural school districts. To be included in the survey population, districts had to meet three criteria: high percentage of Title I-eligible schools, high percentage of students qualifying for free and reduced lunch, and high percentage of teacher aides. Forty-four out of fifty states responded to the survey, as did 79 districts (35 urban and 44 rural). The key findings of this study are presented in this report. (Contains 2 figures and 4 notes.)

These demographic shifts are occurring alongside implementation of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, the landmark 2002 federal law that holds schools accountable for the academic performance of limited English speaking children and other groups that include many children of immigrants. This report explores how immigration is changing the profile of the nation's elementary and secondary student population during this era of reform. The report begins by describing children of immigrants and limited English proficient children. Next, it discusses children of immigrants in low-income families--another protected group under NCLB. After that, the report examines how family income and parental education interact with linguistic proficiency and isolation. Finally, the report describes characteristics of children of immigrants who fall within the major racial and ethnic reporting groups mandated under NCLB--Latino, Asian, and black students--and draws comparisons among children with parents from different countries.

Although most Americans are aware of that fact, what they often don't know, is that instead of organizing our educational systems to make things better for these children, we organize systems of public education in ways that make things worse. This report is unique among funding equity reports in looking not at overall differences between school districts but, rather, on who wins and who loses as a result of state and local financing decisions. The Funding Gap looks at the outcomes of policy choices made in every state and documents that most states continue to shortchange the districts educating the greatest numbers of poor students and students of color. Funding gaps undermine one of the  most powerful and core beliefs that Americans cling to :that no matter what circumstances children are born into, all have the opportunity to become educated citizens. This report analyzes annual financial data from each of the nation's more than 14,000 public school districts, gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Education.

        "description":"A challenge facing educators is to find ways to arrest and reverse the cumulative deficit in reading experienced by many students with learning disabilities. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a strategy intervention to increase the reading comprehension of eighth grade students with reading disabilities in intact junior high school classes (N = 98). Reading comprehension gains made by students taught a paraphrasing strategy (SIM) were compared to those of students who received conventional learning assistance (LA) and to a control group who participated in no extra intervention (No-LA). Over a year, the reading comprehension gains of students taught the paraphrasing strategy were significantly higher than those of students in LA, while attrition from the No-LA group was too high to prevent a valid comparison. Findings support the efficacy of using a strategy intervention to improve the reading comprehension of students with reading disabilities, and demonstrate that the intervention can be implemented effectively within the context of daily classroom instruction in a junior high school.

Yet far too often young people disengage from learning and do not reach their full, human potential. Community schools--places where partners come together to offer a range of supports and opportunities for children, youth, families, and communities before, during, and after school--address this need by using community-based learning to reengage students in education and to create the conditions for their success. In this report, information is presented that will help educators, community partners, policy makers, and funders consider the potential benefit to be gained from implementing community-based learning within their schools, districts, and states. The initial chapters provide an overview of the community-based learning model and its underlying theoretical basis. They describe the shared characteristics of community-based learning and connects theory to practice by exploring how these characteristics build on what we know about how young people learn. Chapter 3 summarizes the outcomes--academic, civic and moral, personal and social, and work related--of various community-based learning strategies. Chapter 4 is a call to action aimed at policymakers, advocates, and practitioners. Throughout the report, examples briefly illustrate how community-based learning engages young people--by helping them meet academic, social, and work goals--and how it improves their communities. These examples from urban, rural, and suburban communities focus on a diversity of issues, including a lack of community newspapers, obesity, a declining economy, and a burdened school system. The appendices offer more information. Appendix A reviews the theoretical foundations underlying the community-based learning model. Appendix B provides an overview of the six major community-based learning approaches chosen for their emphasis on community problem solving. Appendix C lists information about relevant organizations and resources available. (Contains 68 endnotes.)",

The research review focused on eight questions (and several subquestions) that are of particular interest and concern to policy and education leaders: (1) What kinds of pedagogical knowledge and practice are related to a teacher's effectiveness in promoting student achievement? (2) To what extent is the selectivity and rigor of teacher preparation programs associated with teaching quality and effectiveness? (3) What is the relationship between verbal ability and a teacher's effectiveness? (4) Is there empirical evidence for the validity and reliability of tests and methods frequently used in evaluating a teacher's effectiveness or quality? (5) To what extent is teaching experience associated with teaching quality and effectiveness? (6) To what extent does initial licensure and certification ensure a teacher's effectiveness? (7) What is the likely impact of raising teacher licensing and certification standards, specifically in raising cutoff scores on state-mandated tests? and (8) Is there empirical evidence of differences in the qualifications and performance of teachers prepared through traditional teacher education programs and those prepared through alternative certification programs?

        "description":"As the proceedings from a 2005 joint seminar between U.S. and United Kingdom service-learning and citizenship education experts and practitioners, this report presents information on the similar challenges both countries face in promoting and implementing political literacy and citizenship education programs. The seminar was entitled &quot;Political Literacy and Service Learning: The Role of Schools and Their Communities&quot; and was held in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 12-15, 2005. The Charleston seminar was intended to extend a discussion to examine: (1) the connections between political literacy, and service-learning; and (2) related research and assessment strategies. Seminar participants represented a wide range of expertise including classroom teachers, service-learning coordinators, researchers, policy experts, government officials, and non-profit leaders from states across the U.S. and from England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The seminar began with an opportunity to visit local schools where a variety of service-learning programs are currently being implemented. Participants had the chance to observe classes involved in projects, to hear student presentations of current work, and to ask questions of students and school personnel. A powerful, real-world perspective emphasizing the importance of education for citizenship was given by Bill Saunders from the South Carolina Citizenship Schools, drawing on the importance of Citizenship Schools in the American Civil Rights movement. The seminar was structured to allow all participants ample opportunities for exchange of American and British practices and important discussions about the status of both political literacy and service-learning in the American and British education systems. The presentations and deliberations constituting a dynamic meeting are captured in this report. (Contains 5 endnotes.) [This report was also produced by Innovations in Civic Participation.]",

          "Wetzel, James N."],
        "description":"College attrition rates are of substantial concern to policy makers and economists interested in educational attainment and earnings opportunities. This is not surprising since nationwide, almost one-third of all first-time college students fail to return for their sophomore year. There exists a substantial body of literature seeking to model this attrition using simple logit specifications to differentiate between those enrolled and those not enrolled in the particular term of interest. Results from such analyses have been used to design policy responses to reduce attrition. While this literature assumes that all attrition is permanent, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that it is not. A substantial fraction of students who leave one institution do return to some institution of higher education within a short time. If this short-term stopout behavior is different from longer-term dropout behavior, the usual analyses will confound the determinants of these two outcomes and the policy responses currently in place will be poorly targeted. Our goal is to determine whether this is indeed a problem, whether the factors associated with stopout behavior are statistically different from the factors associated with dropout behavior. By providing a more realistic description of attrition, this paper makes a substantial contribution to the college enrollment literature. We explicitly recognize that there are two possible types of withdrawals: short-term stopout and long-term dropout. We use longitudinal data from the 1990 Beginning Postsecondary Survey to differentiate amongst those students who remain continuously enrolled through the first calendar year, those who stop out for a short period of time, and those who stay out on a long-term basis. Most importantly, we use a multinomial logit specification to model these three outcomes. This specification allows us to test whether the factors associated with stopout behavior are statistically different from the factors associated with dropout behavior. If they are not, then the standard approach to attrition analysis is appropriate. If they are, the approach tested here will provide a more accurate picture of attrition and will better predict enrollment behavior. This analysis can then help to better identify at-risk populations and design intervention programs. (Contains 5 tables and 10 footnotes.)",

In addition to the motive for reviewing HEA doctoral degree programs, the larger study examined issues ranging from the guidelines, coordination, and communication processes used to review HEA doctoral curricula, to the impact of program evaluation on the programs. The larger study also explored factors that promote or hinder the ability of faculty and administrators to use review outcomes to effect change in HEA doctoral degree programs. The results of the study established that faculty and administrators are deeply involved in HEA doctoral degree programs and review them to improve, justify, or reallocate their resources. The findings of this research also indicated that program reviews could save HEA programs from discontinuation as well as protect their resources.",

          "Cahill, John"],
        "description":"This study examines the association between three outcomes of the freshman and sophomore years (retention, academic achievement and student rating of instruction) and the amount of exposure to three types of instructors (regular full-time faculty, adjunct faculty and graduate teaching assistants). The growing reliance in higher education on instructors who are not part of the permanent, full-time workforce that has traditionally constituted the professoriate is well documented. Since 1981, the number of part-time faculty employed by colleges and universities has grown by 79 percent, while the share of faculty hired on the traditional tenure track has grown at a much lower rate (Anderson, 2002). According to a report by the Coalition on the Academic Workforce (as cited in Cox, 2000) non-tenure track faculty make up almost half of the teaching staff in many humanities &amp; social science disciplines. Generally, studies have focused on the direct relationships between exposure to adjunct faculty and student outcomes, without taking into effect the background characteristics and other enrollment experiences that may affect these outcomes. The present study attempts to remedy that knowledge gap by modeling student outcomes as a function of exposure to different instructor types while controlling first for variables known to be associated with these outcomes. In this study, part-time faculty will be referred to as &quot;adjuncts.&quot; Adjuncts' employment may be long or short-term, but is paid on a part-time contract outside of the regular faculty pay plan. Full-time instructors and lecturers on multi-year contracts but not on tenure-earning lines are included here with the regular, full-time &quot;faculty members.&quot;",

Yet previous studies about the experience of student-athletes show that participation in intercollegiate sports has little influence on desirable outcomes of college. This study compares the engagement of student-athletes with those of non-athletes in effective educational practices. Contrary to many reports in the popular media, the findings from this study indicate that, on balance, student-athletes across a large number of colleges and universities do not differ greatly from their peers in terms of their participation in effective educational practices. In most instances, when differences do exist, they favor athletes. (Contains 6 tables and 1 appendix.)",

        "author":["Kelly, Wayne",
          "Shale, Doug"],
        "description":"As tuition fees increase, universities need to be concerned whether costs have risen to a point where students from low-income families are being disproportionately excluded. Given the rates of increases in tuition fees in recent times, this outcome seems plausible and is often the opening point of discussions on this matter (see for example, the position of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, 2002, cited below). However, trends in university enrollments relative to trends in tuition fees would suggest otherwise. Consequently, we take as our starting point a review of what the existing studies have to say in this regard. We next review available data pertaining to the question of whether observed enrollment growth is attributable to increases in the proportion of high SES students. We found that the methodologies used and the time periods encompassed differ to an extent that the generalisability of the results necessarily need be constrained. The implication from our point of view is that we cannot be certain what the answer to the question would be for  our University. Therefore, we devised a study using a novel methodology based on a national census data base and students' zip codes to develop indicators of socio-economic status for individual students. For reasons we elaborate on later in the paper, we restrict our attention to entering high school graduates (freshmen)--and to general arts and science bachelors programs. The study compares results from the University of Calgary freshmen cohorts of 1991 and 2002 to assess whether the socio-economic mix of the student body has changed and if this change might be due to increases in tuition fees. Our methodology has a number of advantages over the available alternatives. We do not need to rely on surveying students (with the attendant problems of cost, comprehensiveness and unreliability of student-reports of family circumstances). We are also able to use multiple indicators reflective of socio-economic status rather than relying on a single index. The results of our study indicate that the freshmen students in 2002 come from family circumstances that are (significantly) socio-economically better than those of the freshmen cohort entering in 1991 (which was prior to a period of substantial increases in tuition fees at the University of Calgary).

Using multi-year cohorts at a public research university with a liberal undergraduate admissions policy, results confirm the importance of including first-year math experience, level of academic challenge in major, concurrent enrollment, and second-year financial aid offers when measuring freshmen retention. The positive impact of a large-scale scholarship program in widening access and evening out retention across income background must be balanced against findings that show academic performance and readiness to take on and pass difficult subject matter to be more important in explaining new freshmen dropout and transfer-out during both first and second semesters. Similarly, examining the influence of changing financial aid support between the first and second semester yields additional insight into why students progress to the second year. Specifically, middle-income students with greater levels of unmet need face an elevated departure risk, while academically well-prepared freshmen with unmet need are more likely to transfer to other institutions.

This increased attention represents a shift from the more traditional \"resource and reputation\" model of academic quality to a model that emphasizes institutional best practices and student experiences that enhance student learning and development. At the same time, institutions and the public face rising operating costs of costs of attendance. However, relatively little effort has been made to explore the potential relationship between these two important research and policy areas. This study examined the relationship between institutional expenditures and student engagement based on data from 142 colleges and universities. The results of an OLS multiple regression model, including a factor for student engagement as the dependent variable, suggest that administrative expenditures are negatively related to student engagement. These results support further exploration of potential complex causal links between expenditures and engagement and may provide support for initiatives to reverse historical trends and adjust institutional spending.

The Personal Resilience Questionnaire and the Michigan International Student Problem Inventory were used in this study. All together 289 unusable responses were gathered from two universities. Correlation studies, t-tests, One-way ANOVA, and Tukey analyses were used. Statistical analyses revealed that: resilience characteristics were moderately correlated with background factors, highly negatively correlated with adjustment problem areas, and better correlated with adjustment problem areas than were background factors.

Using principles in data mining, the study followed a proven data mining process that proceeded from identifying the research questions, to staging the data, to data auditing, and to building scenarios. All scenarios were subjected to data visualization, and in cases appropriate, Chi-square analysis. This study established 6 typologies of students enrolled at a suburban community college. The study is based on the notion that student behavioral data are good candidates for new facets of research studies, compared to using non-behavioral data, such as gender or race. The discoveries from this study emerged as both meaningful for understanding and measuring students' learning as well as actionable for decision making.

        "description":"Scholarship aid continues to be crucially important in attracting and retaining students in higher education institutions (Abrahamson & Hossler, 1990; Cabrera, Nora, & Castaneda, 1992; Paulsen & St. John, 1997; Schuh, 2000; St. John, 1992; St. John et al., 1994; Terkla, 1985). Although the general concept and effect of financial assistance is complex, the impact of scholarship aid on college selection and student persistence is significant (Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991; Schuh, 2000; Somers, 1995; St. John et al., 2000; Wilcox, 1991). Strategy in scholarship policy development and the impact of aid policy are subjects worthy of increasing attention at the individual institutional level (Schuh, 2000; Somers, 1996), and the collaborative work of institutional researchers with financial aid and admissions personnel can produce important information for guiding key institutional decisions about financial aid policy (Voorhees, 1997). Institutional researchers can help their institutions to maximize the impact of available scholarship funds, helping both the students and the institution overall in the most effective way. An ongoing study of scholarship offers and matriculation at a public university revealed notable results, with implications for immediate adjustment of scholarship policy and practice, and helping the institution to begin to improve the management of its vitally important scholarship funds. Scholarship management research is an increasingly important realm of study for institutional researchers, and scholarship yield analysis is an area in which the institution can achieve practical results with a reasonably clear application. The purpose of this paper is to introduce scholarship yield analysis and to provide example information and illustrations to help institutional researchers consider undertaking this type of scholarship management research at their respective institutions.

        "description":"Although recent results from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) suggest there is considerable variation in levels of undergraduate student engagement within Carnegie institutional classifications, research also suggests different classifications of institutions exhibit different types (Pike and Kuh, 2005) and levels (Pike, Kuh and Gonyea, 2003) of student engagement. However, an important question that requires additional examination is the potential relationship between particular engagement variables and various outcomes of interest to students and institutions. Given the time and resource limitations that faculty, staff, and administrators face in their efforts to improve academic quality, analyses that move beyond norm-based or statistical comparisons and test empirical relationships within theory-based models of quality in undergraduate education may provide a more effective means to focus improvement efforts. This study examines student-reported learning and development factor scores, the likelihood of persistence, and students' ratings of their overall educational experience based on NSSE responses from over 1,500 first-year and senior students in 2004 at a large, research-extensive university. Using Chickering and Gamson's (1987) &quot;Seven Principles for Effective Practice in Undergraduate Education&quot; as a conceptual framework to guide variable selection, the results of four models suggest that a high level of academic challenge, institutional emphasis on academic work and studying, and prompt feedback on academic performance may provide the most productive avenues for enhancing the impact and quality of undergraduate education at large, research-extensive universities. Possible explanations and potential implications of these and other findings for students, faculty members, institutional leaders, policymakers, and accrediting bodies are discussed.

        "description":"Equity in faculty salaries has always been a controversial issue facing institutions of higher education. As a bastion of academic freedom where faculty and students purse knowledge, it is almost anti-intellectual to find a gender gap in salaries. More importantly, there are laws, which ensure gender equity in salaries. Thus, salary equity has evolved from a moral issue to a legal issue. A judicial salary decision has become all the more important when faculty discrimination can be brought to court. In order to fend off any legal challenges in court, an institution of higher education has to first decide whether or not there is a salary disparity among faculty on campus. There are various ways of pursuing this inquiry. First, descriptive statistics are informative, yet they lack inferential power. Then, the use of inferential statistics such as regression analysis provides more probative values yet poses some difficult statistical problems. The nature of these statistical problems is rather different if one views it statistically or substantially. The purpose of this paper is to discuss some major statistical issues involved in the court system, and to explore solutions to such problems. Actual data was used in presenting the problems and solutions. (Contains 5 tables.)",

To examine possible factors related to predicted GPA, linear regression models were developed for each year 1984-2004. (Years 1974-1983 were not included due to missing data.) Regression analyses found SAT and receipt of the HOPE scholarship, gender, race, and college of major to play a role in predicted GPA, and contributions of some of these variables varied widely over the 21-year period. While preliminary findings indicate the contributing nature of these variables to the change in GPA, the adjusted R square values are relatively low.

Final transportation routes from all six districts to the centrally located county Middle and High Schools are included and explained. Both elementary district and entire county algorithms are included. First, the population distribution was analyzed and bus stops were created for the sample Laurel district such that the average number of children per stop is maximized and each child walks no more than a predetermined distance. Next, the bus stops were grouped geographically into regions of roughly equivalent number of students, and the viable routes for each region were determined. Finally, these routes were sequenced by the implementation of the NCL (No Child Left at Bus Stop) algorithm created for the Madison County Schools. The algorithm has been created so that changes can be made to accommodate adjustments in parent and school board decisions.",

        "description":"Between November 2004, and March 2005, the Center for Civic Education conducted a survey of alumni from the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program. Altogether, 522 alumni responded, ranging in age from 18-34. The primary focus of the study was on voting and other forms of political engagement. Due to self-selection by respondents, these findings should be considered as suggestive rather than generalizable to all We the People alumni. We the People alumni were compared with a national probability study from the 2004 \"National Election Studies\" (NES) of other young Americans their age. In other questions, alumni were also compared with over 289,000 American college freshmen (\"The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 2004\"). Among alumni eligible to vote in 2004, key findings are: (1) 92% of alumni reported voting in November 2000, in contrast to 78% of those surveyed in the NES study; (2) 85% of alumni said they had voted in all previous elections; (3) 63% reported being very interested in national politics and national affairs; (4) 60% of alumni discussed national politics and affairs every day or nearly every day; and (5) 58% of alumni felt becoming a community leader was essential or very important, in contrast to 31% of college freshmen. In summary, We the People alumni surveyed are better informed and more politically engaged than their peers. (Contains 7 endnotes.)",

The central hypothesis thereby being that such an engagement would transform the ability and willingness of participants to engage their own students with the material they present in their classrooms. This hypothesis is premised on a core constructivist principle and includes elements of holistic learning strategies coming out of the field of cognitive psychology and neurobiology. A secondary, but equally important, aspect of the program was the establishment of a partnership between teachers from across the country, both to build an element of mutual cooperation between participants and to encourage the possibility of a series of domestic teacher exchanges after the seminar.

        "description":"We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution is an educational program developed by the Center for Civic Education (the Center). The program instructs students on the history and principles of American constitutional democracy with the primary goal of promoting civic competence and responsibility among the nation's elementary, middle, and secondary students. Additionally, the instructional program is intended to enhance students' understanding of the institutions of American constitutional democracy and to reinforce the contemporary relevance of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The program utilizes highly acclaimed curricular materials developed by the Center. At the high school level, classes can choose to enter a formal competition, advancing from congressional district and state competitions to national finals. The competition is structured as a simulated congressional hearing in which students' knowledge of the Constitution and American democratic institutions is tested, allowing students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they have acquired through the curriculum and to strengthen their analytical skills in a practical way. In the spring of 2005, a survey was given to students participating in the national finals competition of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution (We the People) Program to assess its impact at the highest level on student knowledge of and support for democratic institutions and processes. This report compares the scores and responses of We the People national finalists to the relevant national sample.",

All have managed to place and keep between half and about two-thirds of the low-skilled individuals who entered their programs into jobs for over a year. Although several other JI programs have shown early promise with small populations, these programs all have achieved some level of scale and shown impressive retention rates for participants. All told, the Jobs Initiative has supported more than 40 jobs projects, accounting for over 9,500 placements and an overall 12-month retention rate of more than 54 percent. (Contains 3 footnotes.)",

However, a key step that is regularly overlooked in predicting or evaluating the performance of a board is the appointment of its trustees. To begin to address this fundamental &quot;first step&quot; this guide focuses on criteria to be used in the selection of members for public boards of trustees. These findings have been based on 132 interviews with leaders in higher education. Two sets of criteria are essential: one for individual nominees, which will be discussed first; and the second for the board as a whole. Just as nominees to the Supreme Court are judged by the American Bar Association according to specific criteria, so too, should nominees to public boards be evaluated in terms of established standards. Accordingly, the guidelines that follow are intended to serve as minimum requirements for the appointment of new board members to either single or multiple institutions.

The implied bargain America offers its citizens is supposed to be that anyone who works hard and plays by the rules can support his or her family and move onward and upward. But for millions of New Yorkers, that bargain is out of reach; the uphill climb faced by earlier generations has become a sheer vertical wall. At the heart of this report, under all the facts, figures and policy analysis is a consistent theme: New York needs to prioritize the issue of the working poor and it needs to do so in a new way. New York currently focuses on &quot;making work pay&quot; by providing subsidized supports such as food stamps and tax breaks to low-income workers. State officials deserve credit for these choices, and the authors of this report want to be clear that these policies are desperately needed by low-income New Yorkers and must be continued and in many cases improved.

        "description":"New York City has for far too long tolerated a severe imbalance in the delivery of legal services in child welfare cases. Although the Administration for Children's Services (ACS), the Legal Aid Society and Lawyers for Children all are given a significant annual budget which allows these agencies to represent petitioners and children in Family Court, parents have never had an  institutional legal provider. This unacceptable imbalance has unfairly served vulnerable families. Parents are deprived of attorneys who have supportive resources, such as investigators, social workers, paralegals and professional development programs. As the articles in this issue of &quot;Child Welfare Watch&quot; describe, the city's troubled Family Court has been in the midst of a reform process for several years climaxing in the new Permanency Law signed by Governor George Pataki last year. While the Permanency Law streamlines the case process and provides for better sharing of information with parents and their attorneys, it does not solve the far more difficult problem of inadequate government investment in the operations of Family Court, all of which is documented in theme and first article of this issue, &quot;A Matter of Judgement: Deciding the Future of Family Court in NYC&quot; (Andrew White). Other articles contained in this issue include: (1) Recommendations and Solutions (proposed by Child Welfare Watch); (2) Failing Children: How Schools Can Intervene (Daliz Perez with Andrew White); (3) Before the Crisis: A Snapshot of the NYC System; (4) Juvenile Arrests Soar: Delinquents Flood Courts (Alyssa Katz); (5) Order in the Court: Reforms Move Families Forward (Alyssa Katz); (6) Meet the New Law; (7) How a Case Proceeds; (8) Prosecutors &quot;New&quot; Case: ACS Reinvents Its Legal Team (Cassi Feldman); (9) Remembering Julius C.C.

Unfortunately, indications are that New York is drifting farther from that vision as time goes by. The jobs being created here generally pay less than those lost to other communities. The long decline of small cities and towns across the Empire State continues as the best and brightest of those communities relocate elsewhere. And the nation's own capacity to resist these trends through public programs that help working families to increase their earning power and stabilize their finances is undermined by budget cutters at both the federal and state levels. This new report reveals that the number of working poor families in the state has continued to rise in recent years. (Contains 5 tables and 29 endnotes.)

        "description":"Since 1998, federally funded One-Stop Service Centers around the country have focused primarily on assisting the unemployed into work. WASC tests a strategy that expands that mission by targeting people who are already working, but at low wages. Through career coaching, skills training, and better connections with employers - and led by a newly integrated team of workforce and welfare professionals housed at the One-Stop--the program strives to help these workers stay employed, build their skills, and advance. At the same time, WASC makes it easier for busy working people to take up existing public financial work supports--a &quot;make work pay&quot; strategy that other research suggests will also help stabilize their employment. But WASC's longer-term goal is more ambitious: to enable these workers to climb career ladders so they will have less need for income supplements to support their families in the future. The program also intends to help employers reduce costly turnover and fill second- and third-rung positions that require more skills than do entry-level slots. This report examines the beginning efforts of two WASC sites to institute these reforms by bridging the divide between the workforce and welfare systems, which typically function in separate silos. Future reports will explain whether they--and other WASC sites--prove successful in implementing the full program vision and improving workers' skills, jobs, and income.

The User's Guide was prepared by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the technical report was prepared by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS). These documents analyze 132 OCR complaints and compliance reviews involving 130 colleges and universities from 1992 to 2002. They discuss the effective and problematic elements of 52 survey instruments used in OCR cases and five survey instruments used by other institutions. Based on that analysis, the User's Guide provides a prototype survey (&quot;Model Survey&quot;) to measure student interest under part three. The User's Guide summarizes the information in the technical report that is most relevant to the practical concerns of institutions considering the use of a survey. The technical report provides the statistical analysis that is the basis for the User's Guide and Model Survey. This combined document is designed specifically for intercollegiate athletics. However, these general principles will often apply to club, intramural, and interscholastic athletic programs, which are also covered by the Title IX implementing regulation.",

It builds upon an earlier twelve-state report by examining public investment in nine additional states and the District of Columbia. This part describes overall per child investments in education and development. Next, the report summarizes the research literature on what has been proven effective in improving children's education and development in the early years of life. Then, the report estimates what it would mean to make investments in these evidenced-based programs to reach the young children who would benefit from them. The report concludes with a discussion of the implications for making such investments, drawing again from a growing body of economic studies on the cost benefits of such investments.

        "author":["Walsh, Catherine B."],
        "description":"&quot;School Readiness Indicators: Making Progress for Young Children&quot; was a multi-state initiative that used child well-being indicators to build a change agenda in states and local communities in order to improve school readiness and ensure early school success. The central premise behind this initiative was that top-notch school readiness indicator systems at the state and local levels can be used to build support for early childhood investments. The task of the 17 participating states was to develop a comprehensive set of school readiness indicators from birth through third grade. The attention to tracking state level outcomes for the youngest children was a unique focus of the initiative's work. The 17 states involved in the initiative assembled teams comprised of government leaders, child advocates, and researchers to accomplish the following objectives: (1) create a set of measurable indicators related to and defining school readiness that can be tracked regularly over time at the state and local levels; (2) have states and local governments adopt this indicators-based definition of school readiness, fill in the gaps in data availability, track data over time, and report findings to their citizens; and (3) stimulate policy, program, and other actions to improve the ability of all children to read at grade level by the end of third grade. This paper discusses how states participating in this ground breaking initiative understood the importance of addressing the comprehensive nature of school readiness. It also provides examples of the many ways states have used their school readiness indicators to change policy on behalf of young children and their families. [This brief was produced by Voices for America's Children. The 17 State School Readiness Indicators Initiative was sponsored by the David and  Lucile Packard, Kauffman, and Ford Foundations and managed by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT. This paper is based on the work of the School Readiness Indicator Teams in each of the 17 states.]",

In recent years, economists have become more interested than ever before in the impact of early investments in children on the future health of the economy. And scientists are giving them the data they need to understand why these early years matter, and why policies that focus on the years leading up to formal schooling may, in fact, be one of the most important investments a society can make in itself. This brief explores the new thinking behind a cluster of policies called \"school readiness\" that attempt to ensure the healthy development of children who, in turn, can take their place in communities and the workforce and give back to the society.

These are just a few of the compelling questions addressed in &quot;EE Certification: Making Best Practice Standard Practice,&quot; a new article exploring advancements and challenges in state and national EE certification. A growing trend in almost every profession, certification offers a way to assure that professionals in the field meet certain minimum standards and experience. It provides legitimacy for the individual and for the field. Several states, supported by the North American Association for Environmental Education, have thus far established certification programs based on NAAEE's Guidelines for the Preparation and Professional Development of Environmental Educators. The approaches within the four states vary widely, with different methods for demonstrating competency in required areas: environmental literacy, history, professional requirements, planning and implementation, and assessment and evaluation. Even seasoned professionals are seeking certification and finding the process valuable. Says Cheryl Stanco, Project Learning Tree Co-Coordinator at the Texas Forestry Association, &quot;I've been [in the field] for 19 years.

What are the roots of the field? As with a tree, the roots of environmental education are widespread and diverse. They provide support for the present field while supplying the nourishment for future growth. Does environmental education owe its origins to the  influence of philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) who felt that education should maintain a focus on the environment, or to educators such as Louis Agassiz  (1807-1873) who encouraged students to &quot;study nature, not books&quot;?

These small schools are part of the Department of Education's efforts to create more choices for thousands of students like you so that you can succeed as citizens of New York City. Nearly 50 of the schools described in this Guide are new. They have been created by over 225 different organizations, including New Visions for Public Schools, the Asia Society, City University of New York, The College Board, The Institute for Student Achievement, International Partnership Schools, the New York City Outward Bound Center, Replications and The Urban Assembly. What is special about these small schools? Most enroll 500 or fewer students. Like large high schools, small schools work to ensure that students are able to graduate from high school. Small schools are places where the principal and teachers know students and their family by name. They provide rigorous, Regents-level curricula and enable students to meet state requirements. But each small school is unique because it is designed around a theme or set of activities. This academic focus complements the traditional high school curricula by building on students own interests and strengths and striving to be relevant to their life and dreams.

The Commission's most recent eligibility study showed that the percentage of African American high school graduates who met the minimum admission requirements of the University of California more than doubled between 1996 and 2003. The eligibility rate for Latinos also increased sharply. These gains are a very welcome development, but eligibility in itself is not a complete measure of access to public universities. The desired outcome of efforts to broaden access is that students from all ethnic back-grounds are actually entering and completing degrees at public universities. However, recent gains in eligibility have not been matched by gains in enrollments at UC and CSU. (Contains 2 tables and 9 graphs.)",

        "description":"This survey represents a preliminary step toward demonstrating the diversity of motivations  and circumstances that characterize cultural participation. This report examines only live attendance. The evidence presented in this report indicates the pressing need for additional analyses that make diversity a central facet of examining other dimensions of participation.   The phone survey of a random sample of Americans age 18 and older was conducted  during June and July 2004. The 1,231 people who participated represent a response rate of 45 percent. The study built on and extended an earlier survey of arts participation in five  local communities conducted by the Urban Institute in 1998, also commissioned by the  Wallace Foundation. The primary innovation of the present survey was that it includes questions about respondents' most recently attended cultural event. This information allowed the researchers to link specific types of motivations, experiences, and venues to attendance at different types of events, and thus compare their commonalities and differences. After summarizing respondents' overall attendance during the previous 12 months, this report focuses primarily on that section of the survey. In doing so, motivations and experiences surrounding cultural participation are also discussed. Likewise, attention is given to attendance at different types of music events to supplement current information. These analyses argue for recognizing the diversity of cultural participation, even within disciplines. Survey Questions: Paper Conversion of the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview Instrument is appended. (Contains 10 exhibits.)

Although this is welcome news, eligibility rates do not tell the full story about access to a university education. Because a lower proportion of African American and Latino ninth-graders complete high school and graduate, the gap in access to a university education is wider than indicated by eligibility rates based on high school graduates. The eligibility gap is particularly wide for male students. Despite recent gains, eligibility rates for African Americans and Latinos are well below the rates for Whites and Asians. Only about 6 percent of African Americans and Latino high school graduates are eligible for the University of California, compared with 16 percent of White graduates and 31 percent of Asian graduates. Eligibility rates are defined as the percentage of California public high school graduates meeting the minimum requirements for admission to the University of California and the California State University.

        "description":"Civic education conducted in schools plays a significant role in fostering citizenship but teaching about these themes is often incorporated in history or social studies courses and not found in a distinct subject. An essential part of improving civic learning opportunities for students is preparing teachers more adequately for civic-related subjects, but there is little consensus about what that preparation should entail. At least three dimensions of teachers' preparation have been identified as important: teachers' content knowledge, teacher's pedagogical content knowledge, and teachers' beliefs (for example, their sense of confidence in teaching the subject matter). A lack of empirical research linking teachers' knowledge and beliefs with the achievement and engagement of their students stands in the way of charting a clear direction for improving teacher education in civic-related subjects. The IEA Civic Education Study7, which collected data in 1999, surveyed approximately 200  civic-related teachers in each of twenty-seven countries in conjunction with the testing of 14-year olds. In each school where students were tested three teachers were identified who taught subjects covered in the students' test of civic knowledge (subjects such as government, national history, social studies, and social sciences). While it was preferred that the teachers sampled could be linked to the class of students who participated in the survey (i.e., they taught these students), other teachers of civic-related disciplines were surveyed if one or more teachers could not be linked to the tested class. Once teachers were identified, they were administered a survey about their teaching background and methods, their experience and confidence in teaching various civic-related topics, and their attitudes towards civic education at school. Unlike previous research, it was possible to link these teachers to the class they taught in many of these countries including the United States. This fact sheet first examines how teachers responded to questions about their professional development, confidence in teaching, and attitudes towards civic education. Profiles contrasting the teachers' patterns in countries where students performed at different levels on the test of civic knowledge were drawn. Second, within two of the higher performing countries, United States and Finland, how teachers' educational experience relates to students' civic achievement and civic engagement (likelihood of voting) is explored.

        "author":["Talcott, William"],
        "description":"The historical study of university campuses can tell us much about the changing character and presuppositions of citizenship. Likewise, the study of citizenship can shed considerable light on the nature of universities. Throughout American history, various elite institutions can be seen struggling to establish a semblance of order and control in political society-most clearly in the late 19th century with large numbers of immigrants changing the urban landscape, and with populist movements threatening elite cultural and political dominance, but equally in the face of early 20th century phenomena of mass society, propaganda, and global interdependence. The author finds it helpful to think of modern universities, emerging in the late 19th century, as right there in the struggle, as new institutional arenas of public practice to shape new kinds of citizens. From this perspective, universities and modern citizenship are intertwined in ways mutually complicating and obscuring. With the aim of untangling some of these connections, this review covers a sample of formative texts on the broad topic of citizenship and the historical development of modern universities in the United States.

        "description":"This study unearths and examines rich models of learning in which multiple institutions collaboratively play a role in promoting civic education. Using historical and ethnographic case study analysis, this paper addresses the research question: What is the role of community in civic education? Specifically, the author examines Hull House and the pioneering social settlement work of Jane Addams at the turn of the 20th century; democratic education for social change put into practice during the civil rights movement by Myles Horton, Septima Clark, Bernice Robinson, and others at the Highlander Folk School; and the Neighborhood Learning Community in St. Paul, Minnesota, a network of community institutions, schools, and higher education institutions which applies the lessons from Hull House and Highlander in its efforts to create a neighborhood culture of learning. Short overviews of these cases are given, as well as detailed lessons for the role of community in civic education. The cases in this study present important historical and contemporary models where educators commit to making change over longer periods of time; place a deliberate emphasis on comprehensive, relational, and public education; make learning relevant to people's everyday lives; recognize the creative powers of diversity through public work; utilize the talents and instincts of non-professionals; foster reciprocal relationships; and embrace flexibility and trust in the messiness of democracy.

Boys and girls play in sports as varied as swimming, baseball, soccer, wrestling, and field hockey. The great majority participate in \"recreational\" leagues in which teams enroll all-comers, compete against local counterparts, and honor the norm \"everyone gets to play.\" The lessons a child takes from his sports involvement-lessons about sportsmanship, fair play, and competition-are shaped in large measure by parental attitudes and behavior. A good deal of attention by sports organizers and scholars focuses on the effect of coaches on young players' attitudes, and justifiably so, but evidence suggests that a player's family has the greatest influence on his views, and within the family, parents are more influential than siblings.

With more support, it can also represent a second chance for youth to develop civic knowledge and skills and lifelong patterns of civic engagement. The aim of this study is to lead to further collaborations between policymakers and adult literacy educators. Prior to the  research performed in this study, no national study of the civics education and civic engagement practices of this group of young learners had been undertaken. To begin to map this terrain, CIRCLE asked staff in the Literacy and Lifelong Learning Program at SRI International to conduct a literature review and initial survey of adult literacy programs that serve youth and offer some form of civics-related education or civic engagement activities. After presenting the findings of the review and survey, the report draws on the findings, as well as on the recommendations of The Civic Mission of Schools, to suggest key areas where further work by practitioners, researchers, and policymakers is most needed.

        "description":"This research assumes a relatively stable lifeworld for young people. For example,  it assumes that the meaning of volunteering or service is sufficiently similar across multiple contexts to remain a valid and stable indicator. By extension, it also assumes that the lifeworld of young people today is not undergoing a period of rapid, and perhaps even radical, change. This research began with the assumption that it is possible that a series of structural and environmental changes in the lives of young people had occurred in the past ten years or so that were sufficiently strong to have reconfigured the civic ecology, the overall environment in which young people are socialized into civic life. The hope was to reconstruct this ecology on a community wide scale. It was the intention to reconstruct the most significant networks and institutions that shaped the lives of young people as an environment in a single community, Madison, Wisconsin. The hope was further to purposively sample across these multiple networks, in order to demonstrate in some depth the quality of connection and disconnection of young people to these networks, and further, to gauge the meanings that young people themselves ascribed to these attachments. This goal was partially successful. A systematically stratified purposive sampling frame (described in this paper) that allowed identification and interviews of a very diverse group of almost 100 young people in many different contexts of their lives, ranging from the most formal institutions of school, across multiple semi-formal contexts of civic youth organizations, clubs, and volunteer settings, to informal contexts of association was constructed. Put simply, young people?s civic activities and attitudes were greatly shaped by three broad processes: (1) First, family socialization was still a prime determinant of what kinds of activities young  people would engage in and why they would do so; (2) Second, the institutional setting of school ined primary context that organized these activities and channeled them in a variety of directions, supplemented in important ways by after-school settings and clubs, service, and volunteer activities; and (3) Finally, the future expectations of young people had a much stronger force in shaping what kinds of activities they engaged in and why than had been expected. Specifically, the role of college loomed larger in the lives of many of the young people and this was true across class and racial backgrounds. Many young people told us that one important reason for their civic engagement was the desire to build a resume for college admission, or in their own words, &quot;resume-padding.&quot; And this was so whether they were oriented toward an Ivy League school, state university, or even the local technical college. Almost all of the young people interviewed expected (or at least hoped) to better their lives and linked these expectations to college education, and a majority linked their hopes for college admission to service.

As tuition costs increase and as schooling option burgeon, today's youth are taking longer to finish their academic programs and are increasingly working as they do so. To learn more about the intersection of education, work and political participation, this paper reports data from a phone survey of over 1,000 19-23 year olds on (1) their schooling and work paths and (2) the political resources, opportunities and participation levels for three categories of young people: college  students, working students, and non-college (working) youth. The data show that the most common path for this age group is that of the student worker. The data also show that these student workers report higher levels of political interest, political skills, political mobilization and political participation than their college student and working youth peers. This report suggests that there may be civic correlates to a schooling and work schedule as well as conceptual benefits to examining the education variable in tandem with other measurements that describe the contemporary youth experience. Appended is: Measurement of Schooling and Work Education. (Contains 5 endnotes and 4 tables.)

This paper, commissioned by the Brookings Institution, studies the emergence of the mixed delivery model, in which pre-kindergarten is delivered in community-based settings and schools. It describes findings of a state survey CLASP conducted to understand the policy choices, opportunities, and challenges of including community-based child care providers in pre-kindergarten programs. At the conclusion of the study period for this paper (November 2004), at least 29 states that are currently operating at least one pre-kindergarten program using a mixed delivery approach were found. Those states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Other states, for example Florida, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, are considering or expanding pre-kindergarten policies but were not yet established enough to be included in our study. This policy brief describes principal approaches to state implementation of the mixed delivery model but does not provide examples of state policies. (Contains 1 figure.)",

While each bill is designed to improve the quality of Head Start programs by requiring an increase in the number of teachers with a bachelor's degree or higher, there are important differences in the two proposals. CLASP's analysis demonstrates that it will cost at least $2.7 billion over six years to cover the cost of educating the necessary number of teachers in the House bill and raising their compensation to the levels of kindergarten teachers. To pay for the cost of the Senate requirements for increased education and raising compensation, CLASP estimates that it will cost as much as $3.4 billion over six years. These estimates include the cost of tuition and  books, substitutes and raising Head Start salaries so that those teachers with bachelor's degrees were earning salaries comparable to kindergarten teachers with the same levels of education in their states or nationally.

This mix of services, in turn, helps to address the needs of children with disabilities and their families while helping prepare children for school.

They conducted analyses of statewide teacher data to follow trends in teacher distribution over time and to document changes in California's teacher development policies and programs. They also collected original data in four teacher labor markets, visiting multiple districts in the same geographical region that draw on a common pool of teachers. In a total of 10 districts, they interviewed district officials, school administrators, and other school site leaders to determine how access to and use of available labor market data, formal policies (e.g., collective bargaining agreements, salary schedules), and practices (e.g., working conditions, instructional support) affect the hiring, distribution, and assignment of teachers at both the district and school levels. In addition, they interviewed teachers to learn how they chose their district and school and received their teaching assignments, and what kind of instructional supports are available to them. They also examined key contextual factors in each site, including local responses to the Williams settlement and the impact of NCLB on hiring and assignment practices. Lastly, They reviewed collective bargaining agreements (from the 10 case study districts and 7 of the 10 largest districts in the state) and interviewed union leaders in the case study districts to understand transfer and assignment policies. The findings from these data collection efforts are the basis for this report.

        "description":"According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, nearly 4 in 10 fourth graders read below the basic level. These literacy problems get worse as students advance through school and are exposed to progressively more complex concepts and courses. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of four remedial reading programs in improving the reading skills of 3rd and 5th graders, whether the impacts of the programs vary across students with difference baseline characteristics, and to what extent can this instruction close the reading gap and bring struggling readers within the normal range--relative to the instruction normally provided by their schools. The study took place in elementary schools in 27 districts of the Allegheny Intermediate Unit outside Pittsburgh, PA during the 2003-04 school year. Within each of 50 schools, 3rd and 5th grade students were identified as struggling readers by their teachers. These students were tested and were eligible for the study if they scored at or below the 30th percentile on a word-level reading test and at or above the 5th percentile on a vocabulary test. The final sample contains a total of 742 students. There are 335 3rd graders ? 208 treatment and 127 control students. There are 407 5th graders ? 228 treatment and 179 control students. Four existing programs were used: Spell Read P.A.T., Corrective Reading, Wilson Reading, and Failure Free Reading. Corrective Reading and Wilson Reading were modified to focus only on word-level skills. Spell Read P.A.T. and Failure Free Reading were intended to focus equally on word-level skills and reading comprehension/vocabulary. Teachers received 70 hours of professional development and support during the year. Instruction was delivered in small groups of 3 students, 5 days a week, for a total of 90 hours. Seven measures of reading skill were administered at the beginning and end of the school year to assess student progress: Word Attack, Word Identification Comprehension (Woodcock Reading Mastery Test); Phonemic Decoding Efficiency and Sight Word Efficiency (Test of Word Reading Efficiency); Oral Reading Fluency (Edformation); and Passage Comprehension (Group Reading Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation). After one year of instruction, there were significant impacts on phonemic decoding, word reading accuracy and fluency, and comprehension for 3rd graders, but not for 5th graders. For third graders in the reading programs, the gap in word attach skills between struggling readers and average readers was reduced by about two-thirds. It was found that reading skills of 3rd graders can be significantly improved through instruction in word-level skills, but not the reading skills of 5th graders.

        "description":"To its considerable credit, California has set rigorous standards for all of its students  in the past decade and provided considerable focus on where schools are falling short. Now, there are plentiful data about which schools and students are not succeeding. But the standards come with high stakes for students and schools-- consequences that have been heightened by the federal No Child Left Behind Act. Today's high school seniors are the first class that must pass the state's high school exit exam to receive a diploma, but far too many of the class of 2006 have faced math and English teachers who do not have the preparation to teach these subjects, which are the two covered by the exam. This report, offers a summary of the latest research and a brief set of charts and graphs that illuminate California's teaching force. A more detailed research report is available on the Web site (www.cftl.org) and includes a mixture of hard data and qualitative research based on extensive case studies from 10 districts across the state.

        "description":"The present study examined outcomes on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program/Achievement Test (TCAP/AT) for the KIPP:DIAMOND Academy (KIPP:DA), which is in its second year of operation. Importantly, as in Year 1, a rigorous quasi-experimental research design was employed, in which each KIPP:DA student was individually matched to a highly similar counterpart who attended one of several geographically proximate neighborhood schools. The 2004 TCAP/AT was taken by three subsamples of KIPP:DA students: (a) fifth graders who had completed their first year at the school, (b) sixth graders who had also completed their first year, and (c) sixth graders who had completed their second year at the school. &quot;Pretest&quot; analyses revealed that KIPP:DA and control students scored almost identically on the TCAP/AT in the year prior to the former group's enrollment in KIPP:DA. Comparisons between the three KIPP:DA groups and their matched control counterparts on each of the TCAP/AT subtests (Reading, Language Arts, Mathematics), directionally favored KIPP:DA in 7 out of the 9 analyses (median ES = +0.14) unadjusted for pretest score, and in 8 out of 9 analyses (median ES = +0.16) adjusted for pretest scores. Inferential analyses showed the KIPP:DA advantages to be statistically significant for only the fifth-grade and sixth-grade longitudinal cohort subsamples. Supplementary descriptive analyses of the criterion-referenced (CRT) portion of TCAP/AT further revealed that, while not statistically significant, KIPP:DA students in all three subsamples were more frequently represented than the matched control students at the Proficient and Advanced levels, and less frequently at the Below Proficient level, in both Reading/Language Arts and Mathematics. These results are clearly suggestive of positive KIPP:DA effects in Year 2, especially in view of the doubling of school size and special unanticipated challenges faced during the year.

        "description":"This report presents student-level achievement results for the four charter schools that began operation in Tennessee during the 2003-04 academic year. To conduct a rigorous and valid analysis of student achievement outcomes at these schools, we employed a matched program-control design at the student level, whereby each charter school student was paired to a comparable &quot;control&quot; student attending the same or similar school during 2002-03. The four charter schools were: Circles of Success in Learning Academy (COSLA), Memphis Academy of Health Sciences (MAHS), Memphis Academy of Science and Engineering (MASE), and the Smithson-Craighead Academy (SCA). The first three schools are located in Memphis and the fourth in Nashville. Participants in the study were 14 second graders from COSLA, 70 sixth graders from MAHS, 134 seventh graders from MASE, and 9 fourth graders from SCA. All had scores on the spring, 2003 (pre-implementation or &quot;pretest&quot;) and the spring, 2004 (posttest) Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program/Achievement Test (TCAP/AT) in Reading, Language Arts, and Math. The analyses of 2004 TCAP/AT scores for the three Memphis cohort schools showed directional advantages for the charter school students over their matched control counterparts on all three subtests. However, only the effect for MASE in Math was statistically significant. The median effect sizes were +0.15 for test scores unadjusted for pretest differences and +0.12 for adjusted scores, indicating small to moderate effects. When the results for all three schools were combined, significant  advantages for the charter school students occurred on both Reading (ES = +0.19) and  Math (ES = +0.19), with a directional advantage in Language Arts (ES = +0.12). Attendance was also significantly higher at two of the Memphis schools and directionally higher at the third. For SCA, however, the comparisons to control students yielded comparable to negative results. Because only 9 student matches were available for SCA, these results need to be viewed very cautiously relative to those from the three schools and much larger sample sizes in the Memphis cohort. Overall, the first-year achievement outcomes seem highly suggestive and impressive in view of the: (a) early (first-year) implementation of the charter school programs; (b) charter school students' transition to new schools, a factor normally associated with lower achievement; and (c) comparable magnitude of the effect sizes in Memphis to those obtained in prior research on established comprehensive school reform (CSR) models. The present study will be replicated over the next several years to examine first-year results for newly established charter schools and longitudinal outcomes for the entire population of Tennessee charter schools.

        "author":["Lake, Robin J."],
        "description":"This paper takes on the question of whether and how school authorizers should be held accountable for their own performance. The author presents reasons why scrutiny  and accountability are needed not only for schools but also for chartering agencies, identifies what types of accountability are present now, and offers ideas for ways accountability could be improved via private and government initiative. The author concludes that it is past time for increased scrutiny of charter authorizer practice, even if it means challenging long-standing traditions of local school board control. The charter school movement is best known for redefining school-level regulation. In the end, however, it may be that charter schooling's most significant contribution to public policy is to finally draw the state into the question of how much and what kind of local oversight is required to maximize the effectiveness of public schools, and to serve as a forerunner/prototype for NCLB-era results-based school accountability in general.

How can teachers learn to use the diverse urban classroom as a rich asset? By focusing on reconceptualizing general education studies, addressing key urban understanding and abilities throughout the professional program, implementing multiyear induction programs, and integrating outstanding veteran urban teachers, the authors of this volume take an affirming look at preparing teachers for the complexities of urban teaching. They candidly present lessons from a variety of urban settings for attracting, preparing, and supporting teachers who are both caring and qualified.

        "description":"Public opinion polls consistently show a strong, bi-partisan consensus on the need to invest in the nation's kids. Yet even as Americans demand a greater focus on children, public investments are shifting away from them. In California, this is leading to children who are increasingly unhealthy yet lack health insurance, failing in school or unable to enroll in preschool, and living in families that lack the most basic supports to be safe and secure. Children Now's goal is to bridge this gap between public will and public policies to ensure that children are the top public priority. The 2005 &quot;California Report Card&quot; provides an assessment of the current status of California's children. In this report, letter grades, A through F, are assigned to each children's policy area (Health; Family Economic Security; and Education) and reflect how well the state is meeting their needs. These grades are based on the most recent data available, including the 2005 &quot;California County Data Book,&quot; Children Now's companion research document, and Children Now's policy expertise. This report explores the issues in greater detail and aims to assist in moving forward the proposed agenda that will assure a healthy and rewarding future for the nation's children.

Both public and private institutions offer career tech programs. Many high schools allow students in their junior and senior years to take courses at institutions outside of the high school--such as regional occupational centers and community colleges--where they can continue their training after they graduate. This Q&amp;A largely focuses on career technical opportunities available after high school and how to evaluate them. [The Spanish version of this document is also included.]",

The student can still get a high school diploma whether he or she dropped out, failed the California High School Exit Exam, or did not have enough course credits. As many know, a high school diploma is a passport to a more interesting and better paying job. Those who do not complete high school will earn $270,000 less than high school graduates over their working lives, according to U.S. Census estimates. About 60% of 16- to 19-year-old dropouts are unemployed, according to a recent study. It is never too late.

        "description":"When policymakers talk about closing the achievement gap, the focus is typically on bringing the average performance of minority or economically disadvantaged  students in line with the average performance of White or middle-class students. From a statistical perspective, this strategy of bringing up the bottom to close the  achievement gap is illogical. It would require a massive movement of lower-performing students toward the middle of the score distribution to achieve similarly &quot;average&quot; scores if nothing is done simultaneously about raising test scores at the upper end of the score distribution. This report takes a different perspective and focuses on high-achieving Latino students and the language, culture, and immigration-status issues that can greatly affect their motivation and ultimate achievement. This report concludes by examining some policy options that are available to increase the academic achievement and educational attainment of Latino high achievers. It also offers some recommendations for programs and policies that can help convert the thin thread of hope held by many Latino high achievers into a sturdy lifeline to the future.

        "description":"One of the major barriers to making good on this promise is the broad set of misconceptions framing most discussions of the dropout issue. Too often, both public perception and public policy seem based on the notion that dropping out is confined to a small--and particularly unmotivated--group of young people. A related assumption, although rarely voiced, is that dropping out is primarily a problem of disaffected black and Hispanic central city youth who have rejected mainstream values, including the importance of education. Such views have reinforced a third widespread misconception: that there is little anyone can do to get most young people who leave school back on track--earning a high school degree and advancing to higher education. Making Good on a Promise challenges those beliefs. It paints a new, more accurate picture of the dropout problem facing the nation today, with a detailed look at who dropped out and how much education they had completed by their early adulthood. It  analyzes data from the first major national study to follow a representative group of young people over time: the National Educational Longitudinal Study, which tracked the educational  progress of approximately 25,000 eighth-graders in 1988 over 12 years, to 2000.

But it also helps schools learn the \"art\" of continuous improvement by helping them understand the many nuances and complexities of school change. In many ways, this balance between science and art offers a scaffolded approach to school improvement. Just as scaffolding is erected around a building when it is being constructed or repaired and is gradually removed as the structure is built, McREL initially provides very specific, prescriptive guidance based on the science of effective schools--as captured in a series of research studies and products described later in this document. Over time, McREL helps schools become increasingly responsible for identifying their own student needs and research-based solutions for meeting those needs. To explain how \"Success in Sight\" works, this document describes: (1) The science of school improvement, that is, the research-based guidance McREL provides schools through \"Success in Sight\"; (2) The \"Success in Sight\" school improvement process; and (3) The art of school improvement, offered as six key principles for improvement that underlie \"Success in Sight.\" (Contains 6 figures.)",

Meanwhile, the competitive edge of the U.S. workforce is slipping; several other developed countries now surpass the United States in the percentage of their young working-age population enrolling in college and attaining a bachelor's degree. At a time when the knowledge-based, global economy requires more Americans with education and training beyond high school, the nation confronts the prospect of a sustained drop in the average educational levels of the U.S. workforce. This report identifies four state policy dimensions for improving college readiness and success: (1) the alignment of coursework and assessments; (2) state finance; (3) statewide data systems; and (4) accountability.

Its aim is to provide information that will be useful for interpreting and comparing the results from the two assessments, based on an in-depth look at the content of the respective frameworks and assessment items. The report draws upon information provided by the developers of the assessments, as well as data obtained from an expert panel convened to compare the frameworks and items from the two assessments on various dimensions. The frameworks were compared with respect to: (1) how each assessment organizes and defines the science content, cognitive skills, and science processes to be assessed at each grade level; (2) the main content areas included and the set of topics covered in each; (3) how each assessment addresses scientific investigation or inquiry; and (4) the types and distribution of item formats used. The similarities and differences between NAEP and TIMSS are presented in this report for consideration when making meaningful comparisons and interpretations of the achievement results from the two assessments. While NAEP and TIMSS show similarities, particularly at the broad content area and topic level, differences are revealed by examining in more detail what the items in each assessment measure.

The Video Study is a supplement to the TIMSS 1999 student assessment, a successor to the TIMSS 1995 student assessment. The TIMSS 1999 Video Study had the broad purpose of investigating and describing teaching practices in eighth-grade mathematics and science in a variety of countries. Results for the science portion are presented in this report and in a summary document entitled &quot;Highlights From the TIMSS 1999 Video Study of Eighth-Grade Science Teaching (Roth et al.2006).&quot; The TIMSS 1999 Video Study of science teaching included the participation of five countries: Australia, the Czech Republic, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States. It had the following broad objectives: (1) Develop objective, observable measures of classroom instruction that can be quantified appropriately to develop indicators of eighth-grade science teaching practices in each country; (2) Describe patterns of science teaching practices within each country; and (3) Compare science teaching practices between countries and identify similarities and differences in lesson features across countries, with a focus on differences between higher and lower-achieving countries. Building on the interest generated by the TIMSS 1995 Video Study of mathematics teaching, the TIMSS 1999 Video Study of mathematics and science teaching had a final objective regarding effective use of the information: (1) To develop methods for communicating the results of the study, through written reports and video cases, for both research and professional development purposes. The results of the TIMSS 1999 Video Study Science suggest characteristic patterns of eighth grade science teaching in each of the participating countries and are suggestive of the potentially important role of content and a core instructional approach in student learning and achievement.

The goal of the conference was to distill the distinct characteristics of the educational experience research universities can offer and to articulate the \"value added\" of such an experience to undergraduates so that it is readily comprehended. The conference was organized around three plenary sessions, each of which probed an aspect of the overall theme. These sessions were followed by meetings in which small groups examined issues raised by the speakers from institutional and disciplinary perspectives. Some of the questions probed at the conference included: (1) Based on their singular assets, what is the unique educational experience research universities can offer? (2) How can universities integrate their dual missions of \"knowledge creation\" and \"knowledge transmission\" in order to enrich and give new meaning to their undergraduate programs? and (3) How can research universities communicate the value of a research-infused education to their diverse constituencies?

        "description":"During the course of a natural disaster or similar emergency, youth may be separated from their parents or guardians. After the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, for example, many youth were evacuated without their parents or guardians and sent to different locations, leaving the youth alone in the care of relief agencies. Other youth were on their own for a variety of reasons before the storms and remained so afterwards. For all of these youth, school can be the most stable and secure environment, offering structure and resources to help overcome the traumas they have experienced and helping to regain their academic, social, and emotional footing. Yet without a parent or guardian to advocate for them and exercise parental rights, these youth may face unique barriers to accessing education and related support services. Fortunately, federal education law, the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (Subtitle B--Education for Homeless Children and Youth), reauthorized as Title X, Part C of the No Child Left Behind Act, ensures educational protections for youth who are homeless and unaccompanied. This document explains key aspects of the law and provides strategies for implementation.

The project includes several components. The first was to conduct an extensive literature review to identify what is already known (the focus of this document). In addition to the literature review,  focus groups and site visits to projects that have been successful supporting reading among highly mobile students to identify practical, real-life applications of the concepts and strategies found in the literature are being conducted. This initial review and analysis of information will lead to further refinement of the current document. Illustrative cases will be interspersed to further operationalize the concepts presented here. Finally, a major emphasis in the next phase of the project will be to identify resources that are easily accessible to practitioners. This document is organized into the following chapters: (1) Reading and Highly Mobile Students; (2) General Educational Support Systems for Highly Mobile Students; (3) Theory and Research in Reading Instruction; (4) Characteristics of Effective Schools and Classrooms  in the Teaching of Reading; (5) The Components of Language and Reading Instruction; and (6) Concluding Thoughts.

Going to school helps these students find the structure, normalcy, and routine that is essential to their health and well-being. Federal law (The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act) protects the educational rights of students experiencing homelessness. It provides legal protections so that children and youth in homeless situations can enroll in, attend, and succeed in school and preschool programs. It also establishes procedures to enroll children quickly, assess their needs, and provide services. Finally, the McKinney-Vento Act requires that every school district designate a local homeless education liaison; the local liaison is the district's point person for addressing needs that derive from loss of housing and is, therefore, a key contact for relief agencies.

In addition to helping parents balance work and life responsibilities, these programs offer prime opportunities to enhance learning--particularly for struggling students. After-school programs also help to promote equity among students by providing additional services for low-performing students and creating supportive environments for all children. Policymakers must move past false choices pitting funding against quality or an academic focus against a positive social environment, and instead ensure that all federally funded after-school programs are high quality and effective in meeting their goals. In an environment where policy is rightly focused on increasing student learning, particularly among underserved students, after-school programs are an important tool for school districts and schools and they demand the support and attention of federal policymakers. This paper examines the federal government's role in after-school programs, surveys current research on them, and offers recommendations to expand access and improve the quality of afterschool programs.(Contains 30 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Arizona's charter experience over the past decade has clearly shown the power of a  relatively open chartering system. Schools have sprung up in all corners of the state;  parents and teachers have flocked to them in great numbers. Interesting new approaches have emerged. Quite a few of the schools have been strikingly successful. In many places, charter schools have achieved an impressive market share, and districts have begun to respond more vigorously in Arizona than in most charter school states. The experience has also demonstrated some of the pitfalls of the open approach: (1) a raft of questionable  schools; (2) charges and confirmed cases of various kinds of misdeeds; and (3) the resulting calls for a crackdown that could endanger the schools' autonomy and variety. As policymakers in Arizona seek to reset the balance, it is worth repeating that &quot;there's no place on Earth like the Grand Canyon State.&quot; Arizona has an opportunity to continue its leadership in this area, forging a new kind of accountability system--one that fulfills basic public responsibilities while still fostering the open charter environment that is the state's hallmark.

        "description":"In the past eight years, Chicago has created an excellent charter school model with help from across the city. Mayor Richard Daley supported the reform, Chicago Public Schools developed a thoughtful and proactive approval process, business and civic leaders championed the movement and provided technical support, and teachers and community  groups accepted the challenge of opening new schools. All deserve credit for the success to date. Renaissance 2010 will dramatically alter the landscape for Chicago's charters during the next five years. Hopefully, all of these actors can pull together again and make the Renaissance 2010 initiative an equally historic success. There are challenges ahead, but there  is also more than enough capacity in the &quot;city of big shoulders&quot; to tackle this one. This report examines the history and future of charter schools in the &quot;Land of Lincoln&quot; and how they are being used to spur education reform, reach underserved populations, and reinvigorate urban areas. It also recommends changes at the state level to boost the chances of success for Chicago's Renaissance 2010 plan. [This report is a product of the 21st Century Schools Project.]",

        "author":["Hassel, Bryan C."],
        "description":"This report has describes how the young Indianapolis charter school initiative can claim a number of successes: (1) Many community leaders have stepped forward to spearhead the creation of charter schools, bringing new energy and resources into public education; (2) Parents have flocked to the new schools, lining up on waiting lists and noting increasing satisfaction with their children's experiences; (3) Students in most charter schools are making steady progress in reading, language, and math, and in many cases outpacing Indiana and national norms for growth; and (4) The mayor has established a comprehensive  accountability system for the schools, with high expectations and transparent sharing of data about the schools with the public. As is the case elsewhere, the charter sector in Indianapolis will ultimately be judged by its effects on students, families, neighborhoods, and the city as a  whole, and those long-term effects remain to be seen. Though the elementary and middle schools are making good progress, they are still young. The one high school open in 2003-2004 struggled in its first year, and faces significant challenges as it enters its second year. In addition, the initiative's growth in 2004-2005 (doubling from five schools to 10) represents a much faster expansion than in the initiative's first two years, which could tax the mayor's systems. As of the spring of 2004, mayor-sponsored charter schools in Indianapolis represents a small fraction of the city's students--less than 1 percent. But just the schools already chartered will double that fraction by 2005 and triple it by 2008. If all goes as planned, more high-quality applicants will receive charters in the coming years. The result should be a large, vibrant sector of newly formed public schools. If successful, these schools will provide excellent educations for the children who attend them, forge new models that  can serve as examples for other schools, demonstrate effective accountability in action, and exert a wide, positive impact on public schooling in Indianapolis.

        "description":"In New York City and state, charter schools are slowly gaining momentum through performance that speaks for itself, and with quick action by authorizers and charter advocates when schools fail. But as the New York charter experience should demonstrate  to districts and states nationwide, meeting the urgent need for systemwide improvement is far beyond the capacity of most existing charter or even new small school supply efforts. The challenge for the next generation of charter school policy and implementation in every state will be to thoughtfully expand the number of new schools without sacrificing strong accountability, and to help school districts develop internal capacities to support  autonomous schools side-by-side with more centrally managed schools. In the meantime, the growing number of New York City charter schools and their students will continue to inspire with their courage, tenacity, and all-out effort. New York City community and policy leaders should be congratulated for their leadership and skill in creating the opportunity for charter schools to shine. This report looks at the history, status quo, challenges, and future of charter initiatives in the city, as well as for the rest of the state. (Contains 4 tables, 5 charts, and 33 endnotes.)

        "description":"Many students who attend school in California also take paper or computerized-adaptive tests developed in cooperation with the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA). These tests report student performance on a single, cross-grade scale, which NWEA calls the RIT scale. This scale was developed using Rasch scaling methodologies. RIT-based tests are used to inform a variety of educational decisions at the district, school, and classroom level. They are also used to monitor academic growth of students and cohorts. Districts choose whether to include these assessments in their local assessment programs. They are not state mandated. The versions of NWEA tests in use in California have been specifically aligned to match the content of local and California state curriculum standards. Because of this, it is believed there is a good match in content between the NWEA tests and the curriculum standards being used in California. In order to use the two testing systems to support each other, an alignment of the scores from the state and RIT-based tests is as important as the curriculum alignment. The current study is an expansion of a preliminary study of alignment of the California Standards Tests (CST) that was performed using data from one California school system in June 2003. It is one of an ongoing series of studies that are being conducted to identify the relationships between NWEA tests and state-mandated assessments. Studies of assessments in sixteen states have now been completed. The primary questions addressed in this study are: (1) To what extent do the same subject scores for the NWEA test correlate to the content-similar subjects on the CST? (2) What fall and spring RIT scores correspond to various performance levels on the CST tests? and (3) How well can &quot;proficient&quot; performance on the California assessments be predicted from fall and spring RIT scores?

        "author":["Mead, Sara"],
        "description":"There is widespread recognition of the importance of early childhood learning, and a strong public appetite for increased public support to ensure that young children enter school ready to learn. National surveys find that 87 percent of voters think state governments should provide funding so that all children can enroll in preschool. Unfortunately, state budget constraints and disagreement about specifics have for too long meant that policy debates produce only incremental tinkering with existing programs or a default reliance on the status quo that leaves too many children unprepared. Research shows that quality preschool  improves children's life chances and benefits society by improving long-term education outcomes and earnings; reducing crime, teen pregnancy and welfare rates; and reducing the costs of special and remedial education. Through these benefits, high-quality preschool can actually save the public as much as $7 for every $1 spent. Further, in the global, knowledge-based, modern economy, it is increasingly critical that schools equip all children with a higher level of skill than was required in the past. Americans are demanding more from public schools through NCLB. Making sure children enter school with the preparation and skill to learn is an important step toward meeting this challenge. More fundamentally, the national commitment to equal opportunity and merit-based advancement is undermined when large educational achievement gaps exist even before children enter school. Government cannot fully level the playing field, but universal access to prekindergarten is a way to provide starting blocks to the most disadvantaged children so they can compete on an equal footing.

        "description":"Each year, Montana students participate in testing as part of the state's assessment program. This past spring, students in grades 4, 8, and 10 took Montana Comprehensive Assessment System (MontCAS) tests in reading and mathematics. These tests serve as an important measure of student achievement for the state's accountability system. Results from these assessments are used to make state-level decisions concerning education, to meet &quot;Adequate Yearly Progress&quot; (AYP) reporting requirements of the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; (NCLB), and to inform schools and school districts of their performance. The Montana Office of Public Instruction has developed scales that are used to assign students to one of four performance levels on these tests. Many students who attend school in Montana also take tests developed in cooperation with the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA). The content of these tests are aligned with the Montana standards and they report student performance on a single, cross-grade scale, which NWEA calls the RIT scale. This study investigated the relationship between the scales used for the MontCAS assessments and the RIT scales used to report performance on NWEA tests. The study estimated the changes in reading and mathematics RIT score equivalents for the MontCAS performance levels in those subjects. Test records for more than 4,000 students were included in this study. Three methods generated an estimate of RIT cut scores that could be used to project MontCAS performance levels. Rasch SOS methods generally produced the most accurate cut score estimates. Accuracy of predicting MontCAS passing performance was well above 80% for all grades and subjects studied when using the best methodology. (Contains 14 tables and 5 figures.)",

Students in grades 3 and 5 take the Nevada Criterion Referenced Assessment (Nevada CRT) while students in grades 4 and 7 take the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS). These tests serve as an important measure of student achievement for the state's accountability system. Results from these assessments are used to make state-level decisions concerning education, to meet &quot;Adequate Yearly Progress&quot; (AYP) reporting requirements of the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; (NCLB), and to inform schools and school districts of their performance. The Nevada Department of Education has developed scales that are used to assign students to one of four performance levels on the Nevada CRT. These are, from the lowest cut score to the highest: &quot;developing,&quot; &quot;approaches,&quot; &quot;meets,&quot; and &quot;exceeds.&quot; For purposes of NCLB, the &quot;meets&quot; level is considered the level that represents satisfactory performance. Students taking the Iowa Test of Basic Skills are also assigned to one of four levels. These levels simply reflect the four quartiles reported in the ITBS norms. Many students who attend school in Nevada also take tests developed in cooperation with the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA). These tests report student performance on a single, cross-grade scale, which NWEA calls the RIT scale. This study investigated the relationship between the scales used for the Nevada state assessments and the RIT scales used to report performance on NWEA tests. The study determined RIT score equivalents for Nevada CRT and ITBS performance levels in reading and mathematics. Nevada CRT test records for more than 2,000 students were included in this study. Three methods generated an estimate of RIT cut scores that could be used to project Nevada CRT performance levels. Rasch SOS methods generally produced the most accurate cut score estimates. Accuracy of predicting Nevada CRT passing performance was above 84% for all grades when using the best methodology. Type I errors ranged from about 8% to 14% when the best methodology was employed.

Six Wisconsin school systems participated in the study, using test information from a group of over 1,500 students enrolled in fourth, eighth, and tenth grade who took both the WKCE and NWEA tests in the fall of 2003. Information from these tests was used in a comprehensive study to identify the capacity of the RIT scale to predict success on the WKCE and to identify performance level scores on the RIT scale that would indicate a good chance of success on this test. Three methodologies, linear regression, second order regression, and Rasch status on standards (called Rasch SOS) were used to derive estimates of cut scores. In each case the most accurate of the three estimates was used to arrive at the recommended cut score seen in this report. Cut scores for each of the performance levels at grades four and eight were estimated. Because of the small number of participating students at grade 10 (n=122), they estimated only the cut score for &quot;proficient&quot; performance at that grade. (Contains 6 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"This paper explains how the public education system resists reforms and shows  how to make much higher-performing schools available to disadvantaged children. It  explains why change is so difficult and why seemingly obvious solutions will not work.  The paper also shows how new ideas about teaching, learning, and effective schooling  can take hold, and details a portfolio management system--new set of structures  and incentives that fosters innovation, adaptability, and performance. Portfolio management is a new and different vision for education reform. It dramatically changes the roles, responsibilities, and incentives of virtually everyone in the public education system. Instead of trying to refurbish an old, ineffective public education structure, it aims to raze the current system to the ground and build a new one. Certainly, the need for such dramatic change is clear. Encumbered by a system that resists meaningful reform, the nation's schools are unable to educate millions of poor and minority students. If reformers are to build such a system, however, they must be prepared to stay with the effort and avoid partial measures. Just as new structures do not get slapped up overnight, this change will take time and effort. After all, it will require nothing less than the total transformation of the nation's public education system. (Contains 25 endnotes, 3 tables, and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"With some notable exceptions, public schools are doing a woeful job of teaching students about the world outside America's borders. For example, surveys conducted by the Asia Society and the National Geographic Society show a huge gap in most students' knowledge about the growing importance of Asia and other world regions to the nation's economic prosperity and national security.The surveys find that 25 percent of our college-bound high school students cannot name the ocean between California and Asia. Eighty percent do not know that India is the world's largest democracy. Young Americans are next to last in their knowledge of geography and current affairs compared with young adults in eight other industrial countries. The overwhelming majority cannot find Afghanistan or Israel on a world map, but know that a recent &quot;Survivor&quot; show was shot in the South Pacific. None of this should come as a surprise, since teachers are not prepared to teach about the world. Most prospective teachers do not take any international courses and have low participation rates in  study-abroad programs. These trends have serious consequences. In the 21st century, young people who understand the dynamics of global economic and intercultural  relations will have a distinct advantage in securing good jobs. Those with knowledge of  world history, languages, global health, and international affairs will be able to make informed decisions as voters about domestic issues influenced by global circumstances. By the same token, with an entire generation lacking in that knowledge, the United States is in danger of putting itself at a competitive disadvantage. Foreign language instruction in the United States must dramatically improve; students must have greater access to internationally themed educational opportunities; and teachers must be qualified to prepare young people for the opportunities and challenges of globalization. The stakes for students in the United States could not be higher in the 21st century, knowledge of the world is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. (Contains 9 endnotes.)",

        "description":"The federal government provides student loans for college and graduate school in two ways: by: (1) guaranteeing bank loans; and (2) by lending directly to students. Approximately three-quarters of federal student loans are guaranteed and one-quarter are direct. In the guaranteed loan program, a 40-year-old system, banks lend students money and profit from the interest payments while the government guarantees the loans against default and makes subsidy payments to the banks. In the direct loan system, the alternative President William J. Clinton enacted in 1993, middlemen are cut out of the process. The government provides low-interest loans directly to students, using borrower interest payments to help cover the costs of the program. The General Accounting Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have all found that switching completely to direct lending would save billions of dollars a year. Following their lead, President George W. Bush's latest budget tells Congress that the guaranteed student  loan program is structurally flawed, with &quot;unnecessary subsidies&quot; and &quot;inefficiencies.&quot; The  president's budget concludes: &quot;Significantly lower Direct Loan subsidy rates call into question the cost effectiveness of the [guaranteed student loan] program structure, including the appropriate level of lender subsidies.&quot; As analysts from across the political spectrum have pointed out, the money that would be saved by reforming the student loan program could be used to help more students. This nation, cannot afford to waste the potential of deserving young people. Congress should move all campuses to direct lending--or to an equally efficient guarantee approach if one can be designed--and capture those savings for the benefit of American families who are struggling to afford higher education.

Its considerable progress is sometimes obscured by headlines about the few schools at the top that generate enormous excitement and world-class achievement and the few at the bottom that use their autonomy for unwise or unethical ends. For charters in the middle that demonstrate both academic progress and operational proficiency, the key to quality expansion lies in eliminating the financial and regulatory obstacles discussed in this paper. Schools that have earned their spurs should be allowed to concentrate on student achievement instead of paperwork. Texas can also lead by acting decisively on schools that fail. A few have been shut down already, but mostly for financial and governance reasons. As the accountability system is refined, we will see more clearly which schools promote student growth, and which do not. Authorizers should have, and apply, the power to terminate failures. By providing more freedom at the top of the charter scale and more oversight at the bottom, Texas can enhance the contribution its charter sector is making. (Contains 3 tables and 100 endnotes.)",

Elementary and middle school students in grades 3 through 8 take the Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards--Dual Purpose Assessment (AIMS DPA) in reading, writing, and mathematics. These tests serve as an important measure of student achievement for the state's accountability system. Results from these assessments are used to make state-level decisions concerning education, to meet &quot;Adequate Yearly Progress&quot; (AYP) reporting requirements of the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; (NCLB), calculate status and improvement indicators for AZ LEARNS, the state accountability system, and to inform schools and school districts of their performance. The Arizona Department of Education has developed scales that are used to assign students to one of four performance levels on these tests. Many students who attend school in Arizona also take tests developed in cooperation with the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA). The content of these tests are aligned with the Arizona standards and they report student performance on a single, cross-grade scale, which NWEA calls the RIT scale. This study investigated the relationship between the scales used for the AIMS assessments and the RIT scales used to report performance on Northwest Evaluation Association tests. The study estimated the changes in reading and mathematics RIT score equivalents for the AIMS performance levels in those subjects. Test records for more than 20,000 students were included in this study. The information gathered in this study came from measures employing the NWEA RIT Scale. Because all of the research that we have to date indicates that scores generated from computer-based tests and Achievement Level Test (ALT) scores are virtually interchangeable, readers should feel comfortable applying the results of this study in any setting that uses the RIT scale.

The RIT scale was developed using Rasch scaling methodologies. RIT-based tests are used to inform a variety of educational decisions at the district, school, and classroom level. They are also used to monitor the academic growth of students and cohorts. Districts choose whether to include these assessments in their local assessment programs. The study estimated the changes in reading and mathematics RIT score equivalents for the ISTEP+ performance levels in those subjects. Test records for more than 20,000 students were included in this study. Three methods generated an estimate of RIT cut scores that could be used to project ISTEP+ performance levels. Rasch SOS methods generally produced the most accurate cut score estimates. Accuracy of predicting ISTEP+ passing performance was well above 80% for all grades and subjects studied when using the best methodology. The study included test records from over 25,500 students enrolled in 11 Indiana school systems. These students had taken both the state assessment and NWEA assessments in fall of 2004; many had also taken NWEA assessments in spring of 2004. Student records were included when a student had both a valid NWEA scale score and a valid ISTEP+ score in the equivalent subject for the fall season. The primary questions addressed in the study are: (1) What RIT scores correspond to various performance levels on the ISTEP+ tests? (2) How do these RIT scores differ from the 2003 estimates of performance level?;and (3) How well can performance on the Indiana assessments be predicted from RIT scores when NWEA assessments are administered in the same fall and the prior spring?

        "description":"In 2003, the legislature and governor enacted House Bill 1909 to create a pilot project on competency-based transfer between two--and four--year colleges and universities. The legislation directed the Higher Education Coordinating Board (HECB) to select institutions to define transfer requirements in several disciplines on the basis of students' skills and knowledge. Eastern Washington University and the two community colleges in Spokane, which volunteered to undertake the project, began the pilot in fall 2003. The participating institutions, in collaboration with the Higher Education Coordinating Board, were directed to report on the progress and status of the project to the legislative higher education committees by December 1, 2005. This report, subject to the approval of the HECB, is intended to fulfill that requirement. Competency-based transfer is described in the statute as &quot;the knowledge, skills and abilities students should possess in order to enter an upper division program in a particular academic discipline.&quot; In contrast to the current system, it does not necessarily involve &quot;seat time&quot; or the  successful completion of a specified number of classes as a measure of student achievement and preparation for transfer. Rather, students must demonstrate that they have mastered the necessary knowledge through a series of assessments. The objective of the legislation was to create a pilot project that explored how these &quot;competencies&quot; could be developed and assessed so that they could be used as the basis for transfer evaluation and admission to upper division programs. Appended are: (1) CBT Workgroup Participants; (2) Final Report: Criminal Justice; (3) Final Report: Elementary Education; (4) Final Report: Computer Science; and (5) Substitute House Bill 1909.",

        "description":"Recently NWEA completed a project to connect the scale of the Maryland School Assessment (MSA) with NWEA's RIT scale. One large school system participated in the study, using test information from a group of over 24,000 students enrolled in third, fourth and fifth grade who took both the MSA and NWEA reading tests in the spring of 2005. Information from these tests were used in a comprehensive study to identify the capacity of the RIT scale to predict success on the MSA and to identify performance level scores on the RIT scale that would indicate a good chance of success on this test. Three methodologies, linear regression, second order regression, and Rasch status on standards (called Rasch SOS) were used to derive estimates of cut scores. In each case the most accurate of the three estimates was used to arrive at the recommended cut score seen in this report. The authors estimated cut scores for each of the performance levels at grades three, four and five for reading. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)",

It is intended to be used as a companion document to the statute and regulations, as well as a technical assistance resource. The guidance is organized in three major sections: the comprehensive needs assessment, the comprehensive plan, and the annual program evaluation. The first section suggests a process for organizing and conducting the needs assessment. It also discusses planning in general, not only as the prerequisite to change and reform, but also as an ongoing and transparent activity that must be used throughout all aspects of schoolwide program implementation. The second section addresses the development of the comprehensive plan and its required components, emphasizing the importance of involving all key stakeholders. The third describes a strategic approach to the required evaluation of the program, which loops back to the planning component. Each begins with a brief discussion followed by a more detailed explanation of specific program requirements. Research-based principles and practical approaches for implementation are also included, and each section ends with questions and answers on specific topics, as needed.

In recent years, educational experts have put increasing emphasis on the need for triangulation of student achievement information in order to assure that important educational decisions are based on data that is robust and corroborated. Indeed, many school systems use NWEA assessments as one way in which they triangulate data from their state assessment and other tests that may be in use in their district. The catalyst for this investigation was completion of a recent study to confirm and monitor the alignment between the PACT and NWEA assessments (Cronin, 2004). For the most part it was found that the two assessments remained closely correlated and that NWEA results predicted PACT status reasonably well. Nevertheless, it was also found that performance level estimates at a few grades showed large changes and that the predictive accuracy statistics stemming from the 2004 study were both lower than those generated from the 2002 study and also lower than those gathered from most of the other state studies.(Contains 12 tables.)",

It is worth mentioning that Differential Item Functioning (DIF) is not quite the same as what has commonly been called &quot;bias.&quot; Differential item functioning is an item characteristic that occurs whenever groups differ noticeably in their correct answer frequency, when achievement level is matched. It may be used as part of the process to identify biased items, but is almost always viewed as secondary to a sensitivity review. Because of its statistical nature, many items that are identified as having DIF are not identified as having any difficulty in the sensitivity review. (Contains 14 tables and 18 figures.)",

This series will use achievement information from a broad sample of students and schools to provide evidence about the changes that have occurred since the law passed. This study examines how well the law is beginning to meet its promise in its first years of implementation. It investigates: (1) how much student achievement status has changed since the law was implemented; (2) whether and to what extent student achievement growth has changed since the law was implemented; and (3) the impact of the law on the achievement status and growth of students by ethnic group. It also addresses with the following research questions: (1) Are students' achievement scores higher than they were when NCLB first went into effect? (2) Is student achievement growth higher than it was when NCLB first went into effect? (3) Are achievement gaps among ethnic groups shrinking under NCLB? and (4) Given current rates of change in achievement, are schools likely to meet the requirements of NCLB? To investigate these questions, the study uses a large sample of student achievement scores, selected from a broad cross section of school districts throughout the United States.

Generally, the United States did not differ from the other 19 countries in terms of the distribution of SES and family factors on four, but not all, of the characteristics. These were parental education, the number of books in the home, immigrant status, and language spoken at home. There were differences when looking at two characteristics parent occupation and family structure. The United States had a higher percentage of 15-year-olds with parents of high occupational status and a higher percentage of 15-year-olds residing in non-two-parent households compared to the 20-country average.

The report distinguishes between &quot;status risk factors&quot; such as SES and race/ethnicity and two other sets of risk factors: behavioral risk factors and academic risk factors. Behavioral risk factors are behaviors and attitudes closely related to learning, for example, attendance, paying attention to the teacher, completing coursework, and developing a sense that schooling is important to future life successes. These behaviors and attitudes are referred to as school engagement. &quot;Disengagement&quot; (e.g., not attending class, not completing assignments) can create severe impediments to learning.

The logic of NCLB is straightforward: improving the nation's schools for all children requires the establishment of clear and high standards, the identification of schools in which students are not meeting those standards, options for parents of students in schools identified for improvement,  support for struggling schools, and--for those schools that continue to perform poorly--increasingly rigorous interventions. This report presents the key findings over the three years of the study. Findings from 2002-03, the first full year of NCLB implementation, showed that states and districts were making progress in implementing accountability systems under NCLB but that big gaps remained between their existing systems of accountability and the NCLB vision of coherent systems that support all schools and all students to reach high standards. During 2003-04, educators at all levels of the education system continued efforts to implement the accountability provisions of NCLB closing the gap in some areas but not all as described below.

In particular, this brief addresses the following questions: (1) Does the use of educational technology foster student academic achievement?; (2) How is educational technology being used in Indiana and across the nation?; (3) Is educational technology a cost-effective tool for Indiana's public schools?; (4) Given limited fiscal resources and the need to comply with NCLB standards, what are the most effective ways to utilize the technology already in place? To help meet the challenge of preparing  students for their vocations, states continue to support significant K-12 technology initiatives. For example, Grade 8 students in Cincinnati, Ohio, public schools are now able to apply to the district high school of their choice via computer, resulting in more educational options to better match students' longterm career goals.

Title I is designed to support state and local school reform efforts tied to challenging state academic standards in order to reinforce efforts to improve teaching and learning for students struggling to meet state standards. Homeless students are part of Title I, Part A's target population of disadvantaged students. However, the high mobility, trauma, and deep poverty associated with homelessness create unique educational barriers and challenges. Homelessness is associated with lower standardized test scores and a higher likelihood of missing school and/or experiencing multiple transfers. Thus, homeless students often require additional supports for academic achievement and success on state assessments.

        "description":"The objective of this work is to provide transfer students with a pathway that will prepare them in the same manner as direct entry students for a specific major at any public baccalaureate institution in the state, and for any of the independent institutions that wish to join the agreement. Wherever possible, the work groups were encouraged to stay within the boundaries of the current Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA) or the current Associate of Science Transfer Degree (AS-T). The DTA and AS-T allow students to transfer to a baccalaureate institution as juniors, with most or all of their lower-division general education requirements fulfilled. All public and many private baccalaureate institutions accept students with a DTA or AS-T package, eliminating the necessity of evaluating each course on a transcript. The DTA outlines broad areas in which students must complete credits (e.g., communication skills, quantitative skills, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and electives). The AS-T has a similar structure, with more specificity in math and science. The benefit of developing new pathways within the DTA and AS-T lies in the identification of specific courses that will better prepare students for their majors at baccalaureate institutions. For example, a student intending to major in English might choose among a variety of natural science courses, while a student intending to major in nursing would need to take certain chemistry courses as part of his or her natural science requirements.

Currently, the University of Washington operates branch campuses in Bothell and Tacoma. The Bothell campus is located on the same campus as Cascadia Community College. Washington State University operates branches in Vancouver and the Tri-Cities. In 2004, in recognition of the need to more clearly define the branch campuses' role and mission, the Legislature and governor enacted House Bill 2707, calling for each branch campus to conduct a self-study and make recommendations to the state regarding its future mission and development. These studies were submitted in November 2004 to the HECB, which was directed to evaluate the institutional proposals and develop its own policy options and recommendations from a statewide perspective. The board worked closely with the UW and WSU to develop the guidelines under which the branch campus self-studies were prepared. (Contains 20 tables.)",

To reinforce this outcomes-based approach, the plan proposed that the state develop a new funding method to reward public colleges and universities for student success. Specifically, it proposed that the state allocate higher education funding based on enrollment in the 2005-07 biennium and then transform the funding system beginning with the 2007-09 biennium. The board outlined four potential approaches to implementing the new system: (1)  Performance contracts that involve a formal pact between the state and an institution that spell out the obligations of both parties; (2) Budget provisos that would define legislative expectations for a college or university in terms of degrees and performance targets rather than enrollment levels; (3) Calculating enrollment levels at the time of course completion rather than on the 10th day of classes; and (4) Changing the criteria for selecting high-demand programs for funding from delivering enrollments to producing results.",

The project's major purpose was to encourage high school students to consider K-12 teaching as a career option. To that end, the project seeks to develop a seamless pathway of teacher preparation, starting in high school and continuing through a community college and on to professional certification at a baccalaureate university. The intent was to develop and model a seamless 2+2+2 pathway that could be implemented by other institutions. Multiple recruitment tools to reach interested students, paraprofessionals and other professional educators were developed, including presentations at community meetings, a student conference, a digital video disk, an informational brochure, a television program, and a Web site (www.dttw.net). Curriculum to support this pathway was developed for prospective teachers as a portfolio-based college-level course called EDUCation 100, which provides an orientation to professional education. The high school equivalent is the Teaching Academy program. To support the transfer of credits between the institutions, an articulation agreement from the Spokane Public Schools and Spokane Falls Community College was created and implemented for those students who participated in a Teaching Academy program. To further support this pathway, students enrolled in the teacher preparation program at EWU will receive credit for fulfilling their pre-certification requirements.",

The impact may be personal and direct as a child or grandchild moves through the schooling process. Or, it may well relate to the quality of employees and, thus, chances for business success. Certainly, the impact the educational system in this country will have on the quality of all of lives is apparent. The knowledge gained, the work habits developed, and even the moral values learned by today's students in schools will, for every American, at least partially determine the future efficacy of America's health care system, affect our place as a country in the world market place, and influence the level of safety and security Americans will experience individually and collectively in the coming decades. Within this context, this paper presents both possibilities and critical issues related to what the future holds for the field of education and the facilities that house it. This is done with the hope that, regardless of one's role or position- that is, parent, educator, employer, or citizen- the reader will gain a greater sense of what to expect in terms of the direction of education, and how school facilities will be affected by- and affect- that direction. The anticipation is that, by enhanced understanding of educational trends, people will individually and collectively be better able to successfully fulfill various individual, societal, and corporate roles and responsibilities in the coming years.",

This report describes the research and fieldwork conducted by Consumers Union's Healthy Kids, Healthy Schools project exploring opportunities to connect schools with Healthy Families and Medi-Cal. The report describes existing school-based enrollment efforts, and offers policy recommendations for making outreach and enrollment activities an integral part of the mission of California's public schools. Between January and June of 1999, Healthy Kids, Healthy Schools compiled demographic data on California's schools in  areas with the greatest need for school-based outreach for children's health insurance programs. Written surveys were conducted with school nurses and Healthy Start staff and telephone surveys were conducted with school personnel statewide. Both survey responses and fieldwork indicated that partnerships between schools, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies are highly effective in promoting Healthy Families and Medi-Cal. Resulting policy recommendations include: (1) finding additional resources to initiate and support school outreach and enrollment activities; (2) testing school-based outreach and enrollment strategies through pilot projects; (3) developing policy to institutionalize school-based efforts to reduce numbers of uninsured children; (4) developing policy to reflect  schools' experiences with health insurance outreach and enrollment initiatives and to facilitate schools' participation in these activities; (5) improving the state's methods for gathering and analyzing data on Healthy Families/Medi-Cal enrollment to identify the most effective forms of outreach; (6) and conducting additional research on the connection between health insurance and school performance. The report concludes by asserting that linking schools and health insurance offers a golden opportunity to expand health care coverage to all of California's children--the first step toward healthier kids and healthier schools.

        "description":"This report details the outcomes for children enrolled in two types of early intervention programs in Delaware: those serving young children with disabilities and those serving young children living in poverty. The Delaware Early Childhood Longitudinal Study was designed as a retrospective, two-group, posttest-only design. Participating in the study were 717 kindergarten students entering school in the Fall of 1997 in 8 of Delaware's school districts. The sample was stratified according to socioeconomic level and presence of disability, and included 217 kindergartners with active Individualized Education Plans, 250 students qualifying for free lunch at the start of the school year, and 250 students from the general student population who did not have a disability or quality for  free lunch. Forty-nine students had received early childhood or Head Start services, and 89 had received preschool special education services. Because only 5 children had received services from the birth-to-3 early intervention system, there was no analysis of this program's impact on child outcomes. Findings revealed that students who received services through the state funded programs, Head Start, or the special education preschool programs showed significantly better academic outcomes than students who did not receive these early intervention services. Children living in poverty who received early childhood education and Head Start services performed better academically 4 years after receiving these services than those children living in poverty who did not participate in the services.  Students with disabilities who were identified during their preschool years and who received special services when they were 3 and 4 years old performed better academically 4 years after receiving those services than children who were not identified as needing special education services until they entered kindergarten or later.

The study also addresses centralization and decentralization in the British Columbia system. The data was gathered through analyzing primary and secondary sources of literature as well as interviews with key informants. Therefore the methodology used was qualitative and interpretive in nature and based on the historical method and underlying assumptions of hermeneutics. The study found that throughout the decades, the B.C. system has had a history of voluntary collaboration, but the  collaboration has been gradually blended over time with provincial coordination as government built a system of autonomous institutions. The study makes the following conclusions based on the data: (1) an appropriate balance may be achieved between centralization and decentralization in order to create an effective system; (2) B.C.'s history and other experiences; and (3) the Ministry and institutions should build on the history of voluntary collaborative efforts.

The document concludes with a discussion of data and recommendations. Some of these recommendations include the following: (1) having eminent teacher organizations, such as the NCATE, establishing task forces in the teacher education arena; and (2) accrediting agencies and policy makers should hold their teacher education institutions accountable for retention and recruitment of males and students of color.

The document gives a list of qualifications that students must meet in order to be eligible to apply for the Grant and a list of 2001-2002 opportunity grant recipients. Once students have received the Grant, they must make satisfactory academic progress to continue to receive the Grant at their institutions. In the years 2001-2002, nineteen million dollars was awarded to students. The report provides a  comparison of the Grant program to similar programs in other states such as Washington. The system is currently facing three major issues: (1) unmet needs; (2) student work and loan burden; and (3) merit based aid. The report concludes that although Oregon is currently facing a fiscal crisis, it is still moving towards an investment in public services that will increase access to an affordable post-secondary education for citizens of Oregon.

The report offers summary statistics about DVC's students and programs, and the state and county (Contra Costa) environment in which DVC functions.

This disparity among the service areas is magnified when one examines the unemployment rate for individual cities. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate for the state was 7% during the same period. The report argues that the low unemployment rate in the service area is affected by  DVC's and other colleges' vocational education programs. DVC serves an enrollment population of more than 23,000 students each semester, with female students typically outnumbering male students.

Of the new students, 46% enrolled in college level courses only in their first year compare to 44% in the prior two years. (2) A substantial proportion of  graduates enroll in pre-college developmental math, English or reading. In their first year after high school, 10,204 graduates (54%) enrolled in one or more of these developmental classes. And (3) community and technical colleges continue to be the choice for a substantial proportion of high school graduates with 31% of graduates coming straight to college and an additional 16% attending for the first time one or two years after high school graduation. Within three years of graduation, 47% have enrolled at community or technical college in Washington. (JS)",

The assessment addressed the mission statement of the college as well as its long-term goals. The mission statement was unchanged. In regards to long-term goals for the college, the college deleted one goal that had already been achieved and changed some of the other goals in order to better reflect the mission of the school. The Administrative Review Committee evaluated two major administrative departments, as well as the relationship between college and the College Foundation. The Academic Program Review Committee also assessed the effectiveness of the following eight curricula: (1) Developmental Studies; (2) Civil Engineering Technology; (3) Electronics  Engineering Technology; (4) Electronics Technology; (5) Forestry Management Technology; (6) Massage Therapy; (7) Personal Trainer; and (8) Phlebotomy. The assessment was successful in several ways. For one, it found that there were no major problems with the system. Secondly, the assessment yielded a list of tasks to be accomplished in the near future that will allow the college to attain its long-range goals. The document concludes by mentioning that the college is currently in the midst of developing the Annual Objectives for 2003-2004 and completing a list of administrative and academic programs for review.

Some of the benefits are students earning more money and society benefiting through avoided costs such as reduced welfare and unemployment, improved health, and reduced crime. The study is divided into the following four chapters: (1) overview of the benefits measured; (2) the major assumptions underlying the analysis; (3) presentation of the main socioeconomic, business, and statewide economic results; and (4) a sensitivity analysis of some the key assumptions and tracking the changes in the changes in the results as assumptions are changed. The authors address the fact that although all sectors of society benefit directly or indirectly through higher education, higher education requires a big  investment. Therefore all education stakeholders (such as taxpayers, legislatures, employers, and students) want to know that they are getting their money's worth. To address this concern, the study investigates the attractiveness of the returns generated in the state relative to alternative public investments. The benefits are presented on three ways: (1) annual benefits; (2) present values of future annual benefits including rates of return and benefit/cost ratios; and (3) statewide economic benefits including returns to the business community.

Beyond baseline demographic data, little comparative work has been completed that examines how they differ, particularly in areas such as study behavior and technology use. This initial, exploratory study was conducted in response to questions by scholars visiting the United States who particularly wanted to see how these students differ, and what kinds of implications these differences might have regarding the delivery of services or creation of policy. A survey instrument was distributed at seven geographically disparate community college campuses, and at two geographically  disparate university campuses. One hundred and one four-year students and 218 two-year students completed the surveys. The questions relevant to the current discussion pertained to study skills and technology abilities. Findings indicate that community college students, perhaps because they are older and already participating in the work force, show a greater reliance on technology. Neither group indicated they made use of tutors or college skills centers, and both groups indicated that they studied at home and alone. (NB)",

The study addresses four types of benefits: (1) contributions to job and income formation; (2) higher earnings captured by existing students; (3) a broad collection of social benefits (improved health, reduced crime, lower welfare, and unemployment); and (4) the return to the taxpayers for their community college support. The results of the study on these benefits areas are as follows: (1) by educating students and adding them to the local workforce, the HCC instruction adds $683.7 million in annual earnings to the Tampa Bay economy; (2) for every credit completed, the average student will earn $143 more per year; and (3) the money spent  by the state government on education is beneficial to the taxpayers since people with higher education are less likely to abuse substances, use welfare or unemployment benefits, and commit crimes. The document gives much more evidence regarding the benefits of the HCC and concludes that the HCC is a great investment from a variety of perspectives. The college expands the minds of students, reduces demands for social services, and contributes to state and local economies. (MZ)",

ATE aims to promote systemic reform of the nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The study analyzed the influence of the ATE program on the nature of STEM programs in community colleges, the partnerships they formed, and the characteristics of the colleges in which they are located. Six ATE projects and four national centers were examined between October 2000 and January 2002. Information was gathered through site visits and ATE project and center websites. The study aimed to answer questions regarding how the ATE centers influence STEM pedagogy, how inquiry-based teaching infuses underlying  academic knowledge into the training of technicians, what role ATE programs play in developing and improving articulation between community colleges and four-year institutions, and a number of other questions. A central goal of the study was to analyze the ATE projects and centers with respect to the institutionalization and sustainability of ATE-initiated or funded activities once funding ceases. The study found that output strategies have been more prevalent in the programs than process-oriented approaches, in spite of the fact that process-oriented strategies are more sustainable. The NSF would like to see the innovations and reforms that it funds institutionalized and sustained once ATE funding ends. (Contains 36 references.) (NB)",

The widespread use of computer email systems for both faculty and student communication, and of web sites and the Internet for research, teaching, and dissemination has raised concerns regarding the protection of academic freedom. This paper examines a variety of educational computer use policies and makes recommendations for good practice in this area. In addition, the paper discusses evolving interpretations of copyright and fair use in light of the  availability of digital material, and makes recommendations to both authors and users of this material. Finally, it provides a philosophical setting for discussions of intellectual property issues. Specific recommendations for involvement and action of local academic senates are included, as well as suggestions to faculty in general.

The author utilized the concept of consequential transition as developed by King Beach as a lens for examining progress over time in the relationship of the transfer student to the new four-year university. Thirty-five transfer students were interviewed in January of their second semester at Michigan State University (MSU) regarding their community college experiences and their first semester at MSU. Thirty students returned to recount their second semester experiences and to compare them with their first semester and their community college experiences. The author developed five themes: (1) Learning Resources; (2) Connecting; (3) Familiarity; (4)  Negotiating; and (5) Integrating. The themes played out in three environments: (1) Academic; (2) Social; and (3) Physical. The 35 students were lived both on- and off-campus. They had attended only one community college, transferred in with 45 credits or more, were ages 18-24, and were full-time students with various majors. The author found that a transfer orientation course can be valuable, and that informal sources, such as friends who were MSU natives, were the most highly utilized resource. Campus activities and formal peer mentor programs, as well as living on campus, assisted in the peer connection process. (Contains 83 references.) (NB)",

        "description":"This document describes a potential crisis at Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC) due to the large numbers of faculty who are approaching or have already reached retirement age. NVCC is the third largest community college in the nation, made up of five campuses, soon to be six, and an Extended Learning Institute for distance learning. NVCC mirrors their diverse community with an equally diverse student, staff and faculty population. A study by the NVCC Office of Institutional Research found that a large number of the current staff are eligible to retire and many more are approaching eligibility. The Division Chairs Round Table (DCRT) met to discuss how to confront the potential crises of hiring as much as 50% of the division's instructional faculty at one time. The article  reviews research on the successful nature of orientation and mentoring programs for faculty. It also describes a plan developed by the DCRT to create a New Faculty Orientation Task Force and the specifics of the task force including the members, the budget, the meeting schedule, and the proposed goals. Following this, the paper describes the development, implementation and the outcomes of the New Faculty Orientation and Mentoring Program. Includes a figure illustrating the phases of the NVCC New Faculty Orientation and Mentoring Program. (JS)",

        "description":"This document discusses results from a Campus Climate survey conducted at Cypress College on faculty and staff during the fall 2000 semester. The survey queried employees regarding their general perception of the campus, ethnic diversity, job satisfaction, and perceptions of the students and programs. This was the first time such a study was conducted among the faculty and staff at Cypress College. The survey was sent out to all the faculty, staff and administrators at Cypress College, approximately 1,000 individuals. The response rate was about 33%. Respondents from the survey were predominantly full-time, Caucasian, male, and members of the faculty. The article outlines and discusses results for: (1) socio-demographic characteristics; (2) general college atmosphere; (3)  facilities and safety; (4) campus communication; (5) diversity and gender; (6) student recruitment and retention; (7) perceptions of students; and (8) job satisfaction. It concludes that, in general, employees have a positive view of the college, their jobs, and the students they serve. However, campus facilities received negative ratings by nearly half the respondents. Appendix A contains the full text of the survey. Appendix B contains responses to the qualitative survey items.

The information in this volume is intended to supplement the main report on The Socioeconomic Benefits Generated by Hillsborough Community College. The main study focuses only on the overall economic impacts generated by community colleges without reference to gender or ethnicity differences. These results were kept separate from the main report because gender and ethnicity were not the focus of the study. However, it is noted that gender and ethnicity are important variables that help to characterize the student body profile. This document also emphasizes that these results are made available for the sake of  completeness of the study, and that they should be used with caution and not for any political agendas. These results are made available with the intent to provide community college presidents with pertinent information should they have any specific questions regarding the data of the main report. Lastly, the document explains that tables 19 and 20 in this report are particularly important because they provide data needed for computing the investment analysis results that are described in the main report.

        "description":"Major trends in the development of adult education in Croatia can be considered in four periods: (1) from the time that Croatia was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire; (2) the period between the two World Wars when Croatia was part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia; (3) the post-World-War-II period when Croatia was part of the Yugoslav socialist economy; and (4) from 1990, the period of independence and development of a state governed by democratic rule. This paper traces the development of adult education through these periods. Despite the fact that andragogic practice and theory in Croatia evolved under unfavorable conditions, analyses of adult education development in Croatia point to a series of achievements in the sphere of adult education and the development of andragogic ideas  that form a solid basis for further development. Future development of adult education in Croatia will be similar to that of other countries in transition (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Slovenia, and Lithuania). These include the problems of education for democracy, retraining, additional education for the market economy, and for the other forms of adult education that are meant to improve the transition processes of society.

This study examined four of nine key focus areas of IPLP: teaching diverse student populations, content area knowledge, clinical experience, and technology integration. It focused on students' satisfaction with program components, cooperating teachers' perceptions of the program, and how the program responded to students' needs. Data were collected  via program feedback forms, and results were organized by content area, student cohort, semester of enrollment, and common themes. Data analysis indicated that students' and cooperating teachers' perceptions of the program were inconsistent across content areas. There was evidence that the program responded to student needs. Students perceived program improvement in some areas but program decline in other areas. An appendix presents data on the percentage of students whose comments were significant themes. (SM)",

        "author":["Perry, Laura B."],
        "description":"The fall of communism in 1989 brought a renewed interest in the educational systems of central and eastern Europe. Many foreign scholars claim that post-communist schooling is undemocratic, or at best transitionally democratic. For schools to democratize, they argue, teachers must become less authoritative; teaching methods should focus more on critical thinking skills, rather than memorization; schools should become warmer, more informal, and student-centered; and authorities should develop new civics textbooks and curricula. The belief that schooling in the post-communist region is less democratic than in the western school systems is based on two assumptions: (1) school atmosphere and relations, teaching methods, and curriculum are indeed anti-democratic in the post-communist  countries; and (2) education's role in fostering democratization is limited to these in-school, micro-level mechanisms. The paper addresses these two assumptions and considers democratic aspects of post-communist schooling, such as the way schools are funded. It concludes that, rather than western educators feeling superior when they study education in post-communist countries, they should realize these post-communist countries can offer insights into some of the most pressing problems in education at the beginning of the 21st century.

        "description":"This project examines the religious implications of an approach to &quot;limmudei kodesh&quot; (primarily the study of Talmud) and &quot;halakhah&quot; (an integration of academic scholarship with traditional Torah study and the evaluation of the educational pros and cons of a curriculum built on such a synthesis). In the concerted effort over the past century to develop a program of &quot;Torah U-Madda&quot; that synthesizes Torah and worldly pursuits, Torah scholars have endorsed the value of secular knowledge as a complimentary accoutrement to the &quot;Talmud Torah&quot; endeavor, but few have validated the application of secular academic tools and methodologies to Torah study or developed a model for such integrated Torah learning. The Torah scholar committed to synthesis seeks to employ historical knowledge and  methodological tools in the decoding of halakhic texts as a means of contributing to the halakhic discourse. Traditional &quot;Talmud Torah&quot; does not address the realm of pesak halakhah, but it is nonetheless considered the highest form of religious expression. This project explores the expansion of &quot;Talmud Torah&quot; boundaries and the religious dimensions of such an expansion. The suggestion is that for students who question the applicability of halakhic practice to contemporary reality, an approach to Torah study that attempts to synthesize historical, academic scholarship with classical Torah learning has the potential to deepen appreciation for the richness and compelling authority of tradition by demonstrating that for 2000 years, halakhic Jews have been struggling with the same essential  question: how to make ancient law meaningful to modern man.

Participants included campus officers responsible for student assessment and institutional research and others with experience using NSSE data. The paper summarizes the key points about uses of the data, effective communication strategies, and ideas for further uses of NSSE data. NSSE data are being used to assess the first year experience, assess graduating seniors, and assess student experiences by academic department and major. The data have been embedded in larger improvement initiatives that include  accreditation reports and reviews, agendas for improvement, and faculty participation in improvement. Campus leaders are referring to NSSE data in their work, and survey participants have developed good communication strategies to emphasize the portions of NSSE data that are most useful for a designated purpose. Among the suggestions for future uses of NSSE data are: (1) develop a comparison group of institutions; (2) develop a strategy for oversampling; (3) pay close attention to response rates; and (4) enlist student interest in and support of the NSSE survey.

Participants included individuals with state-level responsibilities for higher education and representatives of three universities. Kentucky has already taken steps to combine attention to accountability with efforts to support institutional improvement. In recent years, all colleges and universities in the state have engaged in substantial activity to demonstrate and increase their educational  effectiveness. Statewide surveys and workshops have been conducted, and the state has set specific goals and timelines for institutional action. In its review of Kentucky's experience, the roundtable focused on: (1) state-level uses of NSSE data; (2) institutional perspectives on uses of NSSE data; (3) observations of greater uses of NSSE data; and (4) NSSE data as a new source for communicating with important audiences.

One approach to easing the high school to college transition is to establish postsecondary enrollment options (PSEO) programs. Currently, 32 states have laws or recently have passed legislation to establish and govern PSEO programs. The benefits of such programs include that they provide more course options and offer more challenging courses to students during their last 1 or 2 years of high school. In addition, the programs decrease the cost of college by allowing high school students to get a head start on their coursework. There are a number of challenges associated with these programs, including student readiness, funding, and administration difficulties, as well as  the assertion by some that PSEO programs remove the top students from the high schools. The National Conference of State Legislatures conducted data on program components, focusing on eligibility, program structure, funding and financial aid, institutional accountability, and addition policies about PSEO programs. A look at recently introduced state legislation indicates that PSEO programs continue to be a widely used method in the United States to align K-12 and higher education systems more adequately and to ease the transition from high school to college. Eleven appendixes summarize state legislation in various areas in chart form. (SLD)",

        "description":"Concerns have been raised that adult undergraduates, those 24 and older, receive inadequate assistance in meeting the costs of postsecondary education, especially those who take one to five credits per term, or less than halftime. Less-than-halftime students are not eligible for the Stafford loan programs and are eligible to receive only one of the two federal higher education tax credits. In response to a Congressional inquiry, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) was asked to identify the extent to which adults enroll less than halftime, the extent to which such students receive federal, state, and other assistance, and the implications of changing the Pell Grant Program to allow less-than-halftime students to count room and board costs and personal expenses in their  applications for financial aid and changing the Stafford loan programs to allow their participation. GAO found that in the 1999-2000 school year, 2.3 million adults enrolled in undergraduate education on a less-than-halftime basis. Three of four such students expect to complete a degree or certificate program, but most leave school without completing one. About 70% of less-than-halftime students received some assistance, about 44% of their schooling costs, typically from sources other than state and federal aid. The GAO estimated, using data from various sources, that proposed changes to the Pell Grant system would cost the federal government a minimum of $25 million for the 2003-2004 school year. Allowing less-than-halftime students to participate in Stafford loans would cost about $113  million per year. College administrators expressed reservations about expanding Stafford Loan eligibility because of concerns about increasing default rates. Costs of expanding these programs may outweigh their potential benefits. Five appendixes contain supplemental and background information. (Contains 32 tables.) (SLD)",

The survey studied public knowledge of and perceptions about the challenges facing high school students, including low-income and minority groups, trying to move on to college and succeed once they are there. The study also gauged public opinion about various policy options to improve the system so that more students move successfully from high school and on to and through college. The national survey, which was conducted in fall 2003, included 1,010 U.S. citizens aged 18 and older, with oversampling of African Americans and Hispanics. Most respondents believed that high schools need improvement, and almost half believe major changes are needed.  More than half of those surveyed believed that the secondary and postsecondary systems do not work well together, and that better coordination is needed to help students move successfully from high school into and through college. Most Americans realize how few students who begin high school will eventually complete college. There is near universal agreement that the large numbers of students who do not earn college degrees is a problem for the United States. Americans believe that cost is the primary impediment for students, especially lower income students, in pursuit of a degree. Majorities believe increasing financial aid would help more students complete their degrees, but a majority agrees that cost is not the only obstacle. They want to see high schools do a better job and to see  better teachers in the schools. Americans are divided about the best way to increase the number of minority students who go to college succeed once they are there.

Data were collected through a Web-based data collection system from postsecondary institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Participation in IPEDS is a requirement for most institutions that participated in Title IV federal student financial aid programs in the 2001-2002 academic year. In 2001-2002, 4,143 institutions were required to complete the IPEDS salaries component, and 4,990 Title IV institutions were required to complete the fall staff and salaries  components. In fall 2001, Title IV institutions employed more than 3.1 million individuals. Two-thirds were employed full time, and 53% were women. Faculty constituted 36% if all employees, other professional staff accounted for 33%, and the remaining 31% were nonprofessional staff. Similar patterns were observed at public and private not-for-profit institutions. About 55% of faculty were full-time. In the 2001-2002 academic year, full-time instructional faculty on 9/10 month contracts earned an average salary of about $60,000 , and full-time instructional faculty on 11/12 month contracts earned an average salary of about $67,000. As expected, salaries varied by rank and gender, with faculty holding higher ranks earning higher average salaries. In general, men earned higher average  salaries than women, regardless of contract length or rank. (Contains 41 tables.) (SLD)",

The report can help states analyze their strengths and weaknesses and evaluate their progress through the snapshot it provides. The \"Measuring Up\" report grades six performance categories: (1) preparation; (2) participation; (3) affordability; (4) completion; (5) benefits; and (6) learning. In \"Measuring Up, 2002\" each state is given an \"I\" (incomplete) in Learning because there are no good data with which to measure learning at present. Other information is arranged as report cards for the states. How to use the report cards is  discussed. It is noted that since \"Measuring Up\" began in 2000, 30 states have improved in preparation and comparable numbers in other categories, with 49 states improving in affordability. (SLD)",

        "description":"This study is an outgrowth of recommendations made in a report issued by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) in 2001 (Nichols and Smith 2001). The report made three broad recommendations for addressing print preservation: (1) Establish regional repositories to house and provide proper treatment of low-use print matter drawn from various collections; (2) Investigate the establishment of archival repositories that would retain a &quot;last, best copy&quot; of American imprints; (3) Build interinstitutional networks for information sharing about the status of artifacts and delegation of responsibilities for caring for them. This report examined how, and to what degree, various consortia and university systems are using repositories to move beyond the immediate goal of  providing cost-effective collection storage and delivery and to be-gin to cooperatively manage and preserve their research collections. The report also suggests which practices, policies, and programs best foster the equitable sharing of the costs of collections care and to identify which practices and organizational and financial structures best support the integration of cooperative collection development and preservation efforts. Finally, it explores the extent to which the repositories studied represent an emerging architecture of broader cooperation, whereby the participating libraries might move beyond serving their regional communities and participate in a national network for cooperative preservation. A further purpose of this study was to appraise prospects for further  rationalization of libraries' efforts to manage the growing print corpus in institutions across the nation. Appendixes include four tables and brief overviews of the Australian National Collections Storage Program, national collections planning in the United Kingdom, and a Collaborative Academic Library Store for Scotland; and information on methodology and sources for the study.

The purpose of the survey was to identify the scope, financing, organizational structure, and sustainability of DCHIs. To gain a funder's perspective on these initiatives, the survey also included a few public and private funding organizations that support projects with a digital cultural heritage component. Thirty-three organization or projects and five funding agencies or foundations were included in the survey. The findings outlined throughout this report identify concerns about the current status and tenuous state of many digital cultural initiatives. These findings, in concert with the recommendations  proposed, offer a blueprint for those exploring appropriate strategies to support and strengthen digital cultural initiatives. The number and diversity of issues that affect DCHIs and jeopardize their future warrant a coordinated and consensus-driven approach to the problem. The report consists of five parts: background; review of Digital Cultural Heritage Initiatives; review of funders of Digital Cultural Heritage Initiatives; recommendations; and summary. Appendixes include a list of participating organizations and contacts; CLIR survey for DCHIs; CLIR survey for organizations funding DCHIs. (AEF)",

The original survey looked at educational activities museums provided schools for 1995. Where possible, comparisons are reported between the two studies to show trends. Findings of this survey, which included 376 valid responses, revealed that: museums of all types and all sizes offer educational programs; cumulatively, museums spent over a billion dollars on K-12 educational programs in 2000-01, and provided millions of instructional  hours; museums offer a wide range of learning activities that include not only visits, but pre- and post-visit services to students and teachers; resource kits and traveling exhibits, Web-based experiences and curricula, and in-service teacher training; museums serve students in all grades and in all regions of the nation, from inner cities to rural and suburban communities; museum teaching methods, curriculum fit, and resource materials are likely to be important influencers in a school's decision to partner with a museum, as are cost and convenience; partnerships use support and expertise from both institutions; museums provide many education programs specifically designed to support school curriculum standards and learning objectives; and most museums report that the number of  students, teachers, and schools they serve has continued to increase since about 1991.

Goals of McRAH (Model Collaboration: Rethinking American History) are to (1) raise student achievement and engagement by improving teachers' knowledge, understanding, teaching strategies, and appreciation of American history and (2) develop, evaluate, and disseminate a high quality, cohesive model of inservice professional development for grade 6-12 American history teachers, including collaboration with history professors and teacher educators at scholarly institutions. McRAH was precisely tailored to the needs of participating teachers based on work with the  first cohort of fellows. Planners determined that teachers needed professional development to improve instruction, raise student achievement and engagement, and improve teacher status and engagement. Data gathered before and after the summer institute indicated that pre-intervention, teachers' practices were heavily teacher-centered, lecture-based, and focused on covering and retaining factual material. However, the institute successfully met teachers' concerns and needs, with teachers becoming more student-centered and reflective. Six appendixes include the McRAH grant table B (participant activities), McRAH grant table A (McRAH design); phase one needs assessment; McRAH strategies; McRAH Peer Observation Team Observation/Conversation Strategy Checklist; and participant survey on use and  concerns regarding McRAH strategies.

This paper explores and evaluates the development of a methodology for conducting electronic focus groups to evaluate student experiences in distance learning. Researchers are beginning to understand that using Web-based technologies augments the benefits of focus group methods. Electronic focus groups will allow participants to discuss and interact through a medium that is a part of their  online learning environment. The benefits realized during the course of the two online focus group projects included lack of participant apprehension to communicate thoughts and the ability to discuss difficult topics. An additional benefit that has not been noted in previous research was the depth of discussion following participant agreement with other focus group members' comments. (Author/AEF)",

        "author":["Perrault, Anna H."],
        "description":"In 2001, WorldCat, the primary international bibliographic utility, contained 45 million records with over 750 million library location listings. These records span over 4,000 years of recorded knowledge in 377 languages. Under the auspices of an OCLC/ALISE (Online Computer Library Center/Association of Library and Information Science Educators) research grant, a bibliometric study was conducted of WorldCat. A 10% systematic random sample of the database was analyzed utilizing the OCLC iCAS product to profile the monographic bibliographic records in WorldCat by type of library, subject, language, and publication date parameters. The profile details the information commons of global publication made accessible through the OCLC international network. There were 3,378,272 usable  records from the 10% systematic random sample of which 2,199,165 records had call numbers and could be analyzed by subject. Five types of library groupings were established for the study: research, academic, public, special, and school. The research libraries grouping has the largest number or records in the sample with call numbers at 1,745,034. The missions of the different types of libraries can be discerned in the subject profiles for each library grouping. Among the findings of the study are that the profile of WorldCat by time period and by subject divisions is mirrored in the profile of the grouping of research libraries. Of all of the records in the 10% sample, approximately 65% are English language materials with 35% for foreign language materials. The analysis by number of  unique records and title overlap demonstrate that the universe of materials under bibliographic control in WorldCat shows a high level of diversity of resources with 53% of records having only one library location symbol. The number of records in the analysis show a sharp decline by most measures from 1992 to the last imprint year in the study. An analysis was performed of the records in the sample with ISBN numbers, finding that only 21% of the 3 million plus records in the study had ISBN numbers. This can be due to the amount of retrospective titles published before the numbering system came into use and also the number of publications that are not from mainstream publishers. But for publications since 1970, 57% of all records with call numbers have ISBN numbers, leaving an intriguing  43% of records with call numbers that do not have ISBN numbers. The findings establish that WorldCat is a rich resource for cataloging records, verification of the existence of titles, and identifying prospective materials for resources sharing. As OCLC continues to implement its Global Strategy, Extending the Cooperative, the number of international members and thus foreign language records and unique titles may continue to increase.

The legalities and background of software piracy are explained and true court cases are briefly examined. Discussion then focuses on explaining why individuals and organizations pirate software. The controversy of software piracy is examined through a cost benefit analysis. The two major stakeholders include the school district and the employees. The study investigates the pros and cons of pirating software from each stakeholder's point of view along with the probability of importance and occurrence. The final section of this report provides information on how to prevent software piracy. A table at the end of the document  provides a quick reference table for analyzing piracy in education, providing information on stakeholder; power; costs of pirating, with probability of importance and probability of occurrence; and benefits of pirating, with probability of importance and probability of occurrence.

        "description":"This study took place in a sixth grade math class at Webber Middle School in Saginaw, Michigan. A literature review indicated that a classroom that students perceive as safe, supportive of their autonomy, and of their learning increases intrinsic motivation. With this in mind, the author created a study, which would look for connections between positive, non-controlling feedback and students' views of the classroom as a safe learning environment followed by evidence of an increase in intrinsic motivation. The study further examined whether allowing choice in assignments would increase intrinsic motivation as evidenced by an increase in completed assignments, completed portfolios and an increase in a desire to complete assignments. And finally, it explored whether sharing the  content standards and benchmarks with students and asking them to write their own goals, thus supporting autonomy, would increase students' learning and intrinsic motivation as evidenced by pre- and post-tests and a self-assessment of their desire to learn. Appendixes include: the letter indicating completion (to be inserted); student journal form; tally sheet for classroom observation of student active involvement; student classroom environment survey; tally sheet of teacher feedback; tally sheet for completed assignments, extra credit assignments and portfolios; interest inventory--assignment choice; student self-assessment of desire to learn; tally sheet of correct answers for pre- and post-tests; and tally sheet for goals set and goal completion; (Contains 13 references.)

If marketing is promoting an individual library to increase public use, advocacy is broadcasting the purpose of libraries and the role of the librarian to garner public support. The issue of image of must be confronted, a professional image that has been diminished by insufficient salaries and a stereotyped image that is maintained by popular culture. Libraries and librarians can position themselves through marketing, including developing a public library Web site and designing promotional materials or using ready-made materials available through sources such as the American Library Association's (ALA's) Public Information Office. Librarians can get help  in marketing by participating in large-scale advocacy efforts such as ALA's Campaign for America's Libraries, known by its familiar \"@ Your Library\" trademark; state libraries, public libraries, and ALA chapters have created marketing slogans by customizing the \"@ Your Library\" logo. In addition to developing partnerships, the following tasks can be added to the \"how-to list\" for marketing libraries and librarians: share stories of successes; announce needs by sharing bad news along with the good; create a better online presence; see each day as an opportunity to not only tell the public what you do and who you are; and market libraries by marketing yourself.

The review was conducted with the intention of providing a clear and accessible synthesis of existing research to inform subsequent strategic action and research directions in an Australian context. This report is based on a critical desktop review, which looked at a range of studies both overseas and in Australia since 1990,  including earlier overviews of the research. In general, the literature confirms the need for local, evidence-based practice if the roles of the school library and teacher librarian in student learning are to be valued in the way that the research suggests they should be valued. Such research is an important strategic tool for raising the profile and prestige of library professionals and for reinforcing in the minds of policy-makers and school communities the crucial contribution that school libraries can make to student achievement.

It presents the panel members' conclusions about existing research and their recommendations on what kinds of further work are needed. Research on how exit exams affect dropout rates is limited and inconclusive, so policies continue to be made in the absence of good information about the consequences for students and society. Most of the paper focuses on the paucity of research as it offer recommendations for further research, including longitudinal studies. The paper does, however, recap some research on dropouts that focused on the underlying reasons for dropping out. The paper concludes with the following recommendations for policymakers to support better information and practices on  the potential costs and benefits of exit exams: (1) Report more informative exit-exam results; (2) improve data systems; (3) provide incentives for accurate recordkeeping; (4) keep historical records; (5) consider menus of policies; and (6) support success.

This report catalogs and summarizes recommendations made between 1992 and 2000 to the 11 federal agencies that were subject to the original examinations. In evaluating federal agencies' civil-rights enforcement programs in the 1990s, the commission identified the following elements for effective civil-rights enforcement: (1) a high priority for civil-rights enforcement; (2) an organizational structure that expresses the priority of civil rights; (3) planned  civil-rights goals and activities; (4) clear and pertinent policy guidance, current regulations, technical assistance, education, and outreach; (5) effective complaint processing systems; (6) systems to ensure review of all funding recipients' compliance before and after awards are made and to correct deficiencies; and (7) regular staff training on civil-rights statutes and emerging issues. This report also includes strategies for effective civil-rights enforcement, descriptions of the enforcement reports, key civil-rights statues and regulations, and a checklist for evaluating federal agencies' civil-rights enforcement.

        "description":"Several trends in education are affecting administrators on a daily basis. This paper attempts to heighten understanding of a few of the current trends in administration. The first trend that is increasingly coming to the forefront is the lack of personnel willing to pursue a career in administration. Personnel in schools are not willing to take on the job of administration due to the lack of control, high stress level, and what is perceived as inadequate compensation for the job. Another trend is the number of administrators leaving their current positions. They do not want the added responsibility that has come with school accountability. If these trends continue, there will be a severe shortage of administrators in the next few years. The question we must now ask is why.  Another trend is the changing role of administrators. While no school should become stagnant, administrators are constantly confronting additional responsibilities. The roles of administrators are now as diverse as the administrators themselves. Administration and the trends affecting it are changing with the times. Hopefully, we will be able to fill the administrator positions in the future with qualified candidates. (Author/WFA)",

Matrix sampling involves developing a complete set of items judged to cover the curriculum, then dividing the items into subsets and administering one subset to each student. Matrix sampling, by limiting the number of items administered to each student, limits the amount of testing time required, while still providing, across students, coverage of a broad range of content. As state or provincial testing officials consider using matrix sampling, they must recognize that every test design, whether or not it involves a matrixed component, carries with it certain costs. The choice of design requires careful consideration of these costs, and every  design represents a compromise in terms of one or more costs. (SLD)",

        "description":"This Digest defines student engagement and describes various methods used to measure it, both in empirical research studies and at the classroom level. Student engagement has been defined in various ways, but it is evident that students who are engaged show sustained behavioral involvement in learning activities accompanied by a positive emotional tone. The use of metacognitive strategies may be taken to indicate active task engagement, while the use of shallow strategies may be taken to indicate superficial engagement. The most common way that student engagement is measured is through information reported by students themselves. A few studies have used summative rating scales to measure student engagement levels. These may include teacher report scales. Evidence of higher-order  problem solving and metacognitive learning strategies may be gathered form sources such as student projects, portfolios, performances, and other demonstrations. The efficacy of these methods depends on the use of suitably structured tasks and scoring rubrics. Focused case studies can collect detailed descriptive accounts of engagement rates. Teachers interested in assessing student engagement in the classroom should consider using separate measures to get at cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of task engagement.

Nearly half of the schools nationwide that offer IB courses are in SREB states. In SREB states the number of students who take AP exams has more than doubled since 1992. More minority students are taking AP courses in SREB states than before, and the numbers of minority and majority students taking IB courses in SREB states has increased. As more students take AP courses, the passing rates typically decrease. This has been  the case in SREB states as well, but more than one-third of white students, one-third of Hispanic students, and one-half of black students who passed AP courses nationwide lived in SREB states.

Program topics included utilization-focused evaluation, the programs theory of action, evaluation designs, assessment methods, data analysis, and reporting results. While enrolled in this year-long program, all participants conducted a wide range of evaluation activities in their organizations drawing on what they had learned. At each session they shared their progress with fellow participants, provided  feedback to each other, and sought instructors' guidance. This active and collaborative learning allowed them to develop a better understanding of key concepts, principles, and methods in the context of their work. They gave uniformly high ratings to the program (4.5 to 5.0 on a five-point scale). These high ratings were confirmed by their enthusiasm and engagement throughout the program, by the high rate of attendance at each session, by the positive tone of response to the open-ended questions, and by their openness in sharing their work with each other.

        "description":"This document comments on the future of educational testing in the United States and the plans of the Bush administration for increased use of testing for educational accountability. The &quot;achievement gap&quot; does not appear to be closing. One of the keys to closing the gap is having the data to understand it so that teachers can use test results appropriately. The president's plan calls for school-by-school report cards with mathematics and reading tests broken down by ethnicity, gender, disability, and English proficiency. Sanctions and rewards based on closing achievement gaps and improving English proficiency can help, but creating an accountability system does not automatically produce a productive learning environment. The rewards/sanctions system needs to be planned carefully  to avoid being trivial, counterproductive, or corrupted. President Bush's plans require testing some 22 million students in grades 3 through 8 each year in reading and mathematics. The plan also requires that such tests be aligned with the state's academic standards. To accomplish this, a major test creation and administration effort will be required in a number of states. This is doable given sufficient time and resources. Any testing program, however, is only as good as the weakest link in the process. The stakes are high, and it is essential that test developers implement safeguards established by the assessment profession. The president's testing program should go forward, but it should be done right. Recommendations are made to bring this about. (SLD)",

Specific early literacy assessment instruments and instructional approaches are not suggested. Instead, the report focuses on some of the essential elements of an assessment system intended to monitor the progress of young children's literacy development. A useful assessment system requires multiple literacy assessments and the coherent use of an array of instruments consisting of screening, diagnostic, and classroom-based instruments to inform instructional practice and evaluate program effectiveness. An effective system also requires strong and stable leadership, with solid administrative support for well-prepared teachers. Coherent professional  development programs are a final component of a useful assessment system. Well-trained and reflective teachers must understand cognitive and literacy development and the basic concepts of appropriate assessment. The financial resources being allocated to literacy testing will only be useful to children and teachers if the critical roles of multiple forms of assessment is recognized and system wide changes are made to incorporate professional development for teachers and administrators.

In partnership with Mills College, the Consortium on Chicago School Research designed a short-term, interview-based study to provide a snapshot of these new small schools in their first year of planning and implementation. Principals or directors were interviewed at the five small schools, and principals were interviewed in the three host schools. Three program staff members and 50% of the teachers were interviewed, and focus groups were held with groups of 5 to 10 students. Question and answer sessions were held with parents at two small schools. Findings show that the level of student-teacher personalism increased, and teacher professional  community was strengthened in at least four of the small schools. Small school staff members reported that the focus on instruction was limited in year one, and participants reported implementation challenges. The current and future relationships between small schools and the host school were not clearly defined, but overall there was a sense of optimism and commitment for the next year. (SLD)",

To have an impact, this information needs to be presented on the publics terms. This report contains data on recent public opinion about education issues, gathered from several polls conducted by national organizations. Graphs show that improving schools is a top priority, and that the public generally agrees that change is needed. There is strong support for the reforms in the new federal law, especially for requiring teachers to be licensed in the subjects they teach. There is strong support for closing the achievement gap, but most attribute the gap to factors outside school walls. The public strongly supports standards and accountability,  but support for testing has limits. Testing in moderation is supported, and using test scores in addition to teacher evaluations receives public support. The public generally believes that education should be protected from budget cuts, and support for education outweighs support for all other spending priorities combined. Teacher support for standards, testing, and accountability is waning, in comparison with 1999 findings. Teachers think parent involvement and lack of discipline are top problems facing schools. Students take learning seriously, but feel that too much emphasis is placed on test scores. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)",

Its major aim has been to demonstrate that an invariant formulation of the Agent-action-Objective model and an analysis of it's a-O kinematics have the capacity to reproduce contour similarity over time. Within the studied evolutionary-developmental context, the biokinetics of the discovered AaO-mechanism has governed the synthesizing of information. Through the design of a single-subject experiment, it has been possible to demonstrate individual variations in growth as changes in complexity. When the two participating students are compared, obvious differences in their perspectives and consequently in their attractor spaces  become apparent. Based on coordinated structural invariance, it has been possible to show that the convoluted spaces of the student who has followed the analytic-descriptive approach is concerned with the concrete level of the tested story. On the other hand, the student who is following a synthetic-reflective strategy seems to concentrate mainly on the symbolic level of the tested materials. Thus, from a developmental point of view, it has been possible to demonstrate that the AaO-mechanism is tracing embodied growth, which becomes manifest in the differences of the students' ability to adapt to the main idea of the given story.

The emphasis of the main hypothesis of this experiment has been put on the students ability to adapt to the main idea of a given story and to express his comprehension verbally. The way the two students of the previous two experiments have been able to accomplish the experimental task is reflected in the state attractors of the produced fitness landscapes. The student who has continued to follow the analytic-descriptive approach has focused on the conditions of that part of the study that relates to a critic of empiricism. Since it has been shown that the process of naming the resulting state attractors provides a sound theoretical basis, it can  be concluded that the student has not been conscious of this purpose and consequently has been unable to abstract the criticism of empiricism. In contrast, the other student has continued to follow the synthetic-reflective approach. The produced narrative has made it evident that this student has been able to abstract the criticism of idealism. It follows that the proper outcome is &quot;rationalism,&quot; which is validating that the degree of developed competence can be approached in a direct and obvious manner. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Jean Piaget's classic theory of cognitive development would imply that the higher-order items on the Kentucky state assessment would only be possible for students well into concrete operations or beginning formal operations. The implication would be that Kentucky fourth graders who are not fully concrete yet may be hitting a developmental ceiling on the state assessment. In the week following state testing in spring 2003, 87% (n=47) of the total fourth grade at one Kentucky elementary school was tested with the Piaget conservations tasks for number, liquid, mass, and area, and tasks involving group classification and class inclusion. Fewer than half the students passed all the conservation and classification tasks, and nearly 20% missed two to six tasks each. About 28% of the  total were also in transition to formal thought. This fourth grade clearly had a wide range of cognitive developmental levels that may have an impact on the school's standing on the state assessment. (Contains 4 tables and 12 references.) (SLD)",

The testing conditions studied were: independent, cheat sheet, homogenous grouping with cheat sheet, and heterogeneous group without cheat sheet. Participants were 141 undergraduates in a course required for entry into the teacher education program at a regional state university. Five tests were given over the course. The first two were given in traditional fashion (independent work), and the others each embodied one of the testing conditions. Heterogeneous group discussion resulted in the highest average test score. All the alternative formats resulted in higher scores than students earned in the traditional individual format. Additional research is necessary to  determine why the homogeneous group discussions resulted in the highest scores, but it may be that thinking together is powerful scaffolding for dealing with the mechanics of testing.

Results of one study indicate that the use of the writing portfolio did not improve the writing skills of Kentucky high school graduates. Data from the Kentucky Department of Education and the National Assessment of Educational Progress do indicate that Kentucky students are improving at all grade levels. CATS data show improvements, but many are skeptical for reasons of possible test bias and questions of test validity. Measuring the success of educational reform in Kentucky is nearly impossible.

        "author":["Gardner, Yun Hui"],
        "description":"Recent research has revealed the efficacy of cognitive behavioral interventions with sexual abuse survivors. Cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) interventions require trauma survivors to confront their painful memories directly. This allows for assessment of cognitive distortions that need to be challenged and reframed. The extent and amount of confronting, or re-exposing the survivor to the traumatic memories is often a delicate and controversial issue. A common question in therapy with sexual abuse survivors is whether to expose or not expose the survivor to the traumatic events in order for healing to take place. This paper provides a rationale for the efficacy of using exposure-based CBT in treating adult sexual abuse survivors. A brief overview of CBT methods will be  presented. (Contains 15 references.)

The Group Support System (an electronic meeting system; GSS) was used to collect qualitative data and a paper-and-pencil survey was used to collect quantitative data from 110 candidates as they completed student teaching. Descriptive statistics from the analyses were compared. Results from the GSS data analysis found that 36 different technologies were used during student teaching. PowerPoint presentation software (n=57) and Internet )n=49) were the most frequently  used. Ninety-one percent of the student teachers stated that using technology increased student learning in their classrooms. Through quantitative analysis, competency levels using different technologies were identified. Qualitative analysis also identified areas for future training. Both National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and National Teacher Standards require new teachers to have technology competencies.

Teachers rated the level of assertiveness skills that students exhibited when confronted by other students. After the establishment of baseline skills, group counseling sessions were conducted twice a week for 3 weeks according to an adapted PBL model. Students identified a common problem they wanted to resolve. They then made a list of facts and asked open-ended questions concerning the problem. They held a discussion about each question, formed hypotheses, identified counseling  issues, and listed resources. Student assertiveness skills were measured after the intervention, and findings indicate that treatment using the PBL methodology was effective in increasing assertiveness skills.

        "description":"This study examined the effectiveness of using selected self-report measures assessing motivational orientation, learning strategies, procrastination, and perceptions of daily hassles to facilitate the prediction of final examination grades in a self-paced introductory psychology course. Four surveys purporting to measure the constructs were chosen, and a demographic survey was also administered. The course used a local area network of personal computers to administer all materials and to collect data for each participant. Students agreeing to participate in the study were administered the surveys during the first three class sessions of the semester. The course was self-paced, with students determining their rate of engagement. A criterion level of accumulated points determined  course letter grade and course completion. Data were collected on 149 students, 122 of whom completed the course. The final examination was given in two segments. Part 1 covered core modules that all students were required to master during the course of the semester before they attempted additional modules. Part 2 covered additional modules. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy for learning and performance was positively related to grades on part 1 of the final examination. Results suggest that self-efficacy contributes to student performance. Implications for early interventions to improve student self-efficacy and achievement are discussed.

The standards, developed by a broad-based group of individuals whose backgrounds represent the many facets of the Missouri early childhood community, provide broad descriptions of what most children should know and be able to do by the time they enter kindergarten and represent a shared set of expectations for preschoolers in the field of mathematics. The standards publication delineates the Missouri prekindergarten guiding principles and presents process standards, indicators of competency  development, and examples of behaviors children may exhibit in their mathematical development in the following areas: (1) number and operations; (2) geometry and spatial sense; (3) patterns and relationship; (4) measurement; and (5) exploring data. The teacher's guide explains the standards and offers practical suggestions for creating engaging, developmentally appropriate learning communities that foster each child's mathematical thinking. The guide includes definitions of the mathematical concepts used in the standards, suggested teaching strategies for each standard area, suggestions for involving parents and families, and a 62-item resource list of books, websites, magazines, and other materials. The parent handbook introduces the mathematics standards, defines mathematical terms,  provides information on how a child may exhibit progress toward a particular standard or goal, and offers suggestions for parental support of mathematical development. The handbook closes with a list of general tips for parents, an 11-item bibliography, and a list of 63 books for young children incorporating mathematical concepts. (KB)",

This document describes and examines various funding sources used when making decisions about possible early childhood initiatives combined with policy choices that may be considered in times of fiscal stress. The report highlights a range of funding and policy approaches for legislators and other policymakers to consider when developing a law, policy, or budget action. The report further outlines strategic fiscal and policy questions. The sources of funding for early care and education include: (1) federal funds (Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Head Start, Early Head Start, Child  and Adult Care Food Program, Social Services Block Grant, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act); (2) state funds (general fund appropriations, tobacco settlement revenues, special taxes, family leave revenue sources, business tax credits, loans and grants, lotteries, gaming revenues, and special fees); (3) local sources (financial match or in-kind donations); and (4) philanthropic foundations. Next, policy choices are examined related to selecting a legislative focus; coordinating programs and funds; addressing program quality through teacher education and training, accreditation, or other standards; addressing the supply of early education programs; making choices within the child care subsidy system related to eligibility, copayments, and reimbursement rates; and investing in  prekindergarten programs. Issues to consider in early childhood education policy are then delineated. The report concludes with key resource information designed to aid in the development of legislative proposals.

This study surveyed children in the Glasgow area nearing the end of primary education and those just beginning their secondary education regarding their experiences with the transition to secondary school. Survey findings were supplemented with information obtained through a small number of focus group discussions and data obtained from teachers and school records. Findings suggested that most children coped well with the move and were positive about preparation programs. There were indications that more children of minority ethnic backgrounds  than white children encountered more difficulties and disappointments in their adjustment to secondary school. Primary school teachers' predictions about how well individual students would manage the social and environmental aspects of the transition corresponded well with the actual experiences that the child later reported. Education policy and school practice implications include making slight modifications to existing transition preparation programs, paying additional attention to transition problems as secondary students adjust to their new placement, and giving particular attention to assisting pupils of minority ethnic backgrounds.

The most significant findings cited in the study are as follows: (1) children six and under spend an average of 2 hours daily with screen media, mostly TV and videos; (2) TV watching begins at very early ages, well before the medical community recommends; (3) a high proportion of very young children are using new digital media, including 50 percent of 4- to 6-year-olds who have played video games and 70 percent who have used computers; (4)  two out of three 6-year-olds and under live in homes where the TV is left on at least half the time, even without viewers present, and one-third live in homes where the TV is on &quot;almost all&quot; or &quot;most&quot; of the time-- children in the latter group appear to read less than other children and to be slower to learn to read; (5) many parents see media as an important educational tool, beneficial to their children's intellectual development, and parents' attitudes on this issue appear to be related to the amount of time their children spend using each medium; and (6) parents clearly perceive that their children's TV watching has a direct effect on their behavior, and are more likely to see positive rather than negative behaviors being copied.

        "description":"This evaluation study examined changes in school readiness among 35 children who participated during the 2002-2003 fiscal year in two programs: (1) Project Family Read, an educational and parent education program operating during the school year for families of children not enrolled in regulated child care in Granville County, North Carolina; and (2) Kinder Camp, a more focused summer readiness program for children from Project Family Read who entered kindergarten in August. Both programs are supported through Smart Start funds. The measure of school readiness was the Cognitive/Language Profile of the Early Screening Profiles. Pretests were given soon after children's entry into Project Family Read, and posttests were given during the final week of Kinder Camp. Children's scores  were converted into age equivalents (AE) for comparison with the children's chronological ages (CA). Results indicated that the average pretest AE was approximately 55 months, almost equivalent to the average CA at the time. The average posttest AE was approximately 70 months, in comparison to the average CA of about 63 months. Every child made a gain in AE score on the Cognitive/Language Profile. The results were consistent with those obtained in two previous years in which the average gain in AE scores was approximately double the change in CA between the children's entrance to Project Family Read and the end of Kinder Camp. The findings reinforce the conclusion that Project Family Read and Kinder Camp are effective in improving the readiness of children for kindergarten.  (KB)",

Based on the draft developed by this committee, this standards guide is designed to assist administrators, teachers, and parents in developing high quality early childhood education programs for children and assist local administrators in their efforts to implement the state mandates for the Core Curriculum. The outcomes recommended elaborate on the Model Core Curriculum Outcomes, with specific emphasis on early childhood developmentally appropriate practices. Critical program components are presented as distinct areas for which standards have been established,  used to define quality, and recognized as determinants of expected program outcomes. The critical components are: (1) statement of philosophy; (2) accountability; (3) coordination, cooperation, and program support, including funding, instructional staff, and administrative/supervisory personnel; (4) family and community collaboration; (5) child development; (6) curriculum, including climate and strategies and content areas; and (7) assessment and evaluation of program goals and learner outcomes. The content areas of the curriculum are: (1) cognitive development; (2) mathematics; (3) science; (4) creative arts; (5) language arts; (6) physical development; (7) health, nutrition, and safety; (8) social and emotional development; and (9) social studies. Within the first five critical  components and the climate and strategies area of the curriculum component, standards are delineated with accompanying criterion, quality indicators, and supporting references. Included within the content areas of the curriculum component are learner outcomes, indicators, suggested instructional strategies, and relevant references. The assessment and evaluation of program goals and learning outcomes component includes standards, indicators, suggested strategies, and supporting references.

Both degrees socialize students into a profession based in service, that enjoys autonomy, and that is grounded in a knowledge base. However, the Ed.D. prepares administrators for professional practice through a practical curriculum, and the Ph.D. concentrates on training faculty and researchers. The ideal is a clear difference between the two degrees, with the Ed.D. training researching professionals and the Ph.D. training professional researchers. This distinction, however, has long been a fiction across U.S. higher education programs. The focus of this essay is that most higher education programs err by using the Ph.D. to prepare administrators, either by preparing them through the wrong means or by labeling  Ed.D. training as the Ph.D. Drawing real distinctions between the two degrees is a necessary starting point to move education closer to other professional fields. Ed.D. programs can be more nontraditional and can use new formats that serve students better. The Ed.D. lends itself to the case method, as in law and medicine, and thus to innovation in teaching. Steps toward differentiating the two degrees have been taken at the University of Pennsylvania. In essence, that university has addressed the issue of inputs in differentiating between the two programs, but concerns related to process and outcomes remain. (Contains 37 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"In spite of almost 30 years of judicial and federal agency interpretation, the issues facing colleges and universities with respect to students with disabilities have become increasingly complex, in part because of the increasing number of college-ready students with disabilities and the expectations they bring to higher education. Many such students do not understand that educators in K-12 have very different obligations than those in higher education. Colleges only have an obligation to ensure that qualified applicants and students with disabilities have access to the colleges program and are provided necessary academic adjustments, including auxiliary aids and services. The burden is on the student to make known the disability and to provide and pay for appropriate  documentation in a timely manner. The institution, unlike K-12 education, is not required to provide programming, such as specialized tutoring. High schools are now required to counsel parents and students that the burden of identifying the students disability and needs shifts after high school. At the same time, college and university administrators need to be aware of student expectations. Higher education administrators would be wise to anticipate and avoid challenges resulting from students erroneous conceptions about the legal requirements of K-12 institutions compared with those of higher education institutions.

In 2001, nearly 106,000 students were enrolled in New Mexico's public colleges and universities. Most (54%) were studying on-campus, with the remainder taking courses at off-campus sites. Some 54% of on-campus students are enrolled in community colleges, but since many of these are part-time students, they represent only 44% of the full-time equivalent enrollment.  Eighty-seven percent of these enrolled students were New Mexico residents. In the 2000-2001 academic year, New Mexico's public colleges and universities awarded a slightly lower number of degrees (1%) than in 1999-2000; there were 5,405 bachelor's degrees awarded. On average, resident undergraduate students at the states three research universities paid nearly $3,100 in tuition and fees per academic year, and tuition at the three comprehensive universities averaged about $2,232. All six universities raised tuition in the academic year. Students received nearly $310 million in student financial assistance, and of this sum, more than $273 million was awarded from public funding sources. Instructional programs at New Mexico's public postsecondary institutions continue to receive significant  support from state funds, as detailed.

        "description":"Faculty gender ratios vary considerably across institutions, and past research has shown that certain characteristics of institutions have a significant effect on these gender ratios. Understanding the drivers of faculty gender ratio variation is important since the concentration of women in particular types of institutions contributes to gender differences in earnings, career patterns, and employment outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis, drawn from theories of organizational behavior, that gender ratios of assistant professors are influenced by employers' discriminatory preferences, the gendered composition of the student body, and women's preferences for employment in teaching versus research universities. In addition, it was hypothesized that public institutions and  institutions located in highly populated areas would have a greater proportion of female assistant professors. The explanatory variables suggested by the hypothesis were examined using cross-sectional data for 233 research and doctoral universities from two separate years, and a fixed-effects analysis was used to obtain unbiased estimates. Results support all of the hypotheses except for the preference of women for employment in teaching universities. This thesis also attempts to explain the variation in faculty gender ratios across economics departments. It was hypothesized that the departmental model would be more accurate than the institutional model since hiring decisions are made at the departmental level. The results, however, do not support this hypothesis. The implications for  future studies of interorganizational variation in faculty gender ratios are discussed. (Contains 13 references.)

        "description":"This study assessed the learning outcomes of students with disabilities who attended the \"New Student Orientation Program\" at California State University, Northridge in the fall 2003 semester. Forty-two students completed a locally developed pretest and posttest that contained 25 core questions. These questions covered the content areas of accommodation services provided, student advocacy, office location, and timelines to acquire accommodations. A comparison of the pretest scores to the posttest scores demonstrates that students' knowledge about the content increased by 12% overall. However, the students scored lower on the posttest in the five accommodation service areas. A \"freshman\" subgroup scored lower in three additional content areas. Further study is required to  determine the cause of this score discrepancy. A satisfaction survey was also part of the posttest. It indicated that 98% of the students were satisfied with the program. Although this rating is high, several program changes were recommended to ensure higher levels of learning. These included consistent use of language, more one-on-one program time, and ensuring that content areas are covered thoroughly. The pretest and posttest are attached. (Contains 21 references.)

        "description":"This paper describes and explores key parallels between college student retention theory and service-learning to better inform the practices of each. Service learning encompasses the various pedagogies that link community service and academic study so that each strengthens the other. It is a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities designed to promote student learning and development. Service learning is a good fit with the interactionalist theory of V. Tinto and theories of retention in general because it provides multiple, meaningful connections between students, faculty, and community in ways that allow for diversity. The bonds service learning can promote appear to  contribute to social integration. The paper presents 10 guidelines that combine what is known about service learning and retention to inform and extend both. As the guidelines are implemented, the key appears to be a provision of sound research that reinforces what appear to be logical connections between retention theory and service learning.

        "description":"This digest focuses on academic testing and American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students. Ideally, test results should be used to improve student learning. Proponents of high-stakes testing say it is needed to measure student achievement and school quality and to hold students and teachers accountable. High-stakes testing is also used to publicly compare schools and districts; to determine entrance into particular programs, schools, or colleges; as criteria for promotion or graduation; and to make decisions about resource allocation. Opponents of testing argue that current testing programs do not provide valid or reliable information, especially for low-income and minority students, and have unintended, negative consequences. Nationally, AI/AN students have scored well  below White and other minority groups of students on standardized tests of reading, language, and mathematics. Testing of AI/AN students has been a concern for years, as AI/AN cultures and languages were long considered obstacles to achievement, and the performance of White students was the benchmark for all. Standardized tests fail to consider the vast diversity of AI/AN languages and cultures, leading to serious issues regarding cultural bias, content comparability, norming of tests, and test validity. Other issues include environmental factors; student physical or emotional health; risk-taking behaviors of youth; and poorly funded, low-quality schools serving AI/AN students. Nine strategies are listed for improving test scores of special populations, including AI/AN students.  (SV)",

This demand, coupled with an environment of increased standards and shrinking budgets, is a major challenge to rural, small, and low-income schools. This digest reviews contemporary research on resource allocation issues in rural and small schools. Structural constraints that can complicate the resource allocation process for rural and small schools include fragmented school schedules; federal and state guidelines for curriculum offerings, teacher certification, and special services; inflexible job definitions for teachers; and specialized programs that may be peripheral to the academic mission. Meta-analyses and literature reviews have  shown a high level of inconsistency across studies of the cost-effectiveness of various educational investments such as class-size reduction and teacher salaries. Policymakers and school leaders may find guidance and support for meeting the challenges of resource allocation through creative reallocation of existing resources, consideration of successful whole-school reform models, and pursuit of nontraditional revenues and new funding streams targeted explicitly for rural, small, and low-income schools.

Native teachers enhance the teacher-student relationship for Native students, are role models for Native youth, and are aware of Native learning styles. The ongoing Native Educators Research Project, examining how language and culture are included in the education of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Hawaiian teachers, surveyed 238 students in 27 Native teacher preparation programs and interviewed program administrators. Although most programs articulated a focus on Native language and culture, course contents and requirements often did not reflect that intent. About half the respondents reported that they  spoke and understood their Native language and were knowledgeable about their Native culture. About a third could write in their Native language. Nearly all respondents felt that Native language and culture should be included in the schooling of Native children, but only about a quarter felt prepared to teach their Native language, English as a second language, or bilingual education. While more than half felt prepared to teach multicultural education, only about a quarter felt prepared to teach Native culture. Seventy percent of respondents felt prepared to use cooperative/group instructional strategies, but only 40 percent felt prepared in the area of Native learning styles. (TD)",

A comparison between 1982 and 1992 high school seniors found more completing some postsecondary credits (from 53 percent to 76 percent) and higher percentages completing degrees (from 27 percent completing an associate degree or higher to 29 percent completing a bachelors degree or higher). College offers a payoff in terms of lower unemployment and higher wages and the benefits increase with higher levels of education. An analysis of postsecondary technical certificates, academic and technical associate degrees and baccalaureate degrees shows that field of  study, gender, related employment and program completion all have different effects on employment outcomes. However, many students enter but do not complete college, often because of inadequate academic preparation in high school. Analysts agree that some postsecondary training is essential for success in the workplace and that appropriate academic preparation for college is critical. For students lacking the academic foundations, a technical certificate or associate degree may be a wiser investment than attempting but failing to complete a bachelors degree. (CG)",

Many teachers teach in the way they were taught which usually can be characterized as field independent (content oriented, formal teaching methods, less student involvement, structured class activities); a style that can work well with students who are field dependent (prefer structure and guidance from the teacher). When students' learning preferences match their instructor's teaching styles, student motivation and achievement usually improve, but some students may do better with a learning/teaching style mismatch. Learners need to become  better all-around learners by adapting their learning style to non-preferred teaching styles. Teachers can become more flexible by being willing to change their view of the role of students. The following five perspectives on teaching can help teachers to identify, articulate, and justify their teaching approaches: (1) transmission (focus on content, teacher directed); (2) developmental (values students' prior knowledge, directs students to develop more complex understandings); (3) apprenticeship (authentic tasks in real world settings); (4) nurturing (focus on interpersonal elements and students' emotional and intellectual needs); and (5) social reform (relate ideas explicitly to the lives of the students).

        "description":"The &quot;New Economy&quot; implies a society in which information/communication technology is changing the nature of the workplace and contributing to more efficient and productive practices geared toward improving the quality of products and services. Recent events such as the collapse of dot.coms and corporate scandals have led some to doubt that the promises were based on anything substantial. Do productivity gains support the promises of the New Economy? Although there are signs of economic recovery, many remain jobless, and some believe that the recent surge in consumer spending is temporary and is not accompanied by steady improvement in the labor market. Are companies positioning themselves for an economic rebound? There is evidence that some companies are changing production  practices and work organization, which some believe are signs of the New Economy. Does the New Economy demand a top-notch work force? Efficient and effective use of information technology and the capacity for lifelong learning are characteristics of the kinds of workers many employers now require. Are new technologies creating the most jobs? Some contend that the New Economy is not about job creation, but about the use of enhanced technology to perform work. Finally, the New Economy is characterized by the decentralization of economic power and opportunities. Portfolio careers and career resilience may be hallmarks of the New Economy's work force.

        "author":["Kerka, Sandra"],
        "description":"An evidence-based connection between adult educator professional development (PD) and learner outcomes is difficult to document, yet there is an intuitive assumption that professional development is linked to better teaching and learning outcomes. The field appears to be shifting away from one-shot PD to practitioner engagement in sustained, collaborative knowledge construction. PD workshops have many limitations, such as location, time, and costs. Single workshops may be a useful way to provide information and raise awareness of issues, but changes in behavior and practice require longer-term approaches. Collaborative practitioner inquiry/research is being used extensively in PD in adult basic education, and evaluations have demonstrated significant changes in practice. However,  such approaches are difficult to implement on a large scale, and their effects are subject to numerous other influences. Rather than asking which PD method or model is more effective, professional development should be considered a transformative process of critical reflection that leads to thinking and acting differently. How to demonstrate the impact of professional development on learning outcomes is in dispute. Using learner achievement as a measure is problematic, because factors associated with the practitioners, learners, programs, and PD system also influence outcomes. A more inclusive definition of PD and a broader conception of impact can help in assessing the effectiveness of professional development. (Contains 16 references.) (SK)",

        "description":"Is the positive potential of globalization being realized? Are transnational careers becoming a reality? What effects are uncertainty and continuous change having on career development? There is evidence that a growing number of companies are exporting both blue- and white-collar jobs overseas, although some contend that it is new technologies that have reduced the demand for more workers by increasing productivity. Some believe that jobs in fields where the level of expertise is high will remain in the United States. Workers who have high levels of education and skill may be more able to reap career benefits from global integration than those with only high school education or less. Lifelong learning is touted as a key to employability. Globalization's effects may be seen in  increasingly lateral career paths, work that is increasingly portfolio centered rather than position centered, and an increase in contingent and temporary employment. Besides educational attainment and occupational proficiency, employment in a globalized world will require understanding and appreciation of a wide variety of cultures and the ability to work cooperatively and collaboratively in teams and across cultures.

        "author":["Imel, Susan"],
        "description":"Workplace literacy was the focus of attention during the era of the National Workplace Literacy Program (NWLP), funded by the U.S. Department of Education from 1988-1996. Since then, it has not disappeared, in part because recent legislation such as the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and Welfare Reform Act has increased the work-related focus of adult basic and literacy education. At the national level, projects such as the National Institute for Literacy's Equipped for the Future are signs of continued federal attention to workplace literacy. Much of the leadership now resides at the state level. At the local level are WIA and union-funded programs. What is missing, however, is leadership and support from policy makers and funders. During the NWLP era, two instrumental  assumptions were as follows: (1) a direct relationship exists between inadequate basic skills and economic problems and (2) the functional context approach is the most effective way of improving basic skills. However, assumptions about the relationship between individual skills and the economy tend to overlook such factors as globalization, how organizations structure work, and social and economic policies. Alternatives to functional context such as participatory and sociocultural approaches are being advocated. Since NWLP ended, there is still a great deal of workplace literacy activity, and adult educators are still dealing with many of the same issues. (Contains 14 references.) (SK)",

        "description":"Work-based learning (WBL) includes a range of activities that extend beyond traditional cooperative education, such as job shadowing, service learning, internships, and apprenticeships--all of which provide career and technical education (CTE) students with valuable experience in the world of work. Several issues are involved in developing meaningful worksite learning experiences. Employer recruitment and commitment are crucial. High-quality and effective partnerships with employers have the following features: explicit learning outcomes, formal assessment processes, identification of standards, application of appropriate quality assurance and enhancement processes, and recognition through the awarding of credit or certification. Quality of the teaching staff is another issue.  CTE teachers should be prepared to facilitate learning and be effective coaches and mentors by engaging in their own work-based experiences. WBL has been shown to facilitate workplace preparation; however, outcomes related to academic achievement are less clear. Questions used to encourage reflection in collaborative learning programs may help educators find ways to document student learning, not just outcomes related to retention, completion, and placement. Work-based learning helps students to integrate knowledge and experience and gain a broad perspective of the learning and skill development that is required to make successful transitions from school to the workplace or further education.

This is followed by a critique of Knowles's assumptions of andragogy through the eyes of foreign-born adult learners that examines the historic, political, and sociocultural contexts that influenced Knowles. The paper then presents several perspectives on transformative learning theory, describing theoretical approaches and criticisms of the theory. The next chapter discusses definitions, history, philosophical underpinnings, models, and criticisms of  self-directed learning. A chapter on critical and postmodern theory explains their historical development, underlying philosophical tenets, and the differences between them. The next chapter examines race and its intersection with class and gender as it applies to learning theory and African Americans' learning processes; it discusses the tenets of Afrocentricity and its role in adult education.

Educators are urged to provide a positive and supportive environment, components of which include satisfaction of basic needs, caring relationships with adults, and physical and psychological security. It stresses that any inclusion in a student's program that serves to enhance feelings of self-worth, self-control, and optimism has  the potential for ameliorating feelings of depression. Educators are also urged to use instructional strategies that are both positive and effective, so that the student will achieve success and enjoy the learning process.

It identifies three subtypes of ADHD, noting both criteria for diagnosis and the subjective determination of what constitutes significant impairment. Discussion of differences in gifted and non-gifted children with ADHD reports findings that identified, gifted ADHD children are more impaired than other ADHD children and that high ability can mask ADHD, while ADHD can depress test scores and academic performance used to identify giftedness. Other findings indicate the social and emotional immaturity of children with ADHD may hamper their adjustment in gifted programs. The paper recommends multidisciplinary team diagnosis of ADHD. It finds agreement that intervention  should focus on developing talent while attending to the disability. However, it also suggests that there is evidence that some commonly recommended interventions for ADHD children (such as decreasing stimulation) may make problems worse for those who are gifted. The digest concludes that finding a good fit that provides both intellectual challenge and needed support and interventions for these students is challenging. (Contains 19 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"The research methodology of this study included both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Samples consisted of school counselors from 66 Victorian, 33 ACT, and 71 NSW schools in Australia. Findings show that building genuine partnerships between school and external communities requires lots of effort, commitment, and time. Effectiveness of a partnership depends on building mutual understanding, trust, and confidence between the parties. It takes time, due to suspicion and feelings of insecurity, but the experience gained enables them to build genuine partnerships to do their best for the children. Schools being people-oriented social organizations, a high level of commitment and dedication of those involved could lead to significant differences in performance. In achieving  the cultural change, the administrators have to work hard in developing the trust and confidence among different categories of stakeholders leading to empowerment toward the realization of the set goals. Findings from both the quantitative and qualitative methodologies suggest that when compared with what they experienced under centralized bureaucratic models, school-based management has created more autonomous, flexible, better quality, effective schools accountable not only to the system managers, but also to school communities.

School improvement is often tied to principal performance, yet the practice of evaluating principal performance leaves a lot to be desired, according to some educators. This ERIC Digest reviews current principal evaluation practices and describes some emerging issues and alternatives. It begins with a discussion of how principals are typically evaluated, noting that while there is little evidence that principals or their districts see evaluation as a major problem, neither is there any indication that evaluation plays a significant role in school improvement. The Digest next discusses the shortcomings of current practices, stressing that because of the complex nature of the job,  principal evaluation is difficult. The Digest then discusses the key elements of effective evaluation, what standards should be used, and what assessment instruments are available. It states that productive evaluation processes are anchored in explicit standards that make expectations clear. Increasingly, policymakers are turning to comprehensive national standards, such as those devised by the Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium. Checklists seem to be the most commonly used assessment instrument. Portfolios are also being used to complement checklists. (WFA)",

The study was a mixed-methods policy analysis that used multiple linear regression, cluster analysis, and interpretative interviews to examine how 24 local school districts in a major metropolitan area of a Midwestern state develop and implement teacher-compensation policies. A significant relationship was found between the percentage of district revenue received from the state and the ratio of actual classroom teachers to students and the districts beginning teacher salary and maximum teacher salary. Interview data examined the role of the local  human-resource officer in implementing policy and developing strategic practices. Local policy and practice, as shown through the human-resource officer, illustrates regional similarity and significant local variation as the districts seek to recruit, reward, and retain highly qualified teachers in an atmosphere of increasing accountability and decreasing revenue.

The main purpose of this study was to ascertain administrators' views of their schools' climate. The second purpose was to examine imperative skills for success as administrators create positive school environments. Forty-one administrators from a school cooperation in a city in Indiana participated in the study. Data were collected before those administrators participated in two 3-hour workshops on the topic of diversity in fall 2001 and spring 2002. The study found that administrators perceived their support for teachers was high, but teacher absenteeism in their respective schools  was a problem. Administrators ranked \"developing positive relationships with staff and school personnel\" as the most important skill. Suggestions generated from participating administrators provide information for other administrators as they strive to cultivate positive school cultures.

The inability to resolve past injustices against American Indians may continue to have health consequences as long as this history continues to repeat itself. Schools can play a role in healing American Indian communities. A focus on traditional Native dispositions of respect, upholding promises, kindness, peacefulness, courage, and moderation will help Native communities regain their traditional role as protectors of the Earth. Work skills are also important, but they should be taught in concert with cultural values and in terms of sustainable economic goals for the community. Schools need to treat children as respected, sacred  beings, a traditional imperative in Native cultures. Children then will feel significant. Schools can become venues for community adults to teach traditional knowledge, thus ending alienation caused by eurocentric curricula. The sharing of Native perspectives and observation skills in school can validate Native wisdom so that Native communities become more confident in following traditional paths toward wellness. (TD)",

The study is unique in two ways.

Referred to as &quot;hard-to-staff&quot; schools, they are often characterized by high-poverty students, low test scores, high staff turnover, and under qualified teachers. This ERIC Digest reviews the available evidence of a leadership shortage for troubled schools and discusses likely ways that districts can improve the supply of qualified principal candidates. The Digest begins with a discussion of the problem of troubled schools finding qualified administrators. It continues with a discussion of recruiting strategies, including the possibility of financial incentives. One effective strategy is to identify, recruit, and train  prospective principals from within the district's teacher corps. Financial incentives as a recruitment strategy may be only a part of the solution. The Digest next discusses how the principalship can be made more satisfying. Noting the inherent stresses in the principalship, some researchers suggest that the burden could be lessened by modifying the position through some sort of distributed leadership. The Digest concludes by discussing candidate qualifications, noting that leadership experience is often considered to be more important than teaching experience. (WFA)",

        "description":"Reauthorization of welfare reform legislation has focused attention on the effectiveness of short-term training as a means for welfare recipients to attain self-sufficiency. Its effects on employment and earnings have been one focus of recent evaluations of federal programs. Although some Job Opportunities and Basic Skills programs produced moderate employment and earnings gains for the most disadvantaged sample members, overall, few programs produced large effects. Job Corps participants enjoyed positive employment and earnings benefits that were relatively even across genders and high- and low-risk groups. Similar effects have been found in studies of state and local programs involving short-term training promoting self-sufficiency, among other services: (1) Connecticut's Jobs  First evaluation; (2) Job Search Assistance Demonstration of unemployment insurance claimants in the District of Columbia and Florida; (3) the Los Angeles Jobs-First GAIN evaluation; and (4) Parents' Fair Share. Other research has identified characteristics of effective programs, including being targeted to the local labor market and to jobs with relatively high earnings, employment growth, and opportunities for advancement, a mix of academic education, occupational skills training, and work-based learning, and other supportive services. Short-term training programs can increase welfare recipients' employment and earnings, but increases are usually small. (Contains 21 references.) (SK)",

The compilation intended to give an overview of selected aspects of the topic and provide information about other resources. In the first section, four trends--globalization, technology, flexible employment practices, and demographics--that will affect the future of work are examined. The second section reviews current arguments related to the high-skills/low-wage debate and poses some possible scenarios for the future. The third section reviews current trends in workplace learning, including social capital, informal learning, electronic learning, and workplace learning, to make  projections about learning in the workplace of the future. The importance of learning as a social process is a common theme in the trends considered. An annotated list provides 13 print resources and 5 websites on the future of work. Contains 105 references.

This compilation looks at the various literacies as the application of critical abilities to several domains of importance to adult life in the 21st century. It begins with an examination of critical literacy for &quot;challenging times,&quot; making the case for its potential to move adult literacy education beyond &quot;neutral and neutralizing notions&quot; of technical skill. In the next chapter, how people acquire digital/electronic literacy and how adult educators can support this effort are examined. Environmental literacy is used as an example of education for effective critique  rather than instrumental purposes in the third chapter. The fourth chapter takes a different perspective on health literacy by addressing its importance for all adults, not just those with low levels of basic skills. An annotated resource list provides sources of more information about critical aspects of the following literacy domains: multiple, critical, civic, digital/electronic, environmental, financial, geographic, health, media, and technological/scientific.

Using a variety of analysis tools and a wide array of collected data, the study answered the following research questions: (1) What are the expenditure patterns over time in school districts across varying levels of student performance? (2) How  do improvement districts (districts with consistent increases in student performance over time) allocate their financial and human resources? (3) What allocation practices have improvement districts implemented that they identify as effective? and (4) What barriers and challenges have improvement districts faced in allocation practices? The policy brief includes study results for each state, definitions, recommendations for policymakers, and a short list of resources. (WFA)",

        "description":"This study, conducted through the Postsecondary Quick Information System (PEQIS) of the National Center for Education Statistics, was designed to provide current national estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of remedial courses and enrollments in degree-granting 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions that enrolled freshmen in fall 2000 and to report changes in remediation from fall 1995. Remedial education courses were defined as courses in reading, writing, or mathematics for college-level students lacking the skills to perform work at the level required by the institution. The study examined two issues not covered in the 1995 survey: types of technology used in the delivery of remedial education through distance education courses and the use of computers as a  hands-on instructional tool for on-campus remedial education. Data are presented by institution type. In fall 2000, about three-quarters (76%) of the Title IV degree-granting 2-year and 4-year institutions that enrolled freshmen offered at least one remedial reading, writing, or mathematics course. A higher proportion offered remedial courses in mathematics and writing than in reading. Remedial course offering were generally limited to a small number of courses; the average number of different remedial courses was 2.0 for reading and writing and 2.5 for mathematics. Public 2-year colleges were more likely than other institutions to provide remedial education, and they offered a greater number of remedial courses. In fall 2000, 28% of entering freshmen enrolled in one or more redial  reading, writing, or mathematics courses, with the largest proportion enrolling in remedial mathematics. At that time 13% of the institutions offered remedial courses through distance education, compared with 3% in 1995. Appendixes discuss the methodology and contain standard error tables and the questionnaires for 1995 and 2000. (Contains 11 figures, 12 tables, and 26 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This issue explores how competitive intercollegiate athletics affects both admissions practices and the nature of academic community at private colleges and universities that practice selective admission. It is based on a roundtable that took place in February 2003. It is clear that the athletic profile of such selective campuses is considerably different than the culture of high-stakes, big-media collegiate sports at the large, mainly public, universities. Athletic participation on these selective campuses can be seen as preparation for life rather than preparation for work. As the competition intensifies for admission to these institutions, so too does the contention over how athletic ability should figure in the mix of factors that determine which students gain admission from  a pool of highly capable and promising applicants. At an earlier age, students in high-aspiration communities come to understand the need to excel in a specific area, to develop a talent that distinguishes them in the competition for admission to the most selective institutions. The subject of athletics has become a focal point for a deeper set of uncertainties within the academy, including the question of what values these institutions seek to foster in their students and learning communities. In all of higher education, there is an uneasy disparity between the drive to academic distinction and athletic prowess. What seems to be missing if not the discussion of athletics per se, but the articulation of the institutional and educational values to provide a context for considering the role  that athletics should play and the resources it should command. The college president has the central leadership role in the explorations of these values and the place of college athletics. (SLD)",

This paper discusses the responses of college disability support services. Many factor complicate the delivery of services for students with psychiatric disabilities, and the nature of such disabilities makes them challenging to accommodate. Students with current documentation of a psychiatric impairment who request services are entitled to accommodations that specifically and appropriately address their needs, such as permission to use peer note takers or extended time to complete examinations. In addition to the challenges posed by the disabilities themselves, students may encounter prejudice and  ignorance. In the end, the academic and personal successes are well worth the efforts of the student, faculty, and staff. (SLD)",

The expert panel broadened the scope of their discussion beyond bioterrorism to include other potential weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Their deliberations identified medical student competencies that should prepare students to identify and response specifically to WMD incidents. The panel agreed that an integral component of the curriculum should focus on physicians' interactions with the public health system to help facilitate effective and coordinated medical and public health response to WMD and to more common  threats to health. Panelists acknowledged that better coordination between medicine and public health would improve the management of public health challenges ranging from food-borne illnesses to natural disasters to infectious diseases. They recognized that in the absence of WMD incidents, conventional public health threats help \"drill\" the coordinated health systems that are central to an effective medical and public health response in the event of a WMD incident. Panelists also concluded that medical students should be taught to adopt a life-long learning perspective with regard to this subject. (SLD)",

This first report focuses on the statewide and &quot;common&quot; institutional indicators for which data are currently available. Data about these indicators indicate that Illinois colleges and universities are facing a growing and more diverse student population. Increasing enrollments and changing demographics will challenge higher education institutions in coming years. Higher levels of education are required in the &quot;knowledge economy,&quot; and the demand will place pressures on the higher education system  to respond. The educational capacity of Illinois exceeds that of the national average on many measures, but more effort is needed to further enhance educational participation and attainment levels. Funding constraints of recent years have contributed to tuition increases that fuel both affordability and fiscal accountability concerns. Greater reliance on student loans and a widening of the affordability gap for low-income students may hinder a student's access to, and choice among, higher education opportunities. Policy implications are discussed for each of the goals of the Illinois Commitment: (1) economic growth; (2) partnerships with P-12 education; (3) affordability; (4) access and diversity; (5) quality; and (6) productivity and accountability.

        "description":"As the academic library plays the roles of intermediary and adjudicator of collection purchases and cancellations, faculty involvement in library resource decisions is not only commonplace, but essential to making such decisions. Faculty involvement in cancellation projects is often enhanced by a thorough explanation of the depth of financial problems facing libraries. This study used both faculty and librarian lenses to examine how members of higher education tend to view journal cancellation factors, both from the vantage point of library users (faculty) and collectors of information (librarians). Responses to questionnaires were received from 18 faculty members (13%) and 20 librarians (87%). The study finds that faculty and librarians indicate highly similar preferences for  factors to use when canceling journals. Two of 10 suggested factors, in-library usage and authority, were named important considerations by both groups. The study highlights the perceived constraints preventing faculty participation in journal cancellation decisions. Librarians named time (42%) and information (36%) at the two main reasons that faculty would have nonparticipation or low participation with librarians on journal cancellation decisions. Five appendixes contain the cover letters and surveys used in the study. (Contains 22 tables and 137 references.) (SLD)",

This paper models the decision to enroll and re-enroll in college, which yields a bivariate probit model that is estimated using detailed individual data from a large public university. The analysis uses the unique detail of institution-specific data to examine the effect of financial aid on the re-enrollment decision, and exploits the sequential college completion process to condition the re-enrollment probabilities for college selection such that the implications are broader than is typical of a single-institution study. Overall, the results indicate that some types of need-based aid improve retention but that merit-based aid has the largest retention effects, particularly for well-to-do enrollees.  (Author/SM)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes how the composition of an institution's student body affects performance of that institution's students, examining how average student quality and dispersion in student quality within the student body affects individual students' future earnings. The first section examines two reasons why one's peers would affect future labor market success: peer effects and employer screening. Peers can augment or detract from human capital accumulation through numerous types of interactions. Employer screening captures the role of one's fellow students in shaping the beliefs of employers about the quality of students at the institution. These may affect employers' actions in two ways (the level of student quality may affect the intensity by which employers recruit, and the  dispersion in student quality may affect the degree to which employers screen by ability when interviewing students). The paper reviews relevant research, then uses 1982 High School and Beyond Survey data to provide additional evidence. Findings are consistent with previous research. Overall, level of student quality at an institution is an important determinant of earnings. A 100-point increase in the median SAT relates to a 3-percent increase in student annual earnings. Students with lower SAT scores appear to receive the highest premium from attending an institution with a high median SAT. (Contains 21 references.) (SM)",

After outlining probable determinants (e.g., enrollment supply and demand and financial considerations), data from a national sample of institutions from 1984-1997 are used to examine whether these factors explain the composition of a school's enrollment. Next, the paper examines variation in enrollments across institutional types and finds three main differences: (1) the transfer enrollment rate, the percentage of an institution's incoming students who are transfers, is larger at public than private institutions; (2) the transfer enrollment rate falls for private institutions as they become more selective, but the relationship between selectivity and transfer enrollment share is more  complex for public institutions; and (3) private liberal arts I colleges have lower transfer enrollment rates than other schools. Finally the paper investigates factors besides institutional type that determine the composition of a school's new student enrollment. For both public and private institutions, transfer enrollment rates are higher at institutions with more student attrition, less financial resources, less freshmen in campus housing, lower tuition and fees, and more students attending two-year institutions in the school's state.

This paper surveys the various strands of the literature on the econometrics of higher education that have developed during the last 40 years and indicates how a collection of papers fits into this literature. It also discusses: the estimation of rates of return to higher education; determinants of college enrollment, college graduation, and choice of major; studies of the academic labor market; studies relating to models of university behavior; and studies relating to higher education as an industry and higher education governance. The paper stresses that the central econometric problem faced by higher education  researchers who employ individual-level data is that of selection. Similarly, the central econometric problem faced by researchers who use market-level data is the difficulty of disentangling demand and supply shocks. Much of the challenge that empirical higher education researchers face is attempting to satisfactorily resolve these problems. (Contains 174 references.) (SM)",

They then use the QAR strategy to determine the mathematical and cognitive actions required to answer the word problem. This activity is particularly appropriate for fourth- and fifth-grade students. During two 40-minute sessions, students will: preview tables to stimulate prior knowledge, make predictions, interact with print, and generate questions and answers about the content; understand that the format of a table supports comprehension of the relationship between data and the self-monitoring of responses to questions; practice analyzing word problems using the QAR strategy to predict a computation strategy and determine a response; understand that the  type of question may indicate the need for different cognitive and mathematical actions; apply think-aloud strategies in small groups to aid in metacognition and to verbalize their thinking process; and discuss the material with peers, monitor and correct their own work, encourage and support one another, and reinforce social skills in collaborative learning groups. The instructional plan, lists of resources, student assessment/reflection activities, and a list of National Council of Teachers of English/International Reading Association (NCTE/IRA) Standards addressed in the lesson are included.

Data came from annual reports from 30 charter schools statewide, the American Federation of Teachers, the Charter Schools Institute at the State University of New York, the New York State Board of Regents, Edison Schools, and the U.S. General Accounting Office. Results indicate that demand for charter schools in New York State is waning; charter schools are not making the grade academically; special education students are underrepresented in New York's charter  schools and in their annual reports; and charter schools have wreaked tremendous fiscal havoc on New York's public school districts. The report concludes that at a time when traditional public schools, which educate the majority of children in New York, are struggling to cope with a fiscal crisis that threatens to derail their success, the investment in charter schools is not justified. Recommendations to the state legislature include: provide transitional funding via the charter school stimulus fund to local districts to help them better plan and absorb the impact of a charter school established in or near the district and limit the authorization of charters to low-performing districts.

It demonstrates that there are three management tasks: building support and legitimacy within the authorizing environment; mobilizing effective operational capacity to deliver services; and defining a proposition or mission to guide the school. The report focuses on: the elements of strategy; strategy and stages of school development; the three elements of charter school management; and performance measurement. It concludes that charter school leaders cannot focus on educational matters alone, but instead must have an understanding of how to manage and position an organization, usually a nonprofit organization, in a changing  environment in which they are responsible for the stewardship of resources and the mobilization of support. The report also asserts that charter school management is difficult because it requires both the political skills of traditional public school principals and the operational eye for detail of successful private school headmasters. Finally, it notes that as the charter school movement continues to grow, the need for leaders with strong management skills will become more pressing. (SM)",

        "description":"This report discusses findings from 2003 surveys conducted by Advocates for Children of New York (AFC), which assessed the implementation and effectiveness of the Supplemental Education Services program (SES) required under the No Child Left Behind Act. SES services, which began in 2002-2003, offered over 240,000 eligible children in schools considered &quot;in need of improvement&quot; the possibility of receiving extra academic services such as tutoring and remediation outside the school day. AFC works with thousands of poor parents, helping them obtain mandated services for their children. During the past school year, parents informed AFC of their difficulties in applying for and receiving SES services. The survey asked SES private providers serving these children about strengths and  barriers in implementing this program. SES services have been portrayed as a panacea for assisting poor students in failing schools succeed, and it was AFC's goal to assess how successful this assistance was to at-risk students. Of the 21 private providers serving NYC students, 16 responded to the survey. Results found major problems with implementation, both with state and city overseers giving information and assistance to private providers and providers being able to reach and serve eligible students. Services to children at especially high risk, those who were English language learners and those who were disabled, were especially problematic. (Contains over 70 endnotes.) (SM)",

Results indicated that the percentage of coresident grandparents varied sharply by race and Hispanic origin. More than half of American Indian and Alaska Native coresident grandparents and black coresident grandparents were responsible for their grandchildren. Younger grandparents were more likely to be responsible for their grandchildren. The west had the highest percentage of coresident grandparents. Counties in the midwest had some of the lowest coresident grandparent percentages. At the state level, Hawaii had the highest percentage of grandparents living with grandchildren, and North Dakota had the  lowest. For many grandparent caregivers, this responsibility was a long-term commitment. San Diego, California, had the lowest percentage of coresident grandparents among the 10 largest cities in the United States. Of the 5.8 million coresident grandparents in 2000, 64 percent were women. Nearly all of grandparent caregivers were either the householder or the spouse of the householder.

The study asked school principals about the characteristics of school policies, school violence prevention programs and practices, violent deaths at school and elsewhere, frequency of crime and violence, disciplinary problems and actions, and other school characteristics associated with school crime. Results indicated that 71 percent of the schools experienced at least one violent incident in 1999-00 (including rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with and without a weapon, threats of physical attack with and without a weapon, and robbery with and without a weapon). Overall, approximately  1,466,000 such incidents were reported. One or more serious violent incidents occurred in 20 percent of all public schools. Secondary schools, city schools, schools with the lowest achievement, and schools where students had a larger number of classroom changes were the most likely to report violent incidents. About 7 percent of public schools accounted for 50 percent of the total violent incidents. Tables of estimates, tables of standard errors, figures, and an appendix (SSOCS Questionnaire) comprise the bulk of the document. (Contains 37 references.) (SM)",

It stems from interviews with public officials, employment service providers, welfare office workers, immigrant and refugee service providers, advocates, and others in Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and New York, New York. It uses case studies conducted for the Urban Institute's Assessing the New Federalism project. It also uses Current Population Survey and 2000 Census data. Despite declining use of welfare nationally, immigrants and limited English speakers still comprise a significant share of people on welfare.  Immigrants compose one-third of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) California's and New York's caseload and one-fifth of Texas'. Many immigrants on welfare have significant barriers to work (lower education levels and less work history than natives). Many job training programs have English language requirements that limit access to immigrants with little English. Proposed TANF reforms increasing the number of required hours of work and limiting the types of activities that count as work will make it harder for immigrants to receive language or vocational training. Combining an emphasis on employment with opportunities for developing skills could be an especially effective model for limited English speakers. (Contains 28 references.) (SM)",

Three-fourths of all U.S. workers with less than a ninth grade education are immigrants. Nearly two-thirds of low-wage immigrant workers do not speak English proficiently, and most of these workers have little formal education. Two of every five low-wage immigrant workers are undocumented. While the low-wage native labor force is mainly female, men dominate the low-wage immigrant labor force. Even though they are less likely to participate in the labor force, female immigrant workers are better educated and more  likely to be in the country legally than male immigrants. Foreign-born women earn substantially lower wages than foreign-born men and native women. Although immigrants dominate a few low-wage occupations, such as farming and private household work, immigrants in these occupations represent a small share of all immigrant workers.

It looks at how admissions officers currently make decisions and trends in admissions decisions between 1979-2000. Reports findings of an Educational Testing Service poll of the American public on admissions questions. These data are applied to the nation's most competitive four-year colleges. Chapter 1, \"Who Attends Selective Universities\", finds that under current affirmative action policies, racial minorities and low-income students are underrepresented. Chapter 2, \"Why It Matters Who Attends Selective Universities\", finds that attending a selective institution provides greater likelihood of  graduating, greater access to graduate schooling, and a wage premium in the labor market. Chapter 3, \"Defining Merit and Fairness in College Admissions\", examines how merit is defined by key audiences, concluding that a dynamic concept of merit is widely accepted as appropriate. Chapter 4, \"Economic Affirmative Action\", concludes that while selective colleges purport to provide preferences to low-income students, they actually do not provide systemic preference. Chapter 5, \"Simulation of Alternative Admission Strategies\", concludes that a system of grades and test scores would significantly reduce racial and ethnic diversity but increase income diversity.

This model emphasizes small class and school size, extended instruction, and strong relationships with family. The six schools included in the study are found in five different urban locations in the United States. In five of the six schools, students showed improvements in standardized test scores in reading and mathematics that exceeded one grade level per year and high grade 6-to-8 persistence rates. Across all schools, student academic performance was found to be related to principals' perceptions of parents' commitment to their children's education, students' social maturity ratings, ratings of students' leadership, and, to a lesser extent,  student academic effort. School data show that student academic performance was related negatively to school size, average class size, and student-teacher ratio and positively to the expenditure for teacher salaries per student. This preliminary research will serve to inform a more extensive investigation of the model to include factors such as the quality of administrative leadership and teaching. (Contains 10 references.)

        "description":"This study assessed how New Jersey's state accountability system encouraged or thwarted charter school success, how effectively performance standards were defined and enacted by authorizing agents, and how individual charter schools were developing accountability processes that made them more or less successful than their charter school counterparts. Between 2001-2002, researchers conducted qualitative research in four New Jersey charter schools, examining the accountability system's monitoring and oversight; warning and probation systems; authorization, renewal, and closure processes; the agency's role in assisting charter schools in trouble; and benchmarks established for judging charter performance. The study also examined charter schools' curriculum and teaching practices and  their academic and non-academic programs. Findings showed that the state authorizer lacks the capacity and authority to develop an effective performance-based accountability system. Results also indicated that New Jersey charter schools were far from free of district or state rules and regulations, and charter law generally reproduced the bureaucracy found in district schools. While charter schools had to comply with all state education laws (except a few facility standards), they were expected to do so with less funding. Because each charter school acted as a self-contained district, administrative burdens of reporting to the state Department of Education combined with the monetary need to apply for federal grants requiring extensive documentation created a perilous strain on charter  school administrators' time, resources, and energy.

        "description":"This study examined whether the Chicago Annenberg Challenge promoted improvement in schools it supported and in student achievement and other outcomes; factors that might explain improvement or lack thereof among Annenberg schools; and what could be learned from the Challenge's experiences. It highlighted the period between 1996-1997 through 2000-2001. Results suggest that among the schools it supported, the Challenge had little impact on school improvement and student outcomes, with no statistically significant differences between Annenberg and non-Annenberg schools in rates of achievement gain, classroom behavior, student self-efficacy, and social competence. The study also examined trends in school improvement among a small group of &quot;Breakthrough Schools,&quot; which received  special financial and professional support from the Challenge between 1990-2001, a time during which the Challenge began withdrawing funds from the other Annenberg schools. Overall, Breakthrough schools began to develop in ways that distinguished them from other Annenberg schools and sustained or strengthened aspects of teacher professional community, school leadership, and relational trust while other Annenberg schools did not. Factors distinguishing strong and weak schools included cultivation of strong, distributive leadership and use of an array of complementary, reinforcing strategies.

        "description":"Private school regulation is a growing concern among school choice proponents. This paper uses a national survey of private schools to analyze the potential effects of various regulations. More than 1,000 schools answered questions about their willingness to participate in school choice programs if they had to comply with particular regulations. Results revealed that directors of many private schools would rather turn down \"free money\" than compromise the core qualities of their schools. Different kinds of schools often did not agree on what those core qualities were. The paper examines some economic flaws in school choice programs and explains why limiting student eligibility narrows the market and stunts improvement and why school choice policies must be carefully crafted to  consider the dominance and funding structure of Catholic schools. Finally, the paper provides guidelines for school choice policymakers: create broad-based demand; create a wide-open playing field on which schools may differentiate themselves and compete, and eliminate entry barriers to new schools; avoid skewing prices with tuition caps, or non-need-based subsidization; and avoid conflicts of interest between the people paying for education and the parents and children benefiting by creating a system that maximizes direct payment by parents and minimizes coercive wealth transfers through the state.

The report uses school and district level data to examine student demographics, achievement, and engagement at the 11 Pilot Schools that were in operation for over 1 year. Overall, while the Pilot Schools serve a student population generally representative of the Boston Public Schools, their students perform well on all available measures of student engagement and performance and are among the top performing of all Boston Public Schools. This report concludes that with an enrollment roughly mirroring the district's student population, the Pilot Schools have succeeded in creating  communities of learning which meet students academic and emotional needs. These schools have low grade retention and high graduation rates and send significantly more students on to postgraduate education. The Pilot Schools succeed because their status, with autonomy from the district over budget, staffing, scheduling, governance, and curriculum, allows them to create unified learning communities. Their smallness allows staff and students to know each other well, and structures such as smaller learning communities and advisories allow relationships among school community members to build over time.

Information came from the Common Core of Data (CCD) surveys, which provide basic data on public K-12 institutions, students, and staff. A total of 45 states reported dropouts using the CCD definition. The 9th-12th grade dropout rate ranged from 2.2 percent in North Dakota to 10.9 percent in Arizona. Most states had rates from 4.0 to 7.0 percent. Data on high school dropout rates for each of five racial/ethnic groups indicated that the rates were generally lowest for white, non-Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander students and highest for American Indian/Alaska Native; black, non-Hispanic; and Hispanic students. Relatively high dropout rates were  most often observed in reporting school districts serving large or midsize cities and least frequently in rural areas. States' numbers of high school completers varied widely. Most high school completion credentials were in the form of a diploma. Asian/Pacific Islander and White, non-Hispanic students were more likely to have higher completion rates than the other three groups. Large city school districts were more likely than other districts to have a relatively low high school 4-year completion rate of less than 60 percent. (SM)",

The states illustrate the degree of diversity in governance systems and local provider systems and allow for comparative analyses by provider type. The following areas were explored: (1) the number of community colleges providing adult basic education (ABE) services and the number of students they serve; (2) how demographics of ABE learners differ among providers; (3) educational functioning levels of ABE learners at entry; (4) program service patterns of community colleges; (5) how learning gains and persistence rates compare among community colleges and other providers; (6)  labor force status and public assistance status of ABE learners served in community colleges; (7) the staffing patterns of ABE classes in community colleges; and (8) the characteristics of California ABE classes in community colleges. Conclusions reached about community colleges among the states studied are as follows: (1) they are viable providers of adult education and appear to deliver ABE at least as well as other providers; (2) they appear to be serving those populations in need; (3) they use a variety of staffing personnel to deliver ABE, including volunteers; and (4) among follow-up studies needed to further analyze state delivery of ABE are those on whether economies of scale exist, how differences in state funding relate to quality of delivery systems, how state policies differ  on providing ABE programs to welfare recipients, and how staffing patterns differ.

The section on principle two organize your material for presentation in a logical order describes the following three ways to logically organize materials: (1) by content, for ideas which are foundational; (2) by experience, to clearly link materials to the relevant experiences of the audience; and (3) by interest, to keep the audience focused. The section on principle three don't feel that you have to tell them everything suggests telling the audience a bit and then creating ways  to let them tell you what else they need to know. The section on principle four understand what you want the adults to do with the information you are presenting describes the following four levels, each of which builds upon the previous one: know information, understand information, use information, and share information with others. The section on principle five know when to teach and when to learn suggests that teachers and students can learn from one another.

        "author":["Hoagland, Matthew A."],
        "description":"When an adult outside the classroom learns history, it almost always begins with some connection or personal interest. The learning may be haphazard, but it will probably include movies, primary sources, trips to historical sites, and contacts with others with similar interests. The result is an understanding that is actively constructed, not just passively received. Among current approaches to teaching, constructivism most closely resembles the model used by adult learners. Applying constructivist concepts to the teaching of social studies can revolutionize the learning environment, and perhaps recapture the joy of learning that is central to human nature. This paper defines constructivism and explains the theories of the educators who elaborated on it, most importantly Jean  Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. The paper discusses the consequences of adopting constructivism in the classroom. It notes that some history subjects, such as world history, are so vast that they cannot possibly be covered completely. By focusing on relevancy and connections to modern issues, teachers can create criteria for deciding what is worth covering. The paper discusses obstacles and criticisms of constructivism. For example, it might not be a completely accurate theory of how people learn. Constructivism does not fit the current educational environment, with its push for objectivism and standardized tests. The paper includes examples of constructivist-style lessons for high school classrooms. It also describes the capstone project as a year-end activity. Contains a 20-item select  bibliography. (BT)",

Problematic is the ubiquitous usage of the term, as well as the fact that multiculturalism and multicultural education have different meanings and usage in the United States and Europe. In Europe, and in particular southeastern Europe (SEE) multiculturalism rests on varying interpretations and definitions, distinct from those found in the United States. The paper focuses on uncovering how multicultural education might be used as a vehicle for changing attitudes and perceptions held on the part of citizens. It also can be seen as a movement toward educating students in SEE, particularly in the  Balkans, about respecting diversity which appears to be a necessity, as individuals need to acquire the ability to comprehend that differences do not necessarily have to be accompanied by negative characterizations. For the purpose of this paper, multiculturalism is understood as the realization and awareness that people are living in a multicultural, interdependent, global world that necessitates that individuals understand and comprehend peoples of other cultures, religions, and political systems so that they can be effective members of their own society. The paper discusses what multicultural education means in practice, multicultural societies in SEE and multicultural education, multicultural education and democracy where they intersect, and how educators know when they are achieving  their goals.

The young women are less likely to exhibit behaviors  high in verbal and nonverbal dominance, but those who engage in aggressive verbal behavior rebutting and referencing others are more likely to be successful.

It utilizes data from the student information systems of Broome Community College, New York; Cayuga Community College, New York; the State University of New York central database; and the NSC database. Data analysis indicates that using the NSC data more than doubled the number of community college transfer students who could be tracked. By using these data, researchers were able to show that current research has underestimated the transfer rate by as much as 25 percent. Results also find that: community college students are probably less likely to cross state borders  when they transfer than are students at four-year colleges; transfer rates to private and out-of-state colleges are more likely when those colleges are close to home; transfer rates from community college transfer programs are significantly higher than transfer rates from non-transfer programs; more students transfer without the associate degree than with the degree, although a greater percentage of graduates transfer than non-graduates; and the location of transfer can be affected by local economic conditions.

It illustrates implications of some of these changes for patterns of faculty compensation and faculty turnover observed across academic institutions. The paper looks at the growing importance of scientific research to universities and the growing costs that universities are incurring for this research, noting that the enormous costs of scientific research are increasingly being borne by the institutions themselves, and institutions need to understand who actually bears the burden of these costs. The paper suggests that although institutions are increasingly  hoping to generate revenue to support their research through the commercialization of faculty members' research findings, very few institutions are generating substantial funding from commercialization activities. It concludes with speculations about the directions in which the U.S. higher education system will evolve over the next few decades and discusses potentially major financial issues facing academic institutions in the future.

It presents evidence, based on a survey of department chairs, deans, and vice presidents for research at over 200 public and private universities on the magnitude of start-up packages received by researchers in science and engineering disciplines. It then uses panel data for 21 years and over 200 universities to estimate the impact of growing internal expenditures on research on student/faculty ratios, the substitution of lecturers for tenure track faculty, on average faculty salaries and on tuition levels at public and private universities.  Among the most important findings is that universities whose research expenditures per faculty member out of internal funds has been growing the most rapidly in absolute terms, &quot;ceteris paribus,&quot; have the greatest increase in student/faculty ratios. So while undergraduate students may benefit from being in close proximity to great researchers, they also bear part of the costs in the form of larger class sizes and fewer full-time faculty members.

The study focused on how faculty members' productivity in the supervision of PhD students varied over their life cycles. Data analysis indicated that PhD supervisory responsibilities were unequally distributed both across broad fields and within each broad field category at the university and that substantial fractions of tenured and tenure track faculty failed to chair or serve as a minor member of any PhD  committee during the 7-year period. Across faculty members in a given field, productivity in supervising PhD students varied systematically with several measures that reflected on the research productivity of the faculty members. On average, more productive researchers supervised the research of more PhD students. The number of PhD students a faculty member supervised varied systematically over the faculty member's life cycle at Cornell, with productivity first increasing and then decreasing with years at Cornell.

The study uses information on the set of colleges that students applied to as a way to account for selection in college attendance patterns. Analysis of data from two longitudinal data sets of students who attended college in the 1970s (including information on students' location during high school, colleges they applied to and attended, and state of residence 10-15 years after college) indicates that there is a modest link between attending college in a state and working in the state. The magnitude of the effect raises doubts that location-choice considerations  alone can justify merit scholarship programs. The translation of additional students to additional college educated workers in a state is much less than one-for-one because the labor market acts to re-sort students across states after college. Thus, the mobility of college graduates across states limits the effectiveness of merit scholarship program. (Contains 24 references.) (SM)",

It summarizes the levels of continuation rates, by institutional category and public/private form of control during the period, and it uses AAUP institutional level data and data from other sources to estimate continuation rate equations. A key concern of the paper is the level of average faculty compensation at an institution and its effect on professorial turnover. Data analysis indicates that associate professor continuation rates are positively associated with the average level of compensation that associate professors  receive. Holding other factors constant, including the public/private control of an institution, unionization of faculty, and highest degree that the institution grants, a $10,000 increase in associate professor compensation is related to a 0.5-0.8 percentage point increase in its associate professor continuation rate and thus an equivalent decline in its associate professor turnover rate.

It presents background data on how the ratios of full-time lecturers to full-time professorial faculty and of part-time faculty to full-time faculty changed at SUNY from 1985-2001. It offers a conceptual framework illustrating why an institution's usage of part-time and non-tenure track faculty members should depend upon both the revenue per student received by the institution and the relative costs to the institution of the different types of faculty. Finally, it estimates the  roles that average salaries of both types of faculty members and revenues received by institutions play in explaining the observed changes in faculty composition. Results suggest that growing use of full-time, non-tenure track faculty is at least partially due to resource constraints faced by institutions increasing costs of professorial faculty relative to lecturers. Lack of data on the salaries of part-time faculty members in the SUNY System prevented similar analyses for their increased usage. (Contains 11 references.) (SM)",

The study was the first to decompose faculty earnings inequality into the proportion of the earnings inequality that is attributable to differences in earnings across institutions and the proportion of earnings inequality that is attributable to differences within institutions. It attempted to identify sources of the growing earnings inequality within institutions. Data analysis indicated that overall earnings inequality among college and university faculty increased from the late 1980s to late 1990s. This increase was the product of both increases in  between-institutions earnings inequality, as well as to increases in within-institution earnings inequality, even conditional upon rank, tenure status, experience, seniority, gender race, citizenship, and field of specialization. Overall, the dispersion of earnings among observationally equivalent faculty has increased. (Contains 14 references.) (SM)",

Temperament classifications were guardian, artisan, idealist, and rational, and were determined through the Keirsey Temperament Sorter II. Preferred learning style categories were active/reflective, sensory/intuitive, visual/verbal, and sequential/global, based on Felder  and Solomons Index of Learning Styles. Satisfaction was measured on a 16-item satisfaction scale developed by the researcher. Forward selection logistic regression analysis of the data revealed that the level of experience with using the World Wide Web and gender were significant predictors of student satisfaction when all other variables were controlled. Students who described themselves as being at ease with using the Web were more likely than less experienced users to be satisfied with the digital learning environment. Females were more likely to be satisfied with digital learning than were males. Considered important from the research findings is the absence of predictors of satisfaction, with the view that students considering enrolling in courses that incorporate digital learning,  but who may be reluctant to register because of perceived mismatches between personal traits and the digital environment should be reassured that the environment is not restrictive in terms of temperament, preferred learning styles, age, grade point average, university classification, major, or previous digital learning experience.

The design of the study was a single-sample pretest-posttest with no control group since the students were taught by the same instructor. The instruction was the Statistics Attitude Survey (D. Roberts and E. Bilderback, 1980). Findings indicate differences in the distributions of ranks between pretest and posttest results. Most of these differences occurred as increases in the rankings  marked at each end of the scales. That is, after the course, students felt more strongly that they agreed or disagreed with statements about some aspects of statistics. For example, students agreed more strongly that statistics would be useful to test the superiority of one method over another and that statistics provide a useful way to improve the quality of professional performance. They disagreed more strongly that one should be good at mathematics before attempting statistics and that statistics is too theoretical to be much use to the average professional. Comments from the open-ended evaluation forms may help explain survey results. Findings suggest that offering the course using computers may help improve students attitudes about certain aspects of statistics. The course syllabus  is attached.

The qualitative study analyzed interview data gathered in 6 face-to-face interviews with 16 African American males over a 3-month period in the 2002-2003 academic year. All students were regular education students between 8 and 13 years old. The interviews focused on home and school experiences and how these two environments affected their academic success. Findings reveal that academic assistance and parental involvement were primary factors supporting and promoting their academic success. In addition, classroom distractions, study habits, problems at school, and school safety concerns were inhibitors of their  academic success. Among students who did not perform well academically, early literacy activities had not been a substantial part of their preschool experiences. Recommendations growing from the study included a similar study with African American males from different parts of the United States and a replication with African American girls to compare their responses to see if they have the same viewpoints related to academic success and failure.

The position subsequently was converted to a tenure track position. The author discusses the demands and rewards of her nontraditional education and eventual career path. She also outlines  some of the differences in teaching at secondary and tertiary levels. (SLD)",

It illustrates how statistical language and research terminology can be simplified in reports. The paper also demonstrates how quantitative reports could be restructured to make them more reader friendly without sacrificing any important statistical information. It is suggested that by restructuring these reports, practitioners and stakeholders would be in a much better position to read quantitative research articles, the findings of which could be used to improve the quality of education. Not only would the divide between researchers and practitioners be reduced, educational research studies would have a larger impact on schools. (Contains 3 tables and 22  references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The last 100 years have witnessed a fervent debate in the United States about quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. Unfortunately, this has led to a great divide between quantitative and qualitative researchers, who often view themselves in competition with each other. Clearly, this polarization has promoted purists, i.e., researchers who restrict themselves exclusively to either quantitative or qualitative research methods. Mono-method research is the biggest threat to the advancement of the social sciences. As long as researchers stay polarized in research they cannot expect stakeholders who rely on their research findings to take their work seriously. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the debate between quantitative and qualitative is divisive, and thus  counterproductive for advancing the social and behavioral science field. This paper advocates that all graduate students learn to use and appreciate both quantitative and qualitative research. In so doing, students will develop into what is termed pragmatic researchers.

        "description":"The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) program was implemented in a partnership between the University of Tennessee (UT) and two rural East Tennessee school systems. The study addressed the residual impact of UT GEAR UP on middle school teachers and schools that were left behind as the cohort progressed to project high schools. The study also examined the extent to which GEAR UP project elements were sustained approximately 1 year later. The UT GEAR UP project provided interventions to only one cohort of students, the class of 2006. Services began in 2000-2001, and, although they continue at the high school level, they have been completed for the middle school level. The study used data collected as part of the annual reporting requirements  and findings of the projects external evaluator. In addition, teacher participants for the study of sustainability were the 50 teachers in the 14 middle schools that participated in the project years and administrators at those schools. Findings show that 1 year after the project terminated, teachers and administrators continued to hold favorable attitudes about the activities and interventions. There was some evidence of residual impacts of the program, but few project interventions were actually sustained at a meaningful level a year later. Lack of resources, lack of time, and lack of overall project leadership and staff were reported as barriers to sustaining GEAR UP initiatives. From the perspective of sustainability, these schools need immediate support. It appears unlikely that the  project can be sustained at the high school level after the graduation of the project cohort. There is, however, some evidence that GEAR UP project efforts are consistent with recognized dimensions of meaningful school change. (Contains 37 references.) (SLD)",

Both repeated measures analysis of variance and latent curve analysis (LCA) were used to predict the academic success of kindergarten and first grade children. Results show that both income level and parent education level had statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) effects on reading, mathematics, and general knowledge item response theory (IRT) scale  scores, while family structure had a much weaker effect (nonsignificant) on reading, mathematics, and general knowledge IRT scale scores. Further, the means of Head Start children from families at or above the poverty level were consistently higher than those of children from families below the poverty level. The study compared LCA model fit statistics for the models tested. The growth model used for reading appears to provide the best-fit statistics. The growth model for knowledge provides the second best-fit statistics. The growth model for mathematics fit well overall, although the fit statistics are not as ideal as the reading and knowledge growth models. More studies need to be done in that area. (Author/SLD)",

Middle Start was coordinated by the Michigan Middle Start Partnership, and alliance that provided technical assistance, professional development, networking, policy development, research, and other services. Middle Start seeks to build academically excellent developmentally responsive, and socially equitable learning environments for middle graders by developing small learning communities, varied and rigorous instruction, meaningful family and community involvement, and schoolwide reflection and assessment. The principal of Lake Middle School and the Technical Assistant (TA)  assigned by the partnership shared the vision that Lake would be a full-service school, and over the 4 years of the collaboration, Lake made several improvements, including small learning communities, expanded special education inclusion, innovative instructional strategies, better programs for family involvement and health and counseling, and improved preparation for high school and beyond. Data for this qualitative study were collected from spring 2000 to spring 2001. Findings show that students at Lake found their classes engaging and the school climate safe and supportive. They also improved their performance on standardized tests. In the future, the school will attempt to extend its improvement efforts through deepening professional development in instructional strategies for staff  and fostering meaningful opportunities for family and community involvement in the school.

Kellogg Middle Start Initiative is a comprehensive educational reform effort to foster school improvement efforts and build public support for middle-grades reform in Michigan. Begun in 1993-1994, Middle State has to date involved more than 220 schools, including those that have received grants for comprehensive school improvement (CSI) and focused grants to improve reading and mathematics. The Academy for Educational Development has been conducting the documentation and cluster evaluation of the Middle Start Initiative since its beginning in spring 1994. This study examined the progress of 12 schools receiving CSI grants as part of their involvement in Middle Start. The case studies were designed to capture the pathways adopted by the schools over time to evolve into  middle-grades schools that promoted academic achievement, healthy development, and social equity. The study included interviews with CSI principals, interviews with CSI teacher teams, classroom observations in CSI schools, review of annual reports of CSI schools and technical assistance partners, site observations, documentation of network meetings, and data from evaluation forms at networking conferences. Findings show that schools obtained the best student outcomes when they developed an integrated focus on varied aspects of middle-school reform. Technical assistance partners played key roles in guiding the integration of time, expertise, and partnerships. Six schools led in the comprehensive and integrated nature of their reforms. Four schools demonstrated moderate progress for  students, and two schools struggled to meet their Middle Start goals and showed lower levels of outcomes for students. (SLD)",

It discusses the rankings categories (academic reputation, student selectivity, faculty resources, graduation and retention rate, alumni giving, financial resources, and graduation rate performance), and it notes how the rankings methodology allows colleges and universities to take actions to manipulate their rankings and the effects that such actions have on higher education. The paper questions why colleges and universities continue to participate in the rankings if they are flawed, discussing some of the major problems with the rankings. The paper  concludes that the problem with &quot;USNWR&quot; rankings is not its presentation of information on individual data elements but rather its effort to aggregate these elements into a single index, noting that if it stopped doing this, many of the objections that people have about the ratings would stop. Finally, the paper offers thoughts about how the &quot;USNWR&quot; could alter its rating formula in ways that would be more socially desirable. (Contains 20 references.) (SM)",

Potential engineering majors were somewhat better prepared in mathematics and science than in the past. Gender representation remained relatively unchanged, with females comprising only 18-20 percent of all potential engineering majors. The percentage of potential engineering majors among various minority groups improved over the 12 years, although this improvement was largely due to decreases in the numbers of Caucasians planning to major in engineering.

The program's initial topic, \"The Global Growth of Private Higher Education,\" concentrates on identifying the scope, contours, and patterns of rapid expansion. A crucial goal is bolstering and revising the three general categories of private higher education growth and functioning developed in the literature so far: (1) cultural distinctions; (2) academic or socioeconomic advantage; and (3)  demand-absorption. A recent development that merits particular attention is the surge in for-profit activity. Once it builds its knowledge base, PROPHE will turn increasingly to matters of policy.

        "description":"South Africa's private higher education system is an illustration of the worldwide surge in commercial private higher education. Important features in the South African case epitomize worldwide growth or show it in stark form. At the core of the starkness is the for-profit nature of South African private higher education. For-profit logic plays out in nearly all matters key to the country's private higher education, including missions, actors' roles within and beyond the higher education institutions, ties to the job market, and relationships with public entities. In contrast, private higher education outside South Africa is usually nonprofit; more aptly states, however, it is nonprofit in name and legal status but often for-profit in much form and behavior. For its profits and  practicality thrust, South Africa presents an intriguing case through which to explore the nature of the world's expanding commercial private higher education. Tendencies in South Africa lead to or support significant hypotheses about this form of education, particularly in its for-profit manifestation. In turn, such hypotheses, along with data on other countries (especially the United States) help guide empirical exploration of the South African case. (Contains 53 endnotes.) (Author/SLD)",

The United States Constitution guarantees certain inalienable rights and protections. However, a person only needs to read &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center (New York) and the Pentagon (Washington, D.C.), the subsequent passage of the USA Patriot Act, and the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to realize that discussing the current U.S. wars in the classroom can be impact a professor's career. If the professor is untenured or not on tenure track, student evaluations can influence an instructor's reappointment. Yet, those who teach international relations/studies courses cannot shy away from discussing controversial current  events that are part of the curriculum. This paper offers an approach that allows a professor to employ both pedagogical and andragogical techniques to ease the difficulties of discussing current U.S. wars in the classroom. It notes that the basic difference between pedagogy and andragogy is one of treating learners as passive and dependent individuals or as relatively autonomous and self-directed individuals.

        "description":"This report describes a program to improve student achievement through the use of music strategies. The targeted population was fifth-grade students in a small Iowa community. The absence of music integration into the social studies area was observed through data that displayed the lack of motivation and in-depth learning by the students. Analysis of probable cause data revealed evidence of shallow learning and an inability to see relationships between the two disciplines. The time factor in planning interdisciplinary studies discouraged implementing a plan. A review of solution strategies suggested by knowledgeable others, combined with analysis of the problem setting resulted in selection of three major categories of intervention: (1) accommodate with various learning styles;  (2) implement cross-curricular thematic instruction; and (3) use aesthetic education. Students experienced music that encouraged them to become more aware of characteristics of the historical period they studied. The aesthetics of music helped to make history more personal and real than merely reading the chapter in the social studies text. Post-intervention data indicated an increase in student motivation, increase in understanding relationships between the two disciplines, and increase in in-depth learning. Student reactions, test results, and the teacher comments regarding the project indicated that it was a positive experience. If the project were to be repeated with another group of students, more student-driven research and less teacher-directed teaching would be planned. (Contains  2 tables and 35 references.)

        "description":"Handheld computers have gone beyond the world of business and are now finding their way into the hands of social studies teachers and students. This paper discusses how social studies teachers can use handheld computers to aid anytime/ anywhere course management. The integration of handheld technology into the classroom provides social studies teachers an opportunity to promote student-centered learning. Integration strategies that promote technology integration and student-centered learning are described. Ideas range from the use of handhelds as creative and reflective writing journals to the use of handhelds as databases that store data to promote analysis. The range of software promoting the integration of handhelds into the K-12 setting expands daily. (Contains 11  references.) (Author/BT)",

        "description":"An increasing number of U.S. high school graduates enter college while still in the process of learning English. Referred to as generation 1.5 students because they share characteristics of both first- and second-generation immigrants, they do not fit into any of the traditional categories of nonnative English speakers enrolled in college writing courses, nor have they been the focus of much research on students learning to write in English as a second language. Familiar with U.S. culture and schooling, generation 1.5 students have different learning needs from other English language learners, such as immigrants with limited English proficiency and international students who travel to the United States for the express purpose of earning an American college degree. This digest  discusses some of the special needs of generation 1.5 students in the area of writing instruction and explores issues faced by English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) and college writing programs in providing these students with appropriate writing instruction at the college level.

        "description":"Students of foreign language are being encouraged to learn and use a broad range of language learning strategies that can be tapped throughout the learning process. This approach is based on the belief that learning will be facilitated by making students aware of the range of strategies from which they can choose during language learning and use. The most efficient way to heighten learner awareness is to provide strategy training--explicit instruction in how to apply language learning strategies--as part of the foreign language curriculum. This digest discusses the goals of strategy training, highlights approaches to such training, and lists steps for designing strategy training programs. The guidelines for implementing strategy training programs provide a variety of options for  tailoring the training to meet the needs of a large number of students, as well as to the needs of the individual institution or language program. The most important considerations in the design of a strategy training program are the students' needs, the available resources (e.g, time, money, materials, availability of teacher trainers), and the feasibility of providing this kind of instruction.

          "Tedick, Diane J."],
        "description":"Modeled after the pioneering French immersion programs developed in Canada in the 1960s, foreign language immersion programs in the United States are designed to enrich the education of native-English-speaking students by teaching them all of their academic subjects in a second language. The goal is for students to become proficient in the second language and develop increased cultural awareness while reaching a high level of academic achievement. Students develop proficiency in the second language by hearing and using it to learn all of their school subjects rather than by studying the language itself. Parents who are considering an immersion program for their child usually have many questions. This digest provides introductory responses to some of the questions most commonly  posed by parents such as the following: What is a foreign language immersion program and how does it work? How will learning everything in a second language affect my child's English language and literacy development? Will my child become proficient in the second language? How long will that take? Is immersion an appropriate choice for all children? What can I do to support my child's immersion experience if I don't speak the second language? Immersion education offers an exciting opportunity for students to reach high levels of academic achievement and to acquire strong proficiency in English and another language. Parents who are interested in immersion for their children should become as well informed as possible about this program model. (Author/VWL)",

        "description":"This document addresses how well ARC's computerized placement tests (Compass) assist individuals in reaching informed decisions about enrolling in selected courses, including English composition, reading, mathematics, and ESL. The document addresses the question of whether Compass scores add any relevant information in the decision-making process surrounding course placement. To answer this question, evidence is considered based upon the test content, relations to future external variables, and consequences of testing, convergent data, and professional judgment. Data is analyzed for each subject test and tables of correlational data is provided for coefficients between Compass scores and grades under varying data conditions for English, Math, Reading and correlation coefficients  between Compass scores and grades for ESL. The study concludes that the original correlations are either very low, non-existent, or even negative. This means that counselors who believe that Compass tests should be given heavy weight are misguided and that entry decisions based partly upon Compass test outcomes are of dubious values. A possible solution is to have instructors of the same course write specific entrance skills that all students must have as a prerequisite to enrolling in a course. The document concludes with a list of implications for planning. (MZ)",

        "description":"This document discusses how service learning has developed over the past century in its practices from involvement in volunteerism to active civic engagement. It is so beneficial to both learners and the community that many educators and government leaders believe it should be a required component in the educational career of all students. The findings from a study about Service Learning and Problem-Based Learning concluded that student and teacher motivation substantially increased when combining Problem Based Learning (PBL) with Service Learning in the Communication classroom. Reciprocity of motivations exists between the teacher and her/his students. Students' communication skills improve, having successfully engaged in collaborative writing, speaking, and listening processes,  and public speaking opportunities and additionally students report transfer of communication skills to other settings. The data shows that this process causes students to move through all five levels of Bloom's (1964) Affective Taxonomy. By combining two pedagogies, students met or exceeded cognitive learning outcomes. It is important to understand the critical role of the teacher in combing the two pedagogies effectively because the immersion of the teacher in the student endeavors makes him/her a stakeholder in the project's outcomes.

        "description":"This paper seeks to answer some of the many questions that exist about credit-based transition programs. The paper reviews 45 published and unpublished reports, articles, and books on the most common credit-based transition programs: dual enrollment, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), Tech Prep, and middle college high schools (MCHS). The report examines the programs and their characteristics and reviews what is known about their ability to increase college access and success for a wide range of students. Though promoting college success for less-prepared students may seem counterintuitive, policy literature, program information, and practitioners advance a variety of arguments for why such programs can serve a wide variety of students. The benefits range  from preparing students for the academic rigors of college to improving students' motivation through interesting courses and high expectations. The report divides the programs into three categories: (1) Singleton Programs, which are stand-alone college-level courses; (2) Comprehensive Programs, which subsume most of a student's academic experience; and (3) Enhanced Comprehensive Programs, which offer students college coursework coupled with guidance and support to ensure their success. Research on the impact of these programs is at an early stage, and this report found few quantitative research reports that measured the effects of program participation. (Contains 49 references.)

Some of the highlights of the study follow: ACC's tuition rates are among the highest of any community college in Texas, creating access issues for many who most need the community college. ACC experienced a budget shortfall of $3.3 million in  FY01, and in the 2 subsequent years, cut its operating budget. The report recommends that ACC seek voter approval for increasing the College's tax rate and to issue general obligation bonds to address facilities and equipment needs. The report also recommends that ACC improve its strategies for tracking the progress of underrepresented students once they leave ACC, and that ACC should increase the transfer rates of underrepresented populations, especially African American and Hispanic students.

Some of the major CBS are student satisfaction, graduate satisfaction with preparation for transfer and preparation for career development, access to benefits of partnership, and the capacity to access information, expertise, technology assistance, and resources needed to be competitive in a global economy. Some of the major findings of the study are as follows: (1) over three fourths of Yavapai College  students were satisfied or very satisfied with how well they were prepared for transfer; (2) the number of occupational degrees awarded has decreased; and (3) students expressed high satisfaction with college services.

Findings indicate that over two-thirds of students want their classes to meet twice a week, while just over 20% want classes that meet once a week, and 10% want classes to meet three times a week. Respondents also preferred course sessions of either 15 or 8 weeks, rather than the shorter 2- and 5-week classes. Almost three-quarters of respondents attend GCCN  because of its proximity to their homes, while less than four percent attend because of its proximity to their work.

        "description":"This paper discusses the seven types of research tools that have potential for advancing knowledge about student services in California Community Colleges. The seven tools are the following: literature review, data validation, survey research, case study, quasi experiment, meta analysis, and statistical modeling. The report gives reasons why each research tool is important. An appreciation of their individual qualities as well as their complementary uses in various scenarios is instrumental in developing a multi-year plan of research. With the use of a hypothetical example, research in outreach for financial aid, the author demonstrates the nuances of the tools as they fit into a plan for research. The report concludes with these recommendations: (1) documentation and  dissemination of research is critical for researchers to link studies with other similar studies; (2) people need to recognize that research will have increased value if we can use it to help program staff in the field which means that program staff needs to have involvement in studies even if the staff may lack the experience and duties of a full time researcher; and (3) it is important to incorporate the concept of cost in the research program.

The survey was distributed to 100 faculty and staff members on the three college campuses. Thirty-one (31%) faculty and staff members responded to questions regarding three main areas: (1) Personnel; (2) Documents and Publications; and (3) Website. The purpose of the survey is to determine the satisfaction levels of faculty and staff with services provided by the OIRA office. 65% of respondents reported interacting with OIRA often or very often. Nearly 42% of respondents were staff members, while 29% were administrators and another 29% were faculty. While a baseline of 85% satisfaction is  commonly used, OIRA sets its sights on at least a 90% rating. 97% of respondents were satisfied with overall personnel characteristics, 97% were satisfied with overall reports/publications characteristics, and 98% were satisfied with the overall appearance of the website. Categorical results yielded lower satisfaction ratings for faculty than for the other respondent groups. 100% of administrators and staff were satisfied with OIRA personnel, while 90% of faculty were satisfied. The report recommends that steps be taken to improve the relationship between OIRA and faculty. Research instrument appended. (NB)",

        "description":"This study of three female preservice teachers who took part in a practicum teaching experience in Mexico focused on what the students learned, how they met the challenges of the experience, and how the experience affected their personal and professional lives later. This qualitative study used interviews with each student and observation field notes to investigate the relationships of the preservice teachers with their elementary school students and the Mexican cooperating teachers. Key changes in students views were identified. The students learned what it means to function in a new culture without language fluency and without familiarity with the standards for behavior. Students also gained significant insight into their own prejudices related to Mexico and Mexican people, and  they gained empathy for those who have to function in a new culture. Students left the program thinking that they would use the new insights as they developed ideas for teaching and for advocating for Hispanic children in their classes. Students comments revealed some profound growth in self-awareness about their own vulnerabilities. Most important to their future as teachers was their discovery that Mexican children were bright, capable, and working at grade level in spite of very limited school, family, and financial circumstances.

Building on the information processing theory of self-regulated learning (SRL) of P. Winne and colleagues, the study examined: (1) students' self-regulation; (2) co-regulation; and (3) the role of the teacher as an external regulator during a knowledge construction activity. Sixteen 11th and 12th graders were randomly assigned to one of two goal-setting instructional conditions (teacher-set goals (TSG)and learner generated sub-goals (LGSG)). Students used RiverWeb (tm), the simulation, collaboratively during a 3-week curriculum on  environmental science. The students' emerging understanding was assessed using their pretest and posttest scores, and was also assessed through an analysis of their discourse during several collaborative problem-solving episodes. The LGSG condition facilitated a shift in students' mental models significantly more than did the TSG condition. Students in the LGSG condition were also better at regulating and co-regulating their learning ability during the knowledge construction activity. In general, they planned and monitored their learning more efficiently by creating sub-goals, activating prior knowledge, and engaging in adaptive help-seeking. They also used more effective learning strategies and were more effective in handling task difficulties and demands than was the TSG group. Results  provide an initial characterization of the complexity of self- and co-regulated learning in a complex, dynamic technology-enhanced student-centered classroom.

        "description":"This paper details the efforts of four organizations that have been able to negotiate their environments effectively, in the hopes that the analysis provides insights into how organizations are able to establish valuable learning environments for youth in nonschool hours. The negotiation, the process of dealing with various layers of environments and systems, that contributes to the effectiveness of these organizations and their capacity to work successfully with youth. The 4 organizations were selected from 32 organizations in the San Francisco Bay area involved in a study of youth organizations and the learning environments they promote. The four organizations are: (1) a multiservice community center that offers youth of all ages opportunities to participate in a diverse array  of programs; (2) a program to help high school youth develop action projects; (3) a community center that draws on community resources and cultural surroundings to run programs in local schools and the neighborhood; and (4) a Boys and Girls Club in a distressed neighborhood. These organizations have been successful in negotiating in external contexts because they have used the neighborhoods as learning resources, learned to work with the schools, and developed collaborative atmospheres in low-income areas. The four organizations look and are quite different, but they have all made choices about supporting youth and creating strong learning environments. The examples in this paper suggest some ways other organizations can make better or more effective choices to support youth development  and learning. (Contains 19 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the institution of content standards-driven curriculum in secondary English language arts and mathematics has led to student success on the California High School Exit Exam. The study tested the hypothesis that the increased focus on the alignment of English language arts and mathematics curriculum has had a positive impact on the passing scores of students who have been increasingly instructed with standards-based curriculum. Data were collected through survey questionnaires completed by English and Algebra teachers at two comprehensive and four alternative secondary schools and from school district and state records. A majority of site principals and the teachers surveyed concur that teachers are well prepared for  the task of readying students for the California High School Exit Examination. Principals at the comprehensive sites agree that students have adequate knowledge of the exit exam and that the school sites and the district office are providing adequate knowledge of such facets as test components and testing dates to both students and parents. Alternative site principals do not entirely agree on this point. Teachers also generally agree that adequate activities and materials are provided for teachers who are responsible for preparing students for the exit examination. Teachers also believe the curriculum in use is either mostly or fully aligned with the academic content standards. Data from the administrations of the exit examination show that student scores are steadily rising. This is true  for all students, including those in special-needs and English learner subgroups. It is important to note that scores for the subgroups are still lower than for the general population. Three appendixes contain the surveys and cover letters. (Contains 6 tables 38 references.)

        "description":"This paper presents aspects of a study that aims to describe and make sense of changes over time in the intellectual field of mathematics education research. Drawing on the work of B. Bernstein, especially his essay on intellectual fields and knowledge structures, the paper seeks to raise questions about the fields standing in the wider field of intellectual knowledge production, the position of the fields actors in their own field, and their positioning vis-a-vis the official and public discourses and everyday school practice. Underpinning these questions is the view that changes in power relations are inscribed in the form of research activity that shapes the field, and that such changes are expressed in the mode of regulation that affects the identities of actors in the field.  To study changes in the form of specialization of research activity and to give a systematic yet critical account of the field, researchers produced an empirical description and at the same time attempted to generate a language capable of showing the effects of that which it describes. The method of working was to look at a representative sample of published papers in the field to develop a tool for recording and analyzing these texts, and to create a model to help interpret the data. As well as presenting and demonstrating the usefulness of the analytical tool in the resulting description of the data, the paper sketches a provisional picture about the state of the field that captures the changing nature of its discourse, and depicts the positions it creates for the actors in the field,  through the resources it makes available to them. This provides evidence to argue that researchers identities in mathematics education research bear the mark of a historical turn in educational studies, the knowledge structure of teacher education, toward its technologizing,\" and also the marks of the current mode of its regulation, which tends to produce identities with products that have an exchange value either in their own field or the field of supposed application.

In Mississippi, the ARC program is referred to as the America Reads-Mississippi (ARM) program. In 1999, 37 schools in 25 school districts participated in this program, sponsored by 3 regional centers in Mississippi. An evaluation was conducted to study program history, examine impact on student reading achievement and student attitudes, and determine the attitudes of volunteer tutors, regional coordinators and assistant coordinators, and site supervisors (n=13). Findings show that principals did not have time to serve as site supervisors, and program implementation varied among program sites. However, standardized  achievement test scored improved for students involved in ARM, and reading performance improved. Students in the program enjoyed reading, and tutors appear to be beneficial in helping students interest and proficiency in reading. Tutors themselves had positive attitudes about the program, although they thought more training would be useful. Recommendations are made for program improvement. (Contains 19 references.) (SLD)",

Evaluations of these programs are reviewed. The proposed voucher program for Louisiana is described. Issues surrounding vouchers are discussed, as are the reasons voters have rejected vouchers in some places. Research findings about vouchers have been mixed, with some studies suggesting that they increase student achievement and parent and student satisfaction, and other studies indicating that they do not have these  effects. Commentary by the individual authors is presented, with one author making the point that limiting private school autonomy may be too great a price to pay to participate in voucher programs.

These evaluation measures are based on what faculty and administrators consider to be characteristics of effective college teaching, with little or no input from students. Although recent research has documented what college students think are attributes of effective primary and secondary teachers, scant information exists about what students perceive to be characteristics of effective college teachers. Thus, this qualitative study used a multistage concurrent mixed-methodological analysis to examine students perceptions of the characteristics of effective college teachers as a function of several demographic  variables (e.g., students gender, age, year of study, major). Participants were 912 undergraduate and graduate students from various academic majors enrolled at a university in a mid-southern state. In order of endorsement level, a phenomenological analysis revealed the following nine characteristics that students considered to reflect effective college teaching: (1) student-centered (58.88%); (2) knowledgeable about subject matter (44.08%); (3) professional (40.79%); (4) enthusiastic about teaching (29.82%); (5) effective at communication (23.46%); (6) accessible (23.25%); (7) competent at instruction (21.82%); (8) fair and respectful (21.60%); and (9) provider of adequate performance feedback (5.04%). These themes were related to a variety of demographic variables. (Contains 1 figure, 5  tables, and 58 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Analyses were for all 66 school districts in a Southern state. Results indicate there may be a relationship between the percent of students with disabilities receiving their education in general education classes and indicators of educational results. It has been asserted that the movement toward greater inclusion leads to greater positive educational results for students with disabilities. The findings of significant correlations of greater inclusion to higher rates of high school diplomas and of eighth-grade test passage are encouraging. (Contains 5 figures and 13  references.)

        "description":"The state of Louisiana has commissioned several pilot projects to design, implement, and evaluate a teacher leader curriculum leading to eligibility for the new teacher leader certificate. The purpose of this paper is to describe one of these pilots, the St. Charles Teacher Leader Institute (TLI), which was implemented as a partnership between the St. Charles Parish public schools, Louisiana, and the University of New Orleans. The first part of the paper describes the TLIs design and implementation structure. The second part summarizes an outside evaluation of the program, and the third identifies some lessons learned in the design and implementation of the pilot project. The TLI included the equivalent of nine credit hours of graduate course work and spanned parts of two  academic semesters. It integrated the study of school leadership with an array of field-based problem solving and school improvement activities. The TLI used an electronic, Web-based instructional support system. Each student designed, enacted, and evaluated a project that supported the schools current improvement plan, and they then presented and defended their proposal, budget, and evaluation plan. The external evaluation, which drew on focus groups of participants, interviews with professors, and other sources of data, found that the program increased the pool of potential principals. The evaluation identified some reasons for staying in the program and other reasons for leaving it. In spite of complaints about the amount of time required to complete the assignments and the ambiguity  students experienced, they felt successful and were positive about the substance of the program. A primary lesson learned from the program is the importance of partnership. Also identified as important was the outside funding provided by the BellSouth Foundation, which helped attract and retain students. An appendix summarizes topics, activities, and performances.

        "description":"National Court Reporters Association (NCRA)-approved court reporting programs offer a curriculum based on criteria and standards in \"General Requirements and Minimum Standards.\" Declining enrollments have resulted in closure of reporter programs of all sizes and institution type. Factors negatively affecting public perception of court reporting as a career are media reports that predict its replacement by alternative technologies; negative media reports on reporter performance in high-profile cases; and reporters' negative statements on declining financial opportunities and working conditions. Individual schools' aggressive promotion increases enrollments. The rate at which students exit programs prior to graduation has not worsened, but moderately improved; yet it remains at an  unacceptably high level. Reasons cited are program difficulty; extremely complex manual dexterity, mental skills, and excellent language skills required; and cost. Successful students are single, childless, employed part-time or not at all, avid readers, and enrolled full-time; have good grammar and keyboarding skills; and have received faculty motivation. NCRA's student recruitment and education initiative integrates programs of work in these four key areas: public relations to improve the profession's image; emphasis on student recruitment; reinventing realtime reporter education; and a federal initiative. NCRA has renewed its commitment to promoting higher levels of education. (YLB)",

In 1999-2000 roughly two-thirds of working undergraduates aged 24 or older reported that work was their primary activity, and among these nearly 70% combined full-time work with part-time attendance. These working adults make up a large percentage of the undergraduate population and nearly one-half received some sort of financial aid, including one-quarter who received aid from their employers. However, full-time work and part-time attendance combined with family responsibilities appeared to be barriers to  completing a credential. Despite the fact that most employees who study thought it was important to earn a formal credential, 62% had not done so within 6 years. Moreover, among those who left, most did so in their first year. In contrast, their counterparts whose focus was on postsecondary enrollment students who work experienced more positive educational outcomes. These students, who were more likely to have fewer family responsibilities, were more likely to earn postsecondary credentials, especially bachelor's degrees.

Some of the conclusions are as follows: (1) community colleges are providing CTE courses via distance learning to meet the needs of students by increasing access and convenience, but not  to reduce costs; (2) lack of faculty interest and program development costs are the primary reasons for not offering CTE courses via distance learning; (3) a significant portion of community college CTE courses are offered via distance learning; (4) community colleges are offering few CTE programs that can be completed fully via distance learning; (5) enrollments in distance learning courses and programs are expected to increase; (6) distance learning CTE courses attract more working professionals, employed students, and single parents compared to on-campus classes; and (7) Internet-based courses are the most prominent form of distance learning.

The immigrant population increased from 19.8 million in 1990 to 31.1 million in 2000, comprising 11.1% of the U.S. population and 12.4% of the nation's workforce. Immigrants are expected to account for half of the working-age population growth between 2006 and 2015 and for all of the growth between 2016 and 2035, yet they are concentrated in low-skill, low-pay jobs. Some of the challenges that keep immigrants in working poverty are as follows: (1) immigration status; (2) inaccessibility of job training and placement programs; (3) rarity of job-based benefits; (4) ineligibility for government programs; and (5)  discrimination and exploitation in the workplace. Some of the recommendations to funders to improve conditions are as follows: (1) enhance language access to programs; (2) integrate job training with English-acquisition and cultural orientation; (3) develop workforce programs that forge multisector partnerships; (4) help immigrants gain fair recognition and receive accreditation for their skills and education; (5) successfully educate children of immigrants; (6) educate and develop the leadership of immigrant workers; (7) protect immigrant workers who risk intimidation for union activities; and (8) improve public policy, employer practices, and economic outcomes for low-wage immigrants.

The introduction states that a series of thematic workshops addressed such adult education contexts and approaches as democracy, poverty, literacy, work, gender, health and environment, higher education institutions, teacher training, and museums, libraries and cultural heritage; five sessions were held on regional views; and four working groups highlighting major issues were devoted to the following: (1) rethinking of and advocacy for  adult learning in the light of international agendas; (2) policy: structuring, finance, partnerships; (3) monitoring adult education; and (4) increasing participation in adult learning. An analysis of adult education and learning since 1997 includes findings in the following areas: (1) understanding adult learning; (2) making policies for adult learning; (3) structuring adult learning; (4) adult learning for what?; (5) participating in adult learning; (6) enhancing the quality of adult learning; (7) cultivating partnerships in adult learning; and (8) investing in adult learning.

Traditional career development theories and models assume that: everyone has a free choice among careers; career development is a linear, progressive, rational process; and individualism, autonomy and centrality of work are universal values. Career development research sometimes neglects important determinants such as racism, sexism, family background and opportunity structure in racial and ethnic minority populations. Career development practitioners must be prepared to work with clients in culturally sensitive and appropriate ways and should be aware of factors that affect the career choices of diverse individuals. These factors include world view (such as  cooperation/communality versus competitive/individualistic, individualist versus collectivist), identity (racial, gender, group, bicultural), values (career, cultural), and context (internal and external barriers and resources). Culturally competent practitioners recognize how and why individuals' career-related experiences might be different and think outside their own cultural frames of reference in assisting people with their career development.

Entrepreneurs must be self-starters, innovative, willing to try new things and take risks; they must be able to get along with others and be receptive to suggestions and criticism; they must be able to look at a situation, identify opportunities, gather resources, make business plans, and be persistent. Career and technical education (CTE) can help students develop these skills by integrating entrepreneurship education with academic and technical curricula that stresses financial, people  management, interpersonal/communication, and business planning skills. Of significance in promoting entrepreneurship are curriculum approaches and delivery techniques that motivate students to stay connected to school and learn the skills required to succeed as small business owners. Flexibility in program structure and delivery, cultural competence, and collaboration are key components to entrepreneurship programs. (Contains 15 references.) (CG)",

Careers are now considered to be more fluid, nonlinear and unstable and the later career stage can be a period of growth, maintenance, or decline. Adults in late midlife are a diverse group with varied career development needs such as the opportunity to change jobs within an organization, learn new skills or use their skills in different ways. These five suggestions can provide some direction both to older adults and to those assisting them with their career development: (1) acknowledge that  careers belong to individuals; (2) learn how to find and use career information; (3) prepare for unplanned disruptions in careers; (4) provide role models for older employees; and (5) view career from a holistic and connected perspective. More research and theory development are needed to understand fully what career development interventions are appropriate for older adults. (Contains 15 references.) (CG)",

The Arkansas Legislature mandated that the Arkansas Department of Education identify high schools with &quot;statistically significant variance&quot; between students' grade point averages (GPAs) and ACT performances. A grade inflation index developed and applied to the high schools found 46 schools with inflated grades. These schools were listed in the newspaper. Examination of grade inflation at one rural school revealed many problems with identifying such schools. The paper suggests that the practice of &quot;accusing&quot; schools of inflating grades based on only 1 year of data is irresponsible. For the rural school, in only 1 of 5 years would the school have been identified under the  state's formula as having inflated grades. Another problem with the statistical analysis used to indict this and similar schools was the sample. Rural schools often have small numbers in their senior classes. A sample ratio analysis utilizing these small numbers cannot be reliable due to the large amount of variability in small samples. Other variables were also not considered in the grade inflation issue (students identified as having inflated grades also had 3.0 or higher GPAs in college, and all students at the school in question who might consider attending college are encouraged to take the ACT, not just high achievers).

Two Likert-scale surveys examined their perceptions of the importance of 11 leadership skills and of the extent to which they attained growth in each skills. Results found little variation in the relative importance participants assigned to the skills. Confidence  emerged as the most important skill, followed by two skills that involved the participation of others in tasks undertaken by the teacher leader. Participants varied more widely in their assessment of personal growth in leadership skills. They perceived the greatest growth in knowledge of educational issues and understanding leadership styles. Initially, most participants defined leadership under the figurehead category. Midway through the program, half of them changed to define leadership in terms of the cheerleader/team player category.

The goal of this study is to explore which factors affect elementary education candidates' integration of technology into their instruction during field placement. A multiple regression analysis was conducted on seniors' responses to a survey administered immediately after completion of the field placement experience. Results revealed that four predictors accounted for 24.8 percent of the variance in candidates' reported integration of technology into their  field placement instruction. Significant findings showed that candidates tended to integrate a higher degree of technology into their instruction if they reported high general technology proficiency, if more technology was available in their classroom, and if their mentor teachers used technology more frequency. However, a belief about technology being motivating was not a strong predictor. (Author/SM)",

Parents completed self-report questionnaires examining activities they were currently involved in and activities they would like to do in their children's classrooms. Out of 208 surveys distributed, 114 were returned. Twelve K-3 teachers completed interviews regarding levels of parental involvement in their classrooms. Results were organized by: what parents would like to do and actually do in the classroom; level of parental involvement in the classroom; and level of parental involvement based on the teacher interviews. More than half of parents reported they would like to have lunch with their children, attend field trips, and visit or  observe the classroom. More than 10 percent of parents participated in activities they liked doing. Of the 12 teachers, 3 reported having formal, structural involvement in their classrooms, 6 reported having high-level involvement, and 3 reported having low-level involvement. High parent involvement levels related to participation in activities that parents liked to do in the classroom. Findings suggest that by identifying activities parents are interested in, parents are able to be involved in their children's education. However, there is a need for teachers to provide such activities to increase the level of parent involvement. (SM)",

Two students from each group also completed a brief interview about their perceptions of the video and medium they watched it on. Results indicated that the low-bandwidth, low-quality nature of the streaming video did impact the affective meanings that participants received from the streaming video. Participants viewing the videotape tended to rate the video higher on items concerning the overall  experience than did participants who viewed the streaming video. Those who viewed the streaming video tended to be more divided in their responses than did those who viewed the videotape, and they also seemed to miss some of the subtleties of the video.

Critics point out that the original work was nothing more than a literature review, no data were collected, and much of the information presented was anecdotal in nature. Proponents of the existence of the chilly climate maintain that women are, in fact, treated differently from men both in and out of the classroom, and this differential treatment negatively impacts their performance in college. Over the past 20 years, empirical research on the chilly climate for women has yielded conflicting results. While some  authors have focused exclusively on the classroom environment, others have included the campus environment as well. This review of literature on the chilly climate for women includes a historical overview of the major reports and studies that substantiate its existence as well as data that refute it, and the various tools that have been used for measuring chilly climate.

Recent data from several sources show that the opportunities for tenure are declining, while the numbers of nontenure positions are increasing. Part of the increase in full-time nontenure faculty is due to the decrease of federal and state aid to higher education institutions during the early 1990s. Other external factors include loss of public confidence in higher education, federal policies that influence faculty personnel policies, the cost of technology, the flexibility required for distance education, increased competition for students, downsizing trends, and criticisms of tenure. Many internal factors have been cited as contributing to this  trend, including the dynamics of the academic labor market. Many concerns have been voiced about the increased reliance on contingent faculty, but some positive results have been noted, especially with regard to economic factors and flexibility. The continued rise in the employment of contract faculty is a significant trend that is likely to have a lasting impact. A positive outcome of these changes most likely depends on the ability of administrators and faculty to meet each other halfway to ensure the quality of student learning and some degree of job security in challenging financial times.

        "description":"To cover the costs of college, students and their families are using loans, grants, savings, and, increasingly, a specific type of college savings plan known as a &quot;529.&quot; These planned are named after a Section of the Internal Revenue Code that confers tax exemption to qualified state tuition programs. There are two types of 529 plans: prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans. With a prepaid plan, families may purchase future tuition years or units. College savings plans allow families to establish, and contribute to, a special savings or investment account dedicated to a student's future higher education expenses at any accredited postsecondary institution. The most appealing benefit for many families is the tax saving. As of January 1, 2002, the earnings on these accounts  are exempt from federal taxes, provided the money is used for educational expenses. There are some drawbacks, chief of which is the investment risk of college savings plans. The assumptions on which many prepaid tuition plans were established proved to be faulty, as tuition rates have risen faster than investment income from the plans. Several states have temporarily stopped accepting applications for these plans. In spite of these complications, however, interest and investment in Section 529 college savings plans is growing. In September 2003, a new type, the Independent 529 plan, was opened. This plan will allow families to prepay for any one of more than 220 private colleges and universities that are participating. This plan hopes to avoid the problems of others by having the  participating colleges assume the risk that if tuition increases outpace investment returns, they will not receive full payment. (SLD)",

        "description":"According to the latest report by the Institute of International Education, 586,323 foreign students studied in the United States in the 2002-2003 academic year. Foreign students benefit U.S. colleges and universities in many ways, including economic contributions and the value of their work as teachers and researchers, but there has been increased concern about foreign students since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The United States began establishing a student tracking system in the mid-1990s, and following the September 11 attacks, Congress authorized more than $36 million to implement and expand the tracking system. The Student and Exchange Visitors System (SEVIS) was completed to allow officials to collect information about foreign students and exchange  visitors. Schools enrolling foreign students are required to report certain information about student enrollment and changes to address, name, or field of study. SEVIS has faced a number of challenges, especially because of difficulties in meeting tight deadlines for implementation. The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement has begun working to reduce the backlog in student visas and ensure that students from schools pending certification can gain entry into the United States.

A number of fundamental challenges to effective governance occur within the typical university environment, including too many constituencies, conflicting agendas, differing philosophies, traditions, and differences in perspectives among stakeholder. There are some core governance-related issues for the 21st century, especially: (1) technology and distance learning; (2) teaching and learning; and (3) resource allocation. A new model for governance may be in order for the university of the future, a model that places the attitudes, values, and expectations of internal and external stakeholders at  the center. In this model, inputs, processes, outputs, and outcomes are all mediated by stakeholders' attitudes, values, and expectations. The university of the future is already evolving, and the necessary governance structures are beginning to evolve as well. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)",

The study investigated the effects of use of Mathematica, a computer algebra system, in learning basic linear algebra concepts, It was done by means of comparing two first year linear algebra classes, one traditional and one Mathematica implemented class. A total of fifty-five students participated. Each class had a different instructor; The traditional class was taught by a professor in the mathematics department, and the experimental class was taught by the investigator. Students enrolled in each section were used in the study. They were no told the nature of the experiment until after the enrollment was completed. The traditional section was in lecture format whereas the  experimental section was in mostly discovery format; Students in the experimental group discovered definitions of basic abstract concepts mostly through visual-based Mathematica notebook demonstration, whereas the students in the traditional group were given the definitions. Data was collected through a background questionnaire, post questionnaire, pre-test scores, post-test scores, interviews and observation notes. This study discusses a variety of comparison between the traditional and the experimental classes. The data shed light on a range of differences in understanding basic linear algebra concepts.

        "description":"The Comprehensive Partnerships for Mathematics and Science Achievement (CPMSA) is a National Science Foundation program launched in 1993, designed to improve the mathematics and science education of urban students in medium-sized cities. The goals of the program, in addition to increased enrollments in mathematics and science classes, were to improve student achievement, teacher knowledge and skills, and to enhance student interest in mathematics and science careers. As the program matured, the focus shifted to standards-based curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development. This report highlights the achievements of the program overall and presents case studies of five selected CPMSA sites: (1) Omaha, Nebraska; (2) Jackson, Michigan; (3) Laredo, Texas; Oakland,  California; and (5) Montgomery, Alabama. Data were collected from a variety of sources. Findings show that the primary goal of increasing the enrollment and successful completion of college preparatory mathematics and science courses was accomplished. Other measures of achievement also showed positive results; 12 of 17 sites with available data showed improvement in the percentage of students passing the fourth-grade mathematics test. Disparities in achievement and achievement gaps between white and minority students were narrowed. Details are provided about program success in each of the case study cities. An appendix describes overall student outcomes in 26 exhibits. (Contains 4 tables, 72 figures, and 65 references.) (SLD)",

The purpose was to develop common benchmarks and a common report card. Subsequently, the consortium received a 3-year grant in 2001 from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education to supplement major funding by the participating states. The model project is built on four premises: (1) a valid and reliable report card must compare like institutions having common missions and common goals; (2) the report card should emphasize excellence and best practices; (3) the benchmark must be based on consistently applied and nationally recognized standards, such as those  validated by a recognized authority in the field; and (4) every aspect of data collection, processing, and verification must be consistent to ensure accuracy and a \"level playing field\" among the participating institutions and states. The project is in its third year. This interim report presents several outcomes from the first 2 years and expresses opinions about what would occur in the third year and beyond. So far, the yield of positive and unexpected results has proved invaluable to all. (Author/SLD)",

Using survey returns from 521 active researchers, the paper goes on to describe the techniques that the field can use, and those where further \"training\" or experience is required. Using the 8,691 individual Research Assessment Exercise returns (from a survey of higher education research activities), the paper then summarizes the methods reported to be in actual use. Finally, it uses a brief analysis of journal contents as triangulating evidence. The  informants were generally in agreement that there is currently a widespread weakness in the quality of UK education research. Much of this weakness is attributed by them to a shortage of skills in quantitative methods. Other data sources suggest that the latter is less likely than the informants believe. A clear majority of education researchers report having used quantitative methods, and the substantial number of publications involving quantitative methods supports this view. It is, perhaps, rather the type and quality of both quantitative and qualitative research that leads to the poor public image of education research. Improvement is not going to come simply by enlarging the group of people using quantitative methods. Two appendixes provide information about the data collected.  (Contains 23 references.) (SLD)",

It focuses on the following: The Advent of Whole Language in ESL/EFL Study; Teaching from a Constructivist Perspective; Constructivist Reading: An Interactive Process; and Student-Centered, Teacher-Moderated, Text-Rich Approach. The paper concludes that there is enormous support for a whole language approach to ESL/EFL reading education, with very few studies disagreeing with whole language or constructivism. A strong majority of educators doing research in the field have adopted this view, and all of the classroom methods they advocate share  common elements related to certain general principles (integration of reading as a component of language along with writing, speaking, and listening; a constructivist approach in reading instruction that builds on students' prior knowledge of and experience with language; the idea of reading as an interactive process between text and reader to build meaning; and the advocacy of a learning situation that is student centered but teacher monitored in a text-rich environment).

        "description":"Researchers have discovered that learners' language learning beliefs play a crucial role in influencing learners' choices throughout the learning process. Some researchers suggest that understanding learners' beliefs about language learning can help improve their learning skills. Educators in Taiwan have long been concerned about learners' English language learning. However, few studies have been devoted to exploring the relationship between learners' language learning beliefs and their proficiency levels. This study investigated differences in the beliefs that high-English-proficiency and low-English-proficiency learners held about English learning. Data were collected from two high school classes via interviews and surveys. Results revealed significant belief discrepancies  between high-English-proficiency and low-English-proficiency learners in five areas (foreign language WP, the difficulty of language learning, the nature of language learning, learning and communication strategies, and motivation). High-proficiency learners tended to have more positive language learning beliefs than low-proficiency learners. Instructional implications are noted. Two appendixes present sample interview questions and items with statistically significant differences. (Contains 16 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This paper examines problems in U.S. English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) programs, focusing on the stories of three Chinese ESL learners from immigrant families. All three of these people had been long-term ESL students in New York City (they had been enrolled in ESL programs for 4-8 years but had not mastered the cognitive and academic skills in English needed to compete at grade level). In describing their ESL programs, the students reported such things as never having had any textbooks in their ESL classes, seldom being given any homework, never receiving help for math or other subjects, and not learning anything. One student had a good first-year ESL teacher who helped students with math and science and taught them English. However, she never tested out of the ESL classes and  reported that the ESL class was called a \"class for the retarded.\" The paper concludes that much of ESL education fails because the programs hold no standards or clearly defined expectations for their learners and because the urgent needs of ESL students are not well understood or adequately addressed. It also fails because many ESL classes are conducted by poorly trained teachers. (SM)",

The role of oral language proficiency, specifically vocabulary, in the phonological awareness of bilingual children is also explored. Bilingual kindergartners and first graders in English or Spanish literacy instruction and a comparison group of monolingual English-speaking peers were administered tests of expressive vocabulary in English and Spanish and a phonemic segmentation task in English. Bilingual children, particularly those with higher Spanish language proficiencies, tended to  hypersegment long diphthongized vowels. English language proficiency predicted correct performance on English phonemic segmentation more powerfully for children with low Spanish language proficiency and for children in English literacy instruction. For Spanish-instructed children, Spanish language proficiency predicted English phonemic segmentation, suggesting cross-language transfer. (Contains 32 references.) (Author/SM)",

        "description":"This paper asserts that while predicting in listening is a very important listening skill and listening habit, English language learners are often reluctant to use prediction. It recommends that teachers should work to cultivate students' predicting ability so that the students can form a natural and effective listening habit and can predict based on the topic, topic sentence, key words, sentence development, grammatical relations, and logical development. The paper focuses on the following: how people listen in their native language; how English learners listen in English; the cognitive process of predicting; predicting as a pre-listening activity; helping students to predict (prediction in the before-listening stage and prediction while listening); and sentence-by-sentence  prediction (e.g., sentence-by-sentence is the natural predicting process in listening, the stock formula of the language helps listeners to predict, and the stress on a particular word in the first part of an utterance is often explained or clarified by a comment in the second). The paper concludes that teachers must remind their students that prediction and guessing is a good thing in foreign language listening and must encourage them to do so. (SM)",

However, few empirical studies have explored that effectiveness of strategy training in improving learners' target language learning. The effectiveness of strategy training on language learning is still not conclusive. This study evaluates a semester-long language learning strategy course in terms of its effect on the target language learning process. Moreover, the long-term effect of the training is examined. The study participants were 47 Taiwanese college students who were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group participants attended the language strategy training course, while the  control group participants did not receive the strategy training. The main findings address the effectiveness of strategy training on students' target language learning in terms of their improvement in strategy use, the affective domain, and proficiency levels. Factors that might hinder students' strategy application are also identified. (Contains 40 references.) (Author/SM)",

        "author":["Fritz, Kathleen M."],
        "description":"During academic year 2001-02, approximately 165 students in eight sections of Introductory Spanish and French completed weekly online quizzes as part of their final grades. While most of them completed traditional quizzes, two third-semester Spanish classes completed multimedia listening comprehension quizzes based on audio and video from the Web. All of the quizzes were accessed from the University's Blackboard account. Students were instructed to log in and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the assignment. This paper focuses on creation of the traditional quiz; creation of the multimedia quizzes; and saving and making available the quizzes. It also presents results from anonymous online student surveys that asked about students' experiences with the digital quizzes.  Results indicate that the weekly quizzes were viable for foreign language classes. Because the students successfully manipulated the new medium, between 10-15 minutes of class time were saved each week, which were more profitably used in the mastery of course material. Instructor time was also greatly conserved since the quizzes were self-correcting and self-tabulating. Disadvantages to using the Blackboard system included the integrity of the examination process itself (since students were unsupervised during their quizzes) and, for the quiz creator, locating stable, appropriate, and archived audio/video for the multimedia quizzes.

Advantages include multiple mentoring opportunities and the ability to reach more learners. Challenges include identifying learners who can succeed at a distance, training teachers, funding, and assessment and accountability. Implementing video-based distance education involves accessing videos and providing instructional support. Suggestions for implementation include using forms (goal setting forms, study plan forms, and learner logs) and building community among learners to prevent learner isolation. Evaluation studies provide evidence that video-based  distance education programs are popular with students and attract many who may be unwilling or unable to attend traditional classes. Teachers report that students in video-based distance education programs make education gains.

It explains that learning to read is especially difficult for adults learning to read in a second language. According to the research, all English language learners (ELLs), regardless of the type of L1 literacy in their background, need direct teaching in the English symbol system and in English sound-symbol correspondences. In 2001, 42 percent of adults enrolled in state-administered, federally-funded adult education programs were enrolled in English-as-a-Second-Language classes. These adults come from diverse backgrounds and have widely differing experiences with literacy in their first languages. These  factors must be considered in all areas of instructional program planning, student placements, and instructional approaches. The brief examines six types of L1 literacy and their impact on ELLs' development of English language literacy: limited literate learners (preliterate, nonliterate, and semiliterate learners) and literate learners (non-alphabet literate, non-Roman alphabet literate, and Roman alphabet literate learners).

Among individual groups, the highest retention rate of 76.9% was for Black non-Hispanic students. The rate was 75.1% for Hispanic students and 71.8% for White non-Hispanic students. The study also calculated the combined graduation and retention rate. This figure for the Black non-Hispanic students was 79.9%, which not only represents the group's highest for the 5 years studied, but also exceeds the rates of the other major ethnic groups. The retention plus graduation rate for White non-Hispanic  students was also at its highest level, 78.2% in 2001. Additionally, the retention rate for new students peaked at 80.3% in 2001. All major ethnic groups achieved higher retention and were led by Black non-Hispanic students at 81% and White non-Hispanic students at 74.4%.

        "description":"This document discusses the American sport baseball as a metaphor to help describe a way to measure, comprehend and visualize student progression through the American community college. This analysis is based on data from the Transfer and Retention of Urban Community College Students (TRUCCS) study. TRUCCS is a longitudinal study of 5,000 community college students from the nine campuses of the Los Angeles Community College District. The study used a 47-item questionnaire on the community college experience. The questionnaire was administered during the Spring 2001 semester to 5,000 students across 241 classrooms. Complete transcripts were also collected as part of the study. Of the total TRUCCS sample, 66% (n=3,318) indicated an intention to transfer. Results indicated that only  about half of the students had made any progress towards transferring. Discusses some possible reasons for students not progressing in their transfer efforts. The study finds that it typically takes 9.5 semesters for students to become transfer ready, thus providing evidence against the notion of a &quot;two year&quot; college. It analyzes differences in groups based on gender, ethnicity, age, and native language. Appendix A contains a list of the kinds classes that fulfill the partial completion of transfer requirements as specified by the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) in California.

The three key questions in creating an effective assessment for each school are: (1) what do faculty members expect students to learn; (2) can it be demonstrated that students have learned; and (3) how can the results of the assessment be used to help student learning. There are two modes of assessment: direct assessment and indirect assessment. The document explores various methods and tools in carrying out assessment of student learning outcomes. Four key areas of student learning general education, program/major, basic skills, and students and academic  support services. Issues of access and equity are discussed in the last section of the report and are essential components of an effective assessment program. It is stressed that assessment is a never-ending process that must provide ongoing feedback to help improve student learning and insure student success. The document concludes with a list of definitions, a bibliography, including websites, and a variety of examples of assessment related materials for two-year colleges.

Students who registered for Spring 2003 classes via the Internet were funneled through a brief survey. Survey results indicate that 59% of students aimed to complete a program, 23% aimed to complete 1 or 2 courses, 8% aimed to complete several courses but not a program, and 10% were undecided. About 58% of respondents expected to complete their program within 2 years, while 26% of Associate's Degree students expected to take more than 2 years to complete their degrees. Also, 56% of respondents were program-enrolled and, of those, 89% intended to complete a program. Findings indicate 26% of respondents were preparing to get a job, 21%  were taking courses for personal interest, and 9% had no definite purpose. About 6% of respondents were preparing to transfer to another college. These numbers indicate that students at WCTC might benefit from career exploration services. The paper also argues that failure to complete a program is not necessarily a failure of retention, as substantial numbers of students do not intend to complete a program. (NB)",

In the last 10 years, community colleges have begun using new approaches towards developmental education. They include the following: (1) successful collaboration between high school and community colleges; (2) model 2-year and 4-year partnerships; (3) service learning programs on community college campuses; and (4) urban community college systems configured to serve  as &quot;Gateways to Democracy.&quot; The document discusses recent trends in remedial education as explained by two major studies completed by the American Association of Community Colleges and the National Study of Community College Remediation.

Certain national trends, economic trends, and labor market trends have created implications for vocational and technical education in California. For example, the volume of the educational opportunities must increase greatly to meet the demands created by California's rapidly increasing population. Therefore, it is necessary that California community colleges create a kind of vocational and technical education that is technically sound and up-to-date as well as academically vigorous and culturally inclusive. The document discusses the five priorities of the California  State Plan, which include performance accountability, curriculum development and improvement, professional development, student support structures, and partnership development. The document also addresses the recommendations made by the California's Field Review Committee on the development of vocational education in many areas including linkage and partnerships, student support services, student organizations, and funding. The document also addresses California's three components of nontraditional indicators, which address programs leading to employment in nontraditional occupations and the relationship between participation rates and completion rates.

        "description":"This study focuses on students enrolled in academic CPR workshops in the summer of 2002. The goal of the study is to examine changes in the population of students with academic problems. The CPR workshops are a requirement for students that are subject to dismissal. The study was conducted in the summer of 2003 on the telephone with a random sample of 20 of the 304 students. These are some of the conclusions that were drawn based on the interviews: (1) students were satisfied with the workshops giving it a score of 7.9 out 10; (2) students found the content of the workshops to be useful, especially time management skills; (3) students expressed that barriers to success were objective test taking and limited tutoring and counseling; and (4) students accepted responsibility for  being on academic probation. Based on these findings, this document makes several recommendations: (1) future studies should be done with a larger sample; (2) future studies should be done right after the end of the summer classes so that the students have more fresh memories; and (3) since workshops appear to be effective, it would be wise to expand these workshops in the future.

The students that were studied were required to visit a dedicated follow up counselor prior to enrolling in classes in order to assist them in designing an achievable academic plan. The data gathered came from 68 students in fall 2000 and 85 students in Spring 2001. The study found that study skills counseling alone resulted in increased persistence and higher GPA's even though those students did not self-report improved study habits. Furthermore, follow up counseling is most strongly related to an increase in retention and persistence and a decrease in the number of units attempted without a decrease in the number of units completed.  Although there was a lack of increase in GPA, this may be due to the difficulty of raising grades in a short amount of time. Outreach efforts appeared to occur at a level sufficient to attract interested students. Future analysis will explore the number of visits to other counselors, planned work hours, educational goals and other potentially influencing factors. (MZ)",

        "description":"This report discusses how in Wyoming, the State Board of Vocational Education is in charge of dividing Perkins funds between secondary and postsecondary institutions. The purpose of this report is to discuss a requirement in the Perkins Actdeveloping a rationale for allocating money between secondary and postsecondary education. When Perkins funding is offered across the country, it is given in two categories: counting enrollment (vocational or non vocational) or some kind of needs assessment. Currently Wyoming allocates 65% to secondary schools and 35% to postsecondary schools and the Wyoming State Board of Vocational Education (WSBVE) must decided if it will leave the split as is (65/35) or modify it. Overall, career-technical education is more expensive to deliver than  traditional academic coursework. Therefore, both secondary and postsecondary institutions struggle with decisions as what they can and cannot afford to offer in the vocational arena. Information is provided on other states' rational for funding, purposes of Perkins Funding, and Wyoming data on vocational full time equivalency. The report concludes with a discussion on the history and purposes of federal vocational funding programs and four major reasons why some favor a greater split for postsecondary education.

The benchmarks are: active and collaborative learning, student effort, academic challenge, student faculty interaction, and support for learners. All address institutional practices and student behaviors that research has shows are important in promoting student learning and retention. Some of the key findings of the report are the following: (1) 64% of students actively participate in class discussions versus 36% who do not; (2) 31% of students have never made a class presentation; (3) 67% of full time students spend ten or fewer hours preparing for class; (4) 49% of students worked harder than they thought they could to meet an instructor's demands; (5) 67% of students claim  that exams are relatively to extremely challenging; and (6) 31% of full time students read four or fewer assigned textbooks or books during the school year. Students were questioned regarding Academic and Support Services and they ranked the following as areas that they are most dissatisfied with: (1) career counseling; (2) job placement assistance; (3) financial aid advising; and (4) transfer credit assistance.

This first report is intended to provide background on Minnesota's alternative-education programs, stimulate discussion, and highlight a number of important policy questions. It is not meant to be formal academic research or an exhaustive description of what alternative-education programs are or could be.  Alternative-education programs are similar to charter schools in that they create space to design new and different learning models. But they enroll more students. This report specifically addresses the following: (1) what alternative-education programs are; (2) who their students are; (3) how their students differ; (4) what the schools do differently with students; (5) why not much is known about them; and (6) what role they play in the current discussion about creating spaces through which new learning models can emerge.

(2) What schoolwide practices are related to student success on the new learning outcomes? (3) What are the characteristics of the schools where students are most successful? (4) To what degree are district central-office practices related to student success? and (5) What role does the district play in school success and student achievement? The first section presents an overview of educational reform in Washington. The next section  focuses on the research findings around classroom instruction. The third section focuses on the research findings about effective schoolwide and district policies and practices. The fourth section reviews what has been learned from research and evaluation efforts in more than 200 schools attempting reform with the assistance of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The final section synthesizes the findings and discusses the implications for further reform efforts in Washington. (Contains 36 references.) (WFA)",

In fact, the academic achievement gaps in many suburban communities are actually greater than those in urban school districts. This research brief looks at the achievement gap in suburban schools, offering preliminary answers to the following questions: (1) How is it possible that some of our best public schools continue to show disappointing results for their students of color? (2) What are the factors that cause, exacerbate, and even sustain the academic achievement gaps in the suburbs? (3) How can educators understand the complexities that confound the simple presentation of scores? and (4) What can schools and communities do to ameliorate and ultimately eliminate these  gaps? The brief concludes that knocking down barriers to high achievement for students of color in the suburbs demands interactive strategies that attend to the whole set of factors that affect achievement. School leaders need to involve students, staff, and the community to develop focused plans and courses of action. Included in the brief is a basic description of the Tripod project, an example of ways of changing classroom practices that may serve to reduce the gap. (WFA)",

Characteristics of quality work-based programs are listed and include clear program goals; clear roles and responsibilities for work site supervisors, mentors, teachers, support personnel, and other partners; training plans that specify learning goals tailored to individual students with specific outcomes connected to student learning; convenient links among students, schools, and employers;  on-the-job learning; range of work-based learning opportunities; mentor(s) at work site; clear expectations and feedback to assess progress toward goals; assessments to identify skills, interests, and support needs; reinforcement of work-based learning outside of work; and appropriate academic, social, and administrative support for students, employers, and all partners. Successful models of work-based learning programs are highlighted, including the \"High School/High Tech\" model and the \"Bridges... from School to Work\" program.

The classroom teachers who designed and implemented the project hypothesized that students who worked with a dancer once a week to learn math concepts would become more engaged in mathematics and have more successful and positive experiences with mathematics than students who did not work with a dancer. Overall there was a significant difference between the dance/math  students' and the non-dance/math students' attitudes toward mathematics. (MM)",

This is particularly problematic for teachers who work in high poverty, diverse school districts precisely because of the unique sociopolitical contexts of schooling in these communities. In this paper, preliminary results of a research study are reported in which 28 secondary-level mathematics teachers who work with diverse students in one of the poorest states in the US identify barriers to employing progressive instructional strategies in their classrooms. Specifically, the teachers describe how the intensification of their workload, the lack of support provided by  administrators, colleagues, and parents and resistance from significance of a sociopolitical perspective to understand barriers to reform particularly for teachers working with high poverty, diverse communities.

        "description":"All have benefited from the industrial revolution which began in the 18th century and saw the gradual replacement of manual labor by machine. In the late 20th century, another revolution has been brought about by the rapid development of increasingly cheap and powerful computer-based technologies. Whereas the industrial revolution occurred through the mechanization of manual labor, the current electronic revolution is being achieved through a mechanization of certain sorts of intellectual skills. The brain rather than the hand is being made redundant. Initially from the mathematical point of view, the sort of intellectual skills that could be mechanized on an everyday basis might be dismissed as being relatively elementary in nature. However, high- level mathematical skills which  used to be solved by complex algebraic expressions are now solved by handheld computer algebra systems. The key then is to see that emerging technologies do appear to threaten to make much of what was taught in the past redundant but they also offer real opportunities to enhance the mathematical capabilities of students.

Her new teaching practices raise serious dilemmas for her in relation to her teaching context, in particular, the limited knowledge of her pupils. Using Vygotsky's notion of mediation in the zone of proximal development, it is argued that her successes, dilemmas and constraints raise important questions for mathematics teacher development programs in such contexts. In particular the position of contextually grounded pedagogical content knowledge is considered. (Author)",

Students in both countries believe mathematics to be rigid and inflexible, and in particular, that it is a subject that leaves no room for negotiation of meaning. However, while the lack of opportunity for understanding mathematics was important, a much more salient factor in determining students' attitudes towards mathematics was that they did not see success at mathematics as in any way relevant to their developing identities, except insofar as success at mathematics allowed access to future education and  careers.

        "description":"The Ninth International Congress on Mathematics Education (ICME-9) held in Makuhari, Japan, in August 2000 provided a unique opportunity for the Mathematical Sciences Education Board and the U.S. National Commission on Mathematics Instruction. Together with educators from the Japanese mathematical community, they hosted a workshop on teacher development immediately following the Congress. The aim of the workshop was to draw upon the expertise of participants from the two countries to work on developing a better understanding of the knowledge that is needed to teach mathematics well and how to help teachers gain this knowledge. The workshop focused on using the study of classroom events to help elementary mathematics teachers improve their teaching. In the first part of the  workshop, participants considered a professional development approach that the Japanese refer to as jugyokenkyu or &quot;lesson study&quot;. In the second part of the workshop, participants considered the use of classroom documentation and written cases, highlighting some of the work performed in the United States. The workshop consisted of large group plenary sessions, panel discussions, activity-based sessions, and small group discussion. Interactions between the two cultures were made possible by simultaneous translation. &quot;Studying Classroom Teaching as a Medium for Professional Development&quot; is a record of what took place at the workshop. The first section consists of papers written after the workshop by two participants reflecting on their experiences during the workshop. The body of the  proceedings consists of edited transcriptions of the talks presented in plenary sessions and of the remarks given by panel members on various topics. The final section of the document contains the summaries of small group discussions describing the group response to one or two focused questions. A 90-minute videotape accompanies the book and includes video selections of classroom lessons and a Japanese post-lesson discussion that were shown at the workshop. These segments--along with written cases describing mathematics classes--were used to engage participants in observing and discussing classroom practices, allowing them to consider how such materials might be used in professional development contexts. Supporting print materials, such as transcripts and lesson plans, are in the  appendixes. (Author)",

Philosophically and theoretically, there is strong support for the integration of science and mathematics education as a way to enrich science and mathematics learning experiences and improve student understanding of and attitude toward these disciplines. This bibliography was prepared for classroom teachers, teacher educators, curriculum reformers and developers, and educational researchers interested in the exploration of the topic of integrated science and mathematics teaching and learning. The first volume  of the bibliography contained 555 citations published between 1905 and the first half of 1991 related to the integration of science and mathematics teaching and learning. This volume is an updated bibliography of publications from the second half of 1991 through 2001 and includes documents that were inadvertently omitted in the first volume. The major purposes of both volumes are to: (1) provide resources for classroom practice, policy decisions, and research; (2) facilitate the development of new curriculum and instructional materials; (3) stimulate additional research; (4) identify K-12 and teacher preparation and enhancement models; and (5) present a century-long portrayal of trends and issues.

It concludes with recommendations for developing evidence-based educational strategies and creating the organizational requirements necessary for implementing these strategies. The first section of this paper focuses on &quot;Societal Efforts to Improve Educational Outcomes for Underrepresented Groups&quot; (laying the foundations in the 1960s, factors that make closing of achievement and attainment gaps more challenging, and efforts to improve educational outcomes from the late 1960s to the present). The second section  presents &quot;Overview of the Academic Achievement Gaps (research suggests that there continue to be large achievement gaps to close in preK-16 education). The third section discusses &quot;Promoting More Rapid Progress Over the Long Term,&quot; offering recommendations in two categories (tasks concerned with developing more evidence-based strategies and organizational requirements for pursuing these tasks). The final section discusses the amount of time that will be required to address and remedy the achievement gap It notes that efforts to address the high achievement issue and the within-class issue are not likely to emerge over the next 5-10 years as significant priorities for PreK-16 education because the low achievement of disadvantaged students remains a very pressing matter which will command  an enormous amount of attention for a long time, and because few leading academic researchers, school reformers, and policymakers have shown much interest in the high achievement and within-class issues.

        "description":"This paper asserts that while many factors contribute to the poor quality of education in New York City public schools, one of the primary obstacles to guaranteeing the right to education is a widespread lack of accountability by school officials. This lack of participation is tied to the school system's failure to ensure effective participation by parents and communities. The paper draws from a series of interviews with parents, community organizers, and education advocates to identify and critique obstacles to participation that exist in the current school system. In addressing the the role of civil society, the paper relies on international standards on civil, political, and human rights, including the United Nations' World Declaration on Education for All. Section 1, &quot;New  York City Fails to Ensure the Human Right to Education,&quot; describes the situation. Section 2, &quot;Civil Society and the Right to Participation,&quot; discusses the importance of civil society participation in revitalizing urban public schools. Section 3, &quot;Ensuring Parent and Community Participation in NYC Schools,&quot; discusses structures for participation (effectiveness, power, and equitable representation; creating accessible and welcoming environments for participation; transparency and adequate access to information; and building the capacity of parents and communities for informed and effective participation). Part 4, &quot;Building Human Rights Structures: The Role of an Ombudsperson for the Right to Education,&quot; describes the responsibilities of the office of a human rights ombudsperson. An appendix  presents articles on the right to educationfound in principal human rights conventions and declarations; excerpts from declarations, general comments and other documents expanding on the right to education; and excerpts from covenants and general comments on the right to participation.

It discusses: subjects on which students will be tested and when (all states must test math and reading achievement annually in grades 3-8 and at least once during grades 10-12 by 2005-06); whether children with disabilities or limited English proficiency will be tested (NCLB requires testing of all students, and states must provide reasonable accommodation for students with special needs); and how schools will be graded (each district must produce and distribute annual report cards with information on how students performed on state tests in the entire district and each school). Report cards must be made available to parents by the beginning of each school year, though  states and districts may publicize the information through other channels. The guide defines adequate yearly progress (a requirement of NCLB that states set minimum levels of student improvement that districts and schools must make within a certain period) and indicates that school report cards must indicate if schools are meeting state standards of adequate yearly progress or are needing improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. The guide explains that local districts are also held accountable for improving teacher quality (each state receiving Title II funds must have a plan guaranteeing that all teachers of core academic subjects are highly qualified by 2005-06).

        "description":"The voucher intervention sponsored by New York City's School Choice Scholarships Foundation (SCSF) has been a valuable source of information about such programs. It began in 1997, when K-4 public school students were invited to apply to SCSF for a voucher to help defray costs of private school tuition. Over 1,200 of 20,000 applicants were offered vouchers via a lottery. Since vouchers were awarded by lot, the SCSF program was evaluated as a randomized field trial. Researchers collected baseline test scores and other data prior to the lottery, administered the lottery, then collected followup data 1, 2, and 3 years later. A group families who did not win the lottery acted as the controls. For non-African Americans, and for students as a whole, private schools did not have any  discernable impact on test scores. For African Americans, substantial improvements were observed in all 3 years. Although some researchers express strong doubts that African American benefitted much from the New York City voucher intervention, this study suggests that evidence supports the original contention that African Americans, and only African Americans, posted significant and positive test score gains associated with attending a private school that in year 3 ranged from one-quarter to two-fifths of a standard deviation, depending on the model estimated.

        "description":"MDRC's Opening Doors to Earning Credentials Project and its early reports found that community colleges are the local educational institutions with the greatest potential for helping low-wage workers earn skills and credentials that lead to educational and career advancement. Opening Doors also identified serious obstacles to realizing that potential (e.g., characteristics of the low-wage workforce, institutional structure and priorities of most community colleges, and external policy environments in which they operate). MDRC asked Jobs for the Future to look at curricular and program redesign strategies being used in community colleges today to speed advancement from lower levels of skill into credential programs and to shorten the time commitment for earning a credential. This  paper presents a framework for understanding the range of experimentation with program and class reformatting and design, identifying programs that exemplify promising approaches. The framework focuses on: developmental education approaches that can help improve college credential outcomes (innovative approaches to redesigning developmental education programs and lessons from innovative college programs); curricular and program redesign of college credential programs (innovative college program models); and programs for young high school dropouts or graduates who are still not college-ready.

        "description":"This paper examines correlations between children's educational outcomes and family structure. Although popular discussions focus on distinctions between two-parent and single-parent families, earlier research shows that outcomes for stepchildren are similar to outcomes for children in single-parent families, and earlier researchers suggested that the crucial distinction is between children who were reared by both biological parents and children who were not. This paper suggests that such a finding is misleading, asserting that educational outcomes for both types of children in blended families--stepchildren and their half-siblings who are the joint biological children of both parents--are similar to each other and substantially worse than outcomes for children reared in  traditional nuclear families. It concludes that the crucial distinction is between children reared in traditional nuclear families and children reared in other family structures. The paper also examines the effect of family structure on children's outcomes, recommending a reformulation of the family structure question by specifying some explicit counterfactual and expressing a preference for a policy-relevant counterfactual. The paper suggests considering the effect of reducing the marriage penalty in the earned income tax credit that makes the credit essentially unavailable to two-earner couples.

Analysis of data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988, a nationally representative survey of 8th grade students in the United States, indicates that the presence of an 8th grade promotion test requirement is strongly associated with an increased probability of dropping out. This association persists even after controlling for a moderate range of school and individual level characteristics associated with dropping out. The difference in dropout rates between students taking and not taking promotion tests is not trivial, particularly for students with low achievement, low grade point average, and low socioeconomic status, where the difference in dropout  probabilities is as much as two percentage points.

This digest explores the implementation of Title I from its beginnings as the first and largest attempt to provide federal money for education to its current place in the whole school reform effort. Although anti-poverty remains Title I's primary goal, its dominant policy objectives have broadened from fiscal accountability to improving the quality of instruction and achievement in Title I schools. The latest phase of development of Title I has been shaped by competing visions of how to raise student performance, including  whole school reform, district-based support, and voucher programs. After describing fragmentation versus schoolwide reform, the report presents an example of schoolwide Title I implementation in Minneapolis. It also describes Title I and the Improving America's Schools Act and examines competing approaches to raising student performance in Title I schools (adopting externally designed models that have been proven effective; shaping Title I schools with district wide support and sanctions to raise academic standards, improve professional development, and make adequate yearly progress; and using educational vouchers).

        "description":"Although the United States has always been a linguistically diverse country, during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the issue of educating students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) has gained heightened attention and importance due to increasing demographic, judicial, political, and educational concerns. Many non-foreign language teachers who are facing the prospect of educating LEP students feel apprehensive due to their lack of preparation and training in the area. This paper examines these issues, focusing on: legal and legislative precedence for educating LEP students; challenges in working with LEP students; considerations for teachers of LEP students; and using total physical response and the natural approach in teaching LEP students. The paper concludes that  the world of the 21st century will continue to change the notion of the United States as a homogeneous, monolingual culture, and if schools are a reflection of society, then delivering quality instruction in increasingly diverse classrooms is a reality with which teachers must come to terms.

        "description":"Current recommendations for achieving high quality professional development for teachers include the creation of a professional learning community wherein each member of the educational community--student, teacher, parent, community, principal, and staff--is both teacher and learner. Key to the success of this approach, however, is the role of the peer mentor or coach. This study was designed to determine what it takes to be a successful professional development coach by gathering data based on the perspectives and experiences of 31 peer coaches. Results suggest that, while content expertise is important, coaches must possess strong interpersonal skills in order to build trusting relationships with teachers. These relationships, then, enable coaches to use their content expertise  to facilitate changes in teachers' practice. Suggestions for selecting and training peer coaches are included.

        "description":"School districts use a variety of professional development initiatives, many of them successfully. However, many teachers either endure the initiatives and return to their old ways after the initiatives are over, or they close their doors and ignore them altogether. Consequently, sustaining or growing the results of these initiatives is challenging. This study examines one Midwestern metropolitan school district's coaching initiative through the eyes of four coaches who described the perceived success of the initiative, their roles as coaches and their perceptions of what was needed to sustain that success after returning to their classrooms. Data were gathered via an online survey, documents provided by the district administration, and individual interviews with the coaches.  Results indicated that coaches felt there was a need for continued support from various networked resources following the initiative in order to sustain or grow the results. (Contains 26 references.)

Project goals were to enhance inservice teachers' ability with technology and to prepare preservice teachers for the use of technology in the classroom. Workshops were held during two semesters. Evaluation involved questionnaires administered anonymously to participants following the workshops. Results for the first semester preservice teachers indicated that they tended to agree to statements affirming their ability to apply what was learned for classroom instruction through the workshops. Results were similar for the second semester preservice teachers for all items except those regarding their ability to help students with  databases and spreadsheets. These overall affirmative answers were supported by the answers of cooperating teachers. Inservice teachers tended to view themselves as more capable of helping others with technology than did preservice teachers. Many preservice teachers made positive comments about having inservice teachers conduct the workshops. (Contains 16 references.) (SM)",

Less attention, however, is given to professional knowledge of teacher educators, the focus of this paper. The paper examines the issue by discussing some of the literature on the subject and by asking novice teachers and teacher educators about the characteristics of good teacher educators, the professional knowledge of teacher educators, and the difference between the professional knowledge of teacher educators and teachers. Furthermore, experienced teacher educators were asked to choose artifacts as evidence to be included in a presentation portfolio of their professional competence. Findings indicate that even though there is much  overlapping in the professional knowledge of the two groups of professionals, there are also distinct differences of importance to the current discussion on education for and standards of teacher educators.

Moreover, educational equity is a precondition for excellence. The failure to achieve universally effective education in U.S. society is known to be a correlate of failure to achieve social justice. By almost any measure, there continues to be serious differences between the level and quality of educational achievement for children coming from rich or poor families and from ethnic majority or some ethnic minority group families. It is important to achieve equal educational results for all children. Failure to do so will hamper specific groups from obtaining the fundamental,  primary goods and services distributed by society--rights, liberties, self-respect, power, opportunities, income, and wealth. Education is a social institution, controlling access to important opportunities and resources. State and national accountability policy can leverage social justice. (Contains 32 references.)

The online course was delivered using a third-party course management tool. The structure of the course and the use of computer-mediated communication tools to promote interaction were somewhat controlled by the course management tool's pedagogical assumptions of design and the resulting technological and structural capabilities. Data were collected via conversations with a student, surveys that examined students' beliefs about their group processes, and a focus group interview. Results indicated that time was a major factor in determining how one  group structured their use of the available technology tools. The course tool limited some of the design decisions about interaction. However, based on the interactions within the three groups, the personalities and experiences of individual members also played a role in their interaction. The need and ability to trust was a common theme among respondents. For at least two of the groups, students' level of technological experience factored in at the beginning of the group project.

A sample of 1,598 Taiwanese elementary school children in grades 3-6 were administered a school self-concept scale and a measure of their perceptions of teachers' positive and negative oral feedback in academic and nonacademic domains. Homeroom teachers were asked to identify students for whom they had high or low expectations. Although amounts of all four types of perceived feedback differed significantly across expectancy groups, discriminant analysis indicated that student perceptions of positive and negative academic oral feedback were more heavily weighted in predicting teacher expectancy level. Furthermore, structural equation modeling showed that both  positive and negative academic oral feedback were predictive of the three dimensions of school self-concept. The strongest relationship was between positive academic oral feedback and academic self-concept. Two-way ANOVAs evaluating grade and gender effects for oral feedback showed that males perceived more negative oral feedback from teachers than females in all four grades, although there were no significant gender differences on positive academic and nonacademic oral feedback. Regarding the effect of grade on perceived feedback, fourth grade students always perceived more positive and less negative oral feedback than fifth graders. Females' perceptions of negative feedback followed this trend, but differences were not significant across grade. Some suggestions for practitioners are  noted. (Contains 22 references.)

This art activity was conducted a second time subsequent to the literature and discussion sessions to examine signs of growths. Data came from student interviews, observations, field notes, student writings and art products, and audiotaped literature discussions. Results indicated that all four students' attitudes and perceptions of  gender roles and expectations were positively influenced through the reading and discussing of children's literature with characters in gender equitable roles. Students acknowledged the importance of gender equity and recognized the limitations gender stereotyping can exert on people's ambitions, interests, and behaviors. They looked within themselves for answers to the problems plaguing the characters, people within their environments, and themselves. (Contains 61 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"Due to increased emphasis on student success and increasing recognition of the school principal's role in creating/maintaining a culture of success, preparation programs in school administration are undergoing increased scrutiny. This prompted the creation of a set of standards for school leaders by the Council of Chief State School Officers and a guide to articulate those standards by the National Policy Board for Educational Administration. The emphasis of the standards is on the cognitive domain. At the State University of New York at Cortland, students are eligible to do an internship after seven or eight three-credit classes. Interns must submit letters of commitment from various administrators accepting the role of mentor and the responsibility for providing and/or opening  the door to a wide variety of administrative experiences. Upon acceptance, a university supervisor is appointed. Most students dedicate themselves to the internship full-time. Researchers assessed what the internship taught and the needs that classroom preparation did not fulfill. Respondents focused on such areas as their learning to go with the flow, becoming a historian and anthropologist of the culture, developing an understanding of the school's purpose and value, dealing with the staggering demands of the job, and enjoying the rush of everything coming together.

        "description":"In educational settings, decentralized budgeting refers to various fiscal practices that disperse budgeting responsibility away from central administration to the line education units. This distributed decision-making is common to several financial management models. Among the many financial management models that employ decentralized budgeting are site-based budgeting, contribution margin budgeting, and responsibility center management or responsibility center budgeting. While all of these models incorporate distributed decision making into their operation, the span of budgetary decision making responsibility appears to be related to the educational unit's influence over its revenue stream. All three models share characteristics common to both public school and postsecondary  educational settings. From the perspectives of budgeting practitioners, the diversity of decentralized budgeting in educational settings is apparent. From public school settings, where administrators focus their budgeting energies on controlling costs, to universities, where administrators pursue alternative revenue sources, decentralized budgeting manifests the characteristics of different financial management models. Across the range of diverse manifestations, decentralized budgeting in education attempts to empower fundamental unit personnel with the ability to participate in, influence, and take ownership of expense and/or revenue decisions for which they are ultimately and uniquely responsible.

The secondary education program area infused SBL into secondary majors' Planning and Managing Learning class and Methods of Teaching classes. SBL offered authentic ways for teacher educators to simulate cases in which teacher candidates could work toward professionalism. PBL and SBL helped faculty and students practice, in real ways, creating authentic learning spaces using authentic learning techniques, and it offered faculty ways to move away from teacher-centered learning. This paper discusses: SBL and self-directed learning; planning and resourcing a Positive Learning Places Plan unit; conducting the unit using SBL;  and assessing the unit. Data from student surveys indicated that students were positive about SBL and its learning components. However, they felt lost, confused, unclear, and frustrated for the first part of the work, and then gradually caught on. The teacher's feelings of efficacy were mixed. The paper concludes that SBL and all it requires is a viable endeavor for secondary education, suggesting that as teacher candidates become aware of the expectation for them to direct their own learning, they may more readily embrace the creativity in the techniques and adopt SBL for their own classrooms.

Teachers from the two schools completed interviews. Researchers also reviewed students' achievement test scores and examined teachers' lesson plans. Using the textbooks and lesson plans, researchers examined the complexity of skills covered throughout the year. Results indicated that although all teachers showed progress through the textbook, overall, the year round school teachers progressed more quickly  than did the traditional school teachers, especially near the beginning of the school year. Teachers' perceptions were related to the pacing of instruction. All teachers reported a preference for the type of calendar under which they were currently working. The year round teachers believed that they and their students experienced less burnout than they would have under a traditional calendar as a result of more frequent breaks from the school allowed by the year round school calendar.

The Attitudes Toward Mathematics Instrument (ATMI) was administered to students enrolled in introductory mathematics classes (Pre-Calculus, Calculus, and Business Calculus) at two Southeast universities, one a large state university and the other one a small private liberal arts college. The subjects of the study were 275 college students; 141 attended the state university and 134 attended the liberal arts college. General linear analysis revealed no significant differences between students from the state university and students from the liberal arts college in any of four factors (self-confidence, value of mathematics, enjoyment of mathematics, and motivation). Also, there were no  significant differences between males and females on each of the four factors. These results suggest that gender differences in mathematics were not reflected in this sample.

        "description":"This study provides an overview of class size research, examples of various class size and pupil-teacher-ratio (PTR) configurations commonly used by practitioners, and the most recent findings of scientifically controlled experimental Tennessee STAR studies. The learning environment is hierarchical in nature, with student-level data influenced by family characteristics external to school; school-level data influenced by school faculty, staff, and resources; and district-level data influenced by the schools and the community of which they are a part. This paper examines the results of two- and three-level class size models that have been able to account for more variability than one-level models and that thus have provided the most comprehensive interpretations available of the  effects of small classes. Results have indicated that smaller classes have been effective with diverse populations of students but most effective in the earlier grades (K-3) with minorities or students living in poverty. The paper concludes that both PTR and class size provide important information for decision makers, that funding sources affect class size decisions, and that the class size configuration may often be determined by scheduling considerations and by availability of faculty and facilities.

        "description":"Most research on transformational leadership has used the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) developed by Bass and his associates. This paper examines the extent to which the MLQ measures the dimensions that it purports to measure in school organization, also assessing the relevance of idealized influence (charisma) in stable school organizations. Previous research has suggested that charismatic leadership would be more likely found in a new and struggling organization. The paper discusses empirical results from previous studies that have used the MLQ. It also presents the results from three studies that examined the conceptual adequacy and psychometric qualities of the MLQ. In Study 1 (Wooderson-Perzan, 2000), a content adequacy assessment of the transformational  leadership items was conducted. In Study 2 (Wooderson-Perzan and Lunenburg, 2001) and in Study 3 (Blair and Lunenburg, 2002), a series of confirmatory factor analyses, internal consistency estimates, and correlations were conducted on a revised set of transformational leadership items. The paper concludes that, despite the MLQ's shortcomings, it does identify several leader behaviors that appear to be components of transformational leadership. It finds empirical support for three behaviorally oriented dimensions of transformational leadership that are consistent with theoretical propositions (intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, and inspirational motivation).

It focused on whether there were differences in frequency of school participation and in levels of engagement in home learning activities between parents who had and had not participated in the PAT program. Participants were 40 parents who had been part of a PAT program for at least 10 months and 40 non-PAT parents who acted as controls. Both groups had children enrolled in public or private pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classes for 2002-03. A parent questionnaire was developed to collect data on parents' involvement in school activities and learning activities within the home. Most of the  respondents' children lived in homes where there was one parent. Half of the parents had completed high school or obtained a GED certificate. About half of the children had been in Head Start for 2 years. Overall, the results found significant differences between the two groups on the frequency with which they engaged in school involvement activities and home learning activities, with PAT participants much more involved.

The Juvenile Emotion Management Scale was administered to male middle school students to assess their emotion management ability in responding to emotional arousal. Students' emotion management scores that fall below 70 percent (104 and below) of the maximum score (150) are considered at risk for managing socially appropriate emotions. Data analysis indicated that 48 percent of the sample scored at 104 and below, indicating deficiencies in their ability to manage emotional reactions to stressors or problems found in various social contexts. The areas of deficiency for these students were in their ability  to alter their emotional response to provocative situations and to manage feelings concerning what is or is not appropriate to a given situation.

This paper summarizes an extensive review of the literature pertaining to the many issues that surround this problem. The review revealed a wide range of viewpoints and a broad spectrum of research methodologies used to analyze the multiple factors associated with the under-representation of women in PSTEM career fields. It used four frameworks to examine the issue: social psychological framework: internal conflict models; environmental and economic framework: external conflict models; comprehensive framework: integrated models; and critical feminist framework: alternate assumptions models. Overall, regarding internal conflicts, confidence  issues were found to be a barrier, and goal-orientation an asset. Regarding external conflicts, negative environments were offset by positive social support networks. Regarding integrated models, good preparation and good advising were necessary, but not sufficient, to sustain commitment. Regarding the feminist perspective, women avoid intervention strategies that label them as defective or try to fit them to the mold or a male-dominated paradigm. (Contains 83 references.) (SM)",

A teacher's first moral obligation is to provide excellent instruction. Teachers with high levels of moral professionalism have a deep obligation to help students learn and to demonstrate their moral professionalism. Teachers' professional ethical dispositions must now be addressed as part of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) accreditation process. Four components of ethical education include: moral sensitivity, moral judgment, moral motivation, and moral character. Each  component is clearly defined, and educational goals, teaching strategies and assessment methods can be derived from those definitions. Professionals in education need objective knowledge about how children form a basic sense of right and wrong and how schools can reinforce appropriate development. An appropriate classroom environment can enhance students' positive dispositions if teachers receive proper training. The digest highlights three teacher education programs offering students the knowledge and professional skills to integrate character education into classroom practices. It concludes that moral and ethical issues, including character education, are slowly becoming part of teacher education programs, with deans and administrators of teacher education programs agreeing that core  values can and should be taught in schools.

        "description":"Homework is a leading factor for improving academic performance among students who have the ability to work independently and adequate parental support to complete homework assignments. When parents are interested in children's homework, students are more likely to successfully complete their assignments. Teacher support is also necessary to significantly improve student achievement. Parent and teacher training is important in this process. Without training, some parents may be inadequately prepared to effectively equip children with skills to improve their overall academic outcomes. To improve parent involvement, teachers must be trained to design interactive homework (IH) assignments. When designing homework, teachers should consider elements that will facilitate: parent-child  interactions, parent-child interest, students' reasoning, and students' self-management/self-directness. Teachers should also ensure that homework is suitable for diverse students and families. Because it is important for teachers to consider parents' and children's interests when designing interactive homework assignments, they should receive recommendations for gathering data regarding family backgrounds and interests using an Interest Inventory Checklist. Teachers must learn how to develop strategies to help students learn new vocabulary across the curriculum and how to formulate developmentally appropriate inference questions or word problems across the curriculum. Finally, training can help teachers learn to provide effective verbal and written directions for completing homework for  parents and children. (Contains 24 references.) (SM)",

One child out of four has an emotional, social, or physical health limitation that interferes with learning. Because schools have the capacity to reach 53 million students every year for 12 years, they are in a unique position to influence young people's physical, mental, and social well-being. Recent reports identify CSHE as a necessary component of a national infrastructure to support children's health. The capacity of CSHE to prevent or eliminate health problems among young people depends on the effectiveness of their teachers. This digest reviews the essential elements of preservice preparation of school-based health educators,  focusing on the need for effective, standards-based health education teacher preparation. It describes seven professional standards for the preparation of health education teachers, and it cites research showing that effective curricula implemented by well-prepared teachers can reduce risky behaviors among youth. It concludes that teachers trained according to national standards can have a positive impact on children's health knowledge, skills, and behaviors by effectively delivering CSHE.

Specifically, the study addresses the use of performance-based indicators in community colleges. The data was gathered by calling individual community colleges or the educational governing board of each state. The study concludes that there has been an increase in the number of indicators, which are currently in use. A shift has occurred in how indicators are defined. Specifically, current indicators are more narrowly defined that those previously used. Although not all states have performance based funding as a policy, community colleges do use the indicators to gain additional  funds from the state government. Furthermore, some community colleges use indicators to increase tuition. The large number of states that have changed their policy regarding indicators can be viewed as an indication of future changes in regards to how community colleges are funded. Furthermore, it is logical to assume that with the current national and state budget constraints further pressure will be added onto state education boards to make colleges responsible for outcomes.

The study found definite preferences among faculty who teach traditional and web-related courses and that teaching in a web-based environment has an affect on their instructional goals. The study concludes that the findings in the report are significant and that they can lead to  considerable improvements in overall teaching effectiveness. Further studies need to be completed on this topic because solely based upon the findings in this study, it is difficult to ascertain whether the effects on the teaching goal among the groups of faculty were influenced by the technology of the web-base setting or by the fact that faculty needed to readjust their teaching styles to accommodate a change in the learning environment.

The biggest gap in research is about community college instructors who teach the most and least prepared students through honors and developmental courses. Data was gathered from a national survey the professional practices and attitudes of community college faculty. Out of 1,993 surveys, 1,531 were returned for a response rate of 76.8%. The results showed that 8.6% had taught at least one honors course within the two years before they completed the survey and that 26.4% had taught at least one developmental course within the same time frame. The authors used logistic regressions to better understand the relationship between variables considered. The results indicate  that professors that teach honors courses are characterized by an attachment to the four year university model of instruction and research and engages in traditional scholarly/research activities. Developmental instructors are characterized by an attachment to secondary school teachers, ideas, and methods, rely upon their colleagues in high schools for advice, and often have prior experience teaching in a high school.

        "description":"This essay reports the results of the latest Transfer Assembly Project examining the transfer behavior of students entering community colleges in 1995 and moving on to public in-state senior institutions by 1999. The essay also addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the Centers transfer rate definition and the reasons underlying differences in transfer rates. Since this study took twelve years to complete, the study's methodologies and findings are presented in a historical and comparative perspective. The study found that the national rate of transfer was 25.2% which indicates that the transfer function of American community colleges in intact. Community colleges provide an important avenue of educational progress for a large portion of the population. It should be noted that  the lowest transfer rate was 15.3% for black students followed by 16.9% for Hispanic students. The study concludes that the increase in transfer rate reported from the 1999 and 2001 Transfer Assemblies might be the first signs of such a trend. Furthermore, future administrations of the survey using the same definition will be able to further document changes in the community college transfer function. (Contains 18 references and 3 tables.)

        "description":"Researchers in goal orientation studies have successfully demonstrated the distinct effects of two separate single learning goals, mastery and performance goal. To advance the understanding of learning goals, a new research direction should be geared towards exploring the notion of multiple goals. Recent work in the field has also called for the study of multiple goals. However, it is not clear how multiple goals should be conceptualized. Should multiple goals be understood as students having three to four separate learning goals? Alternatively, should these goals be conceptualized as related or connected in some manner? This paper advances the latter position and theorizes goals as connected in a systematic network. Qualitative data gathered from in- depth interviews were  employed to corroborate this network perspective of multiple goals. In general, high achieving students tended to have a more complicated goal network than low achieving students, which provided them with a strong motivation to master the knowledge and to perform well.

The data includes students enrolled in one or more online classes between July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2001. The majority (80%) of these students enrolled in a mixture of online and on campus classes. The study compares \"online students\" with \"campus students.\" The data indicates  the flexibility is a major reason for growth in online learning. Online learning particularly appeals to women, especially those with children. Although many students have expressed satisfaction with the format, content of courses, the instruction, and service provided by online courses, there have been low completion scores exhibited by online students.

During this time span, credit language course activity has grown from 28,391 credits in 1980 to 76,608 credits in 2001. This is an increase of 48,217 credits in second language courses. Total credits grew by 90,956 during this same period, which means that second language courses provided 53% of the M-DCC's credit growth. Furthermore, second language non-credit equivalents grew from 29.5% of all credit equivalents to 54% of all equivalents in 2001. Dramatic increases occurred in Fall term 2000 and again in Fall term 2001. Second language equivalents grew by 52,237 while total non-credit equivalents grew by 83,831 during this time frame. The  document contains detailed data regarding second language credit and second language non-credit numbers for the following years: 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2001. Contains three tables, which discuss trends in English as a second language for the following campuses: North Campus, Kendall Campus, Wolfson Campus, InterAmerican Campus, and Hialeah Center. Proportional credit second language activity was by far the greatest at the Hialeah Center. (MZ)",

        "description":"This document examines the concepts of validity, reliability, and appropriateness from a language testing perspective as they apply to the following four assessment issues raised by the National Reporting System (NRS): (1) What type of language assessment seems to be required by the NRS: proficiency or achievement?; (2) Knowing that the NRS focuses on what the learner can do in the real world, and knowing the challenges to classroom teaching, what type of assessment would be most appropriate for the NRS?; (3) Knowing that all these variables need to be attended to, what does validity entail for appropriate NRS assessment?; and (4) What does reliability mean for performance measures meeting the rigorous requirements of the NRS? The document concludes that ensuring that language  tests for adult English language learners are appropriate, valid, and reliable is challenging. Performance based assessments are inherently complex to develop and implement. Yet, because the focus of assessment--both in the NRS descriptors and in the Department of Education's definition of content standards--is on what learners can do with the language, performance assessments are worth developing and validating.

Title III of NCLB describes specific requirements that states and districts must meet in educating ELLs. In February 2003, the U.S. Department of Education released non-regulatory guidance on the Title III state formula grant program, stating that &quot;The major goals of Title III are to help ensure that limited English proficient children attain English proficiency, develop high levels of academic competence in English, and meet the same challenging state academic content and student achievement standards&quot; as all other students. States are required to develop English language proficiency standards and implement English proficiency tests. They must also develop annual  achievement objectives for increasing the English language proficiency of ELLs and assessing their progress in speaking, reading, writing, listening, and comprehension. State language proficiency standards must be linked to state academic standards. States are in the process of developing new English language proficiency assessments for ELLs. Rural schools may face specific challenges when working to meet the needs of ELLs (e.g., having to develop ESL programs from scratch). The NCLB grants states flexibility in designing programs that are most appropriate for their needs, although appropriately serving ELLs and meeting legislative requirements may entail creative solutions by states, schools, and districts.

Rod McCormick and Norm Admundson to address the need for more culturally sensitive career planning with First Nations people. The most unique thing about this model is the inclusion of many cultural practices, such as: opening and closing prayers, the invitation to smudge, use an eagle feather or a traditional talking stick, as well as sharing the process with family and friends. The model is based upon traditional cultural beliefs and values that honor connectedness, harmony, balance, gifts, roles and responsibilities, and the importance of family and community. It is a holistic career and life planning tool for First Nations youth, their families and communities. It is an interactive and  culturally respectful model that is a welcomed addition to the repertoire of any practitioner. (Author)",

As the work force ages, there are greater numbers of workers dealing with disabilities and serious health problems. Sadly, individuals with disabilities often approach the job search process with misconceptions, misinformation, limited expectations, and fear of failure. Counselors must give these applicants the skills and confidence they need to be marketable candidates that employers will want to hire. This paper provides insight into the problem and offers techniques for helping clients increase their self-confidence, improve their job search skills, and prepare for job interviews. The author addresses the emotional barriers that many disabled job  seekers place in their own path and gives practical advice on how to remove these road blocks. This information can be used with the most-needy clients to help them attain appropriate and satisfying employment. (Author)",

Children who have experienced sexual abuse are often hesitant to respond to direct questioning about this experience. Researchers have studied the H-T-P to determine if these children produce discrete indicators of the abuse, however the test's validity and reliability have not been proven. Despite this lack of psychometric support, the test can be very valuable in providing general information about the child's personality and more importantly strengthen the professional relationship between child and counselor.

Participants in this study were 138 mothers and 120 fathers given the Beliefs About the Consequences of Maternal Employment for Children Scale (BACMEC), which assesses views about maternal employment. Among the fathers surveyed, significant differences emerged in both the Cost and Benefits summary scales. Fathers from two-paycheck families perceived greater benefits associated with maternal employment than did fathers from single paycheck families. Fathers from two-paycheck families perceived fewer costs associated with maternal employment than did fathers from single paycheck families. Mothers' responses yielded a significant group  difference on the benefits summary scale. Mothers from two-paycheck families perceived greater benefits associated with maternal employment than did mothers from single paycheck families. The results of the analysis indicate that participants' attitudes about maternal employment are generally congruent with their chosen lifestyles. In addition, on many of the BACMEC items, the responses from men whose wives did not work reflected the most negative attitudes about maternal employment. (Contains 49 references.) (Author)",

Could both mnemonic and semantic field keyword approaches help these learners by building upon their well-known strengths of rote memorization, especially of visual images necessary for mastery in reading Kanji-based languages? These questions are examined in this study, which compares methods of teaching a Kanji-based language like Japanese to non-natives, with more effective methods for teaching students from Kanji-based countries how to develop better EFL vocabulary and reading skills. Because this is written from a  Japanese perspective, the term &quot;Kanji&quot; is used in a generic sense to mean Chinese characters. When not capitalized, &quot;kanji&quot; will refer to Japanese specific use of these characters. (Contains 57 references.) (Author/SM)",

It places adult English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) in the broader context of the U.S. education system (K-12 and adult education), then describes trends and issues in the areas of program design and instructional practice, assessment, teacher training and professional development, integration of research and practice, and technology. The book concludes that population trends and projections for the next 10 years suggest that the number of adult English language learners in the United States will continue to grow. The effective provision of services to these adults is a primary  challenge to expanding and improving the U.S. adult education system. Adequate resources, as well as creative and alternative strategies, partnerships, and collaborative efforts, are needed to address the areas of assessment, teacher training and professional development, integration of research and practice, and technology.

This study investigated the extent to which adults with limited literacy and/or English language skills were being served at One Stop Career Centers in New Mexico. Data were collected from March-November of 2002 from One Stop customers, One Stop directors and staff, Adult Basic Education (ABE) and Literacy program directors, and employers via individual and focus group interviews. Results indicated that the population of need rarely gained access to job training services, was unlikely to get a formal referral to ABE and Literacy programs at the core level of service at the One Stop Centers, and was not  guaranteed access to information about intensive and job training services either in their communities at large or within the One Stops (most received limited or no information about these services). Recommendations include show leadership on WIA in New Mexico by ensuring universal access to all WIA services by the population of need; create significant WIA policy changes; and improve services at One Stops in several priority areas.

        "description":"This report gives a historical overview of the Los Angeles Community Colleges District Student Survey and provides details about the current survey results. The student survey was started in fall 1976 in order to provide a picture of students by identifying their goals, levels of college preparation, extra curricular interests, transportation patterns, employment workloads, and income levels. Although the survey has changed in throughout the years, its main goal is still to provide a clearer picture of the characteristics of college students. The survey strives to provide the most relevant information at the lowest possible cost and is administered in a class to randomly selected groups in the class. The goal is a minimum 100 classes per small college and 175 for larger  universities. The student survey asks questions about the following eleven categories: (1) educational goals and plans; (2) student background; (3) financial resources; (4) college attendance; (5) college services; (6) educational programs; (7) campus involvement; (8) gains in skill and knowledge; (9) instructional support; (10) campus facilities and service; and (11) computer use. The results are presented in a table format, which shows the results of each college in comparison to the district average. Contains numerous tables. (MZ)",

It looks specifically at access, student assessment, overall student academic success, freshman success, performance in sequence courses, persistence, and rates for degrees, certificates, and transfer. ARC has experienced a 35.9% increase in unduplicated student count from 5 years ago, from 21,205 to 27,784. Summer enrollments during that period have increased from 6,909 to 10,534. The current issue is how to accommodate further increases. In addition, ARC student success rates have increased 1.5% from 5 years ago. The lowest success rates, however, are in English and math. The report correlates success with gender, ethnicity, and age of student. Being female, Asian, and older,  correlate with higher success rates. So does being an ESL student and being affiliated with a student service. The freshman success rate for individual courses ranges from 38% to 87%. As a result, the report suggests that some courses should be deferred until the student is more accustomed to academic rigor. Associate degrees are up 17%, while certificates are up by 163%. Transfer ready and actual transfer rates have also increased. (Contains 67 figures.) (NB)",

Each year, CCRI surveys the previous year's graduates as a way of measuring success. About 1,379 members of the class of 2001 were asked to provide information about place of employment, job title, salary, and status of continuing education. Also, 1,126 (81.7%) responded to the survey. The report indicates 517, or 45.9%, of graduates were employed full-time; 126 (11.2%) were employed full-time and going to school part-time; 106 (9.4%) were employed part-time, 20 (1.8%) were unavailable for employment; 55 (4.9%) were unemployed and searching; 112 (9.9%) were in  school full-time; and 190 (16.9%) were in school full-time and working part-time. More than 93% of respondents were employed, continuing their education, or both.

An exact definition is given for each of preceding indicators in the report as it is used in the document. These Perkins performance measure definitions were finalized with the Virginia and federal departments of  education in the fall 2000. The report finds that for the 2001-02 cycle, the VCCS exceeded performance targets for 4 of the 7 broadly defined measure. There were increases for nontraditional students in nontraditional programs. The report displays the federally approved VCCS or system-level targets for the 2001-02 reporting cycle as well as college performance data for college and Workforce Development Services staff planning and evaluation activities.

        "description":"This paper examines the ways in which the State of Texas economy benefits from the presence of Austin Community College (ACC). ACC pays $70.9 million in direct faculty and staff wages and salaries. The college pays wages and salaries, which generate additional incomes as they are spent, and their operating and capital expenditures generate still further earnings. Altogether, these earnings account for $99.6 million annually in the ACC District economy--equal to that of 2,517 jobs. State and local government spent $54,525,472 in support of Austin Community College during the analysis year of 2001. This dollar amount is weighed against associated educational benefits in the future. This study argues that every dollar of local or state money spent on ACC returns a cumulative $4.59  over the next 5.5 years. Students benefit from an annual return of 26% on their investment of time and money. In addition, for every one dollar the student spends on their education, they will receive a cumulative $9.04 in higher future earnings over the next 30 years. The study concludes that ACC enriches the lives of students while reducing demand for tax-payer supported social services. The study quantifies the effects of ACC on reduction of crime, welfare, and unemployment. (Contains 20 tables and 37 references.) (NB)",

        "description":"This document focuses on two critical measures of California's investment in public education: (1) the extent to which California has provided access to higher education through each of the public segments of higher education; and (2) the extent to which the level of funding per full time student provided to each of the four public segments (UC, CSU, CCC, and k-12) has increased or decreased over time. The analysis shows that California has a very uneven record in providing access to higher education. Particularly in time of recession and budget deficits, the State has regularly denied hundreds of thousands of students the opportunity for higher education. This denial of access occurs in all three segments, but is especially volatile and pronounced in the California Community  Colleges. Also, the report shows that California Community Colleges have become less accessible over time: significantly more access was afforded during the period of 1975 to 1990 than during the period of 1991 to present. Furthermore, it indicates that despite recent efforts to restore access, the State is now entering a period during which it will actually begin to reduce enrollments rather than address the demand to serve 600,000 additional students by 2011.

The mean salary for those employed full time in a new job is $35,875, up $3,083 from the previous year. Almost three-fourths (73.8%) reported being employed after 6 months, which is very similar to last year's  graduating class (74.1%). Almost four fifths of the graduates who responded were either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their jobs, and almost four fifths were either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their opportunity to advance. The respondents gave high marks to WCC on several broad categories such as overall college experience, availability of courses, goals met by college degree, and satisfaction with student services.

Over the past several years, a shift has occurred in the types of disability represented at Gavilan College. Learning disabled is the largest group, but has been proportionally declining as has mobility impaired students while developmentally delayed learners have been proportionally increasing over time. The study finds that leaning disabled students are three times more likely as other students to retain an award or certificate, which includes AA, AS, and Vocational Certificates. The study uses a classification and regression tree that attempts to profile students by using demographic and academic factors as predictors of disability status including age, ethnicity, gender, GPA,  etc. The study concludes that only age was able to classify disability status where those over the age of 62 were more likely to have a non-learning disability. Thus, disabled students are very similar to other students based on these major variables. Overall, it appears that disabled students are performing at a level equal or above non-disabled students and that disabled students are not labeled disproportionately by age, ethnicity, or gender.

It discusses electronic information networks in Canadian colleges, and examines how these networks do and do not develop into communities of learning or communities of practice through sharing conceptualized knowledge, and common values and goals. The study aims to assess the 3-year experiment of creating numerous affinity groups, or national networks of college administrators, staff, faculty, and students who administer, teach, or study in the same domain or discipline. The author sent out an e-mail questionnaire to 134 randomly selected participants in 34 Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC) affinity groups which  had been in existence for at least 6 months. The author conducted in-depth interviews with nine of the 51 respondents. The author also reviewed case studies and used his own experience in meetings and projects. The findings cover motivation for joining affinity groups, development of trust and common values in face to face meetings, the need for ongoing dialogue, the role of technology in achieving group objectives, and working productively with sectoral councils and initiatives.

The EOPS program helps increase college access for students and support services for disadvantages students. The CARE program helps welfare dependent students that are single heads of household and enrolled in full time community colleges system. The study found that EOPS and CARE students persist form term to term at a higher rate than non-EOPS full-time students. The average units attempted and earned by EOPS and CARE students are greater than for non-EOPS full-time students. It should be noted that although EOPS students are more likely to  earn a degree or certificate than other full time students, they are less likely to graduate. In addition, CARE students earn associate degrees and certificates at an even higher rate than other EOPS students, but their transfer rate is much lower at 18.2%. The report concludes that by helping over 106,000 low income and disadvantaged individuals, the EOPS and CARE program have allowed these students to perform at the same level or better than other community college students academically.

        "description":"This document aims to understand the patterns of media consumption among Gavilan students. The goals of the study are to determine the most consumed media product, determine differences in consumption of media modes by different variables, and conduct demographic profiles of the most consumed products within each media mode. The data was gathered from a set of Spring 2003 classes that were randomly selected for survey administration. The study found that almost all respondents reported consuming media of some type in the previous week. The three traditional modes (newspaper, radio, TV) did not show any differences in consumption rates and so appear equally likely to able to reach Gavilan students. About 55% of students indicated that they has visited at least one Web site within  the week that they took the survey. Hispanic oriented media of various modes appears to have much overlap in consumption. The same is true for conservative talk radio, the local TV stations, the Hollister papers, and public access channels. This means that multiple ads in these clusters will reinforce each other rather than expand the scope of the audience. (Contains 4 graphs and 10 tables.) (MZ)",

Alongside their belief in the power of religion to help individuals become better people, most people are also instinctively wary about injecting religion directly into politics, the public schools, and public life in general. The controversial question of prayer in the schools was probed more deeply than other studies by asking people to select their ideal school prayer policy. Given a full range of choices, over half of the people questioned think a moment of silence is the best way to deal with prayer in the classroom. The national survey was conducted with 1507 members of the general public and includes the views of Evangelical Christians,  Catholics, Jews, and nonreligious individuals. Following an Introduction, the report contains nine chapters: (1) \"The Blessings of Religion: Views on How Religion Could Improve American Life\"; (2) \"As the Twig Is Bent: Views on Religion in the Schools\"; (3) \"We Gather Together: Views on Religion and Social Interaction\"; (4) \"Good Government: Views on Religion and Elected Officials\"; (5) \"The More, the Better? Views on Religious Groups in Politics\"; (6) \"Evangelical Christians: Evangelical Views on Religion in Politics, the Schools and Social Life\"; (7)\" Some Beg to Differ: Views of Jewish and Nonreligious Americans on Religion and Public Life\"; (8) \"The Distinctive Voices of Journalists, Christian Leaders and Elected Officials\"; and (9) \"An Afterword\" (Deborah Wadsworth).

Three projects were commissioned: an analysis of existing data on the national supply and career paths of school administrators; surveys of 83 school districts, supplemented by Common Core of Data information, to examine dimensions and implications of the labor market for principal candidates; and examination of research on the attributes and career paths of New York state principals and implications for policy. Researchers investigated whether there is a nationwide shortage of certified candidates, whether certain types of districts find it more difficult than others to attract certified candidates, personal and professional characteristics and career paths of people entering the  field, and how state policies, local conditions, hiring practices, and job incentives affect districts' ability to attract a broader, potentially more able, pool of candidates. Results found no statistical evidence of a nationwide shortage of certified principal candidates. Districts and schools perceived as having the most challenging working conditions, large concentrations of impoverished or minority students, lower per-pupil expenditures, and lower salaries found it hardest to attract principals. Hiring practices and common search criteria were compounding districts' problems in attracting enough principal candidates capable of living up to heightened expectations for academic performance. Policy implications are noted. (Contains 28 endnotes.) (SM)",

It also notes goals and obstacles encountered during this process and how they were overcome. To illustrate this process, the report provides an overview of Tanakh-centered activities for all eight intelligences (linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and natural), offering an in-depth look at the musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, and bodily-kinesthetic intelligences. The obstacles addressed include time factors in preparing, explaining, and implementing MI activities; classroom management adjustment by the teacher and students; and ways to learn the  basic material. The report concludes that MI theory in the Bible classroom aims to target all students, accepting them and the society in which they live, while allowing them to express themselves individually.

Students and teachers completed interviews. Students were asked whether girls in religious high schools perceived their teachers as models for life or sources of information; whether they sought role models and where they found them; whether teacher gender affected their ability to perceive them as role models; and how they perceived teachers as religious figures and the impact of gender on doing so. Teachers were asked whether they were conscious of their function as religious models; how they presented themselves as religious models; types  of religious models they presented; whether they perceived their students as searching for religious models; and whether their efforts at modeling were successful. Students had a self-expressed need for religious direction as the product of an educational system that did not hide complexity. Students and teachers alike probed the implications of exposing students to multiple voices of authority and stressed a need to balance students' long-range educational goals and immediate conflicts and concerns. The school had a dearth of role models and a confusing overabundance of religious figures whose messages often conflicted. (Contains 21 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"This paper asserts that the tenets of a constructivist educational philosophy best meet the needs of special needs students (e.g., those who are limited English speaking, bilingual, low income, and homeless). The first section presents the tenets of a constructivist teaching philosophy. The second section discusses the implementation of best practice. The third section highlights best practices in the areas of instruction and classroom management. Six areas of emphasis for effective teaching are: structure, clarity, redundancy, enthusiasm, appropriate rate, and maximized engagement. An equation for keeping students engaged and interested in a given activity reads EV=M, expectancy of success times the value of completion equals motivation. If students are put into situations that  challenges them, and if students have a high expectancy of success and value their learning of a skill, then they will be highly motivated during the activity. When they are highly motivated, they will be engaged in the activity, leaving no time to misbehave. It is the student teacher's job to design activities that are not only relevant to student needs but also equally motivating to them. Equally important to classroom management are small occurrences, such as greeting students by name at the door in the morning and having a 3:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions throughout the day.

In preparation for the 2003 reauthorization of Head Start, a study examined: the extent to which Head Start met legislative mandates, whether Head Start teacher salaries increased and enabled grantees to attract and retain degreed teachers, and the extent to which degree and other programs in early childhood education are available for Head Start teachers. Results indicated that Head Start met the requirements for teacher  qualifications by increasing the number of teachers with at least an associate degree in early childhood education or a related field to 52 percent. The number of classrooms that did not have at least one teacher with minimum credentials was not known. Respondents noted that quality improvement funds used to pay for teacher training and increase salaries were key to success. Agreements worked out with colleges to provide easily accessible early childhood education courses were also considered important in this effort. (SM)",

NCLB requires regular assessments to mark progress and highlight weaknesses in core academic subjects. Assessment results must be reported in the aggregate and disaggregated by individual subgroups of students. Research shows that teachers who use student test performance to guide and improve their teaching are more effective than teachers who do not. While testing is an important part of measuring progress, how teachers use the data to drive instruction is critical. Standardized assessments are professionally developed tests administered under standard conditions, producing scores that can be used to evaluate programs or children. The type of standardized test  required by NCLB determines whether children within a state are meeting state standards of learning for their grade and subject. Dynamic assessments are embedded in ongoing classroom instruction. Teachers assess individual students according to their instructional goals during teaching and learning interactions, using this information to tailor instruction to student needs and measure progress. Screening assessments are given to all children at the beginning of the class or school year. They identify children who may have difficulties in a subject area. Screening tests are short and involve questions that probe for the presence of basic skills and abilities. (SM)",

The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (NCTAF) has been a catalyst in bringing teacher policy issues to the forefront of federal and state education agendas and is working in several partner states toward enacting policies based on recommendations put forth in its publication, &quot;What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future.&quot; Each partner state commissioned a status of teaching report using a policy inventory created by NCTAF (which addresses getting serious about standards, reinventing teacher preparation and professional  development, fixing teacher recruitment and putting qualified teachers in every classroom, encouraging and rewarding teacher knowledge and skills, and creating schools organized for student and teacher success). This paper outlines common themes found across all state inventories and examines three states (North Carolina, Missouri, and Maine) to provide insight into how states are tackling teacher quality issues and how various policy strategies are being implemented. Common themes include: clear measurable, objective standards for teacher preparation and licensure are not common, student and teacher standards are not well aligned, and teacher supply and demand varies tremendously across districts.

Data come from the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, which has coordinated comparable, nationally representative school-based surveys of teens every 4 years since 1985-86. The HBSC study examines adolescent health and health-related behavior in the context of family, school, and peers, using international comparisons to demonstrate common factors and highlight differences associated with cultural influences. This report provides data on teens age 15 years old, although the study addresses teens age 11, 13, and 15 years. Results  are presented on: (1) \"Health and Well-Being\"; (2) \"Fitness\"; (3) \"Family and Peer Relationships\"; (4) \"School Environment\"; (5) \"Smoking and Alcohol Use\"; and (6) \"Violence.\" Overall, U.S. youth are more likely to have stomachaches, headaches, backaches, and difficulty sleeping than students in most other countries, possibly related to fitness levels. U.S. students find it easy to make new friends but are among the least likely to consider students in their classrooms kind and helpful. U.S. youth are less likely to smoke than students in most countries. They rank relatively high for never or rarely feeling safe at school. (Chapters contain references.) (SM)",

Information for the report includes data collected through the Children's Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program (C-SNAP). The C-SNAP involved a sentinel sample of caregivers of infants and toddlers presenting at pediatric emergency rooms and primary care services for non-life- threatening conditions. Eligible caregivers were interviewed regarding the child's and parent's health, household demographics, use of public assistance programs, and food security. The  main findings are summarized as follows: (1) welfare sanctions and benefits decrease are associated with significantly increased rates of hospitalizations for young children, and these effects were not altered by receipt of food stamp or WIC benefits; (2) welfare sanctions are associated with significantly increased rates of food insecurity in households of young children; (3) in Boston and Minneapolis, infants and toddlers in 2001 had approximately a 40 percent higher risk of food insecurity compared to 1999, a 30 percent higher risk of being underweight, and a 50 percent higher risk of being hospitalized during an emergency room visit. The report's three appendices provide additional detail on the study's methodology, the food security questions, and a description of welfare sanction  policies. (Contains 27 references.) (KB)",

The guide to accreditation provides information on the accreditation process, including implementation of the self-appraisal process; documentation of standards related to program administration, program operation, and home-school-community partnerships; and information on the validation  process, including the validation visit and receipt of the validation decision. Appended is an overview of the accreditation process, including self-appraisal and validation, relevant forms, answers to frequently-asked questions about the standards and accreditation, and a glossary of relevant terms. The instrument for self-appraisal and validation is used by the program and by the validator team to rate the program's implementation of standards for program administration (mission statement, personnel, program continuity, and program accountability), program operation (environment, care and learning opportunities or curriculum, instruction, and assessment), and home-school-community partnerships. The instrument lists indicators rated on a 3-point scale (not met, partially met, or fully  met) for the extent to which the indicator is in place. These indicators are linked to NAEYC standards and to Head Start program performance standards. (KB)",

This guide presents program standards to assist the ongoing development, evaluation, and improvement of early childhood center-based programs and presents content practice standards to provide educators with a common understanding of what young children should know and be able to do. The standards were developed for all Louisiana preschoolers, including students with disabilities and those who are linguistically and culturally diverse, and as such, are not intended to be a curriculum or a checklist nor to limit any child's progress. The guide's introduction describes  principles guiding the standards' development, the content standards' foundation skills, and the information literacy model for lifelong learning. The guide then presents program standards in the following areas: (1) physical environment; (2) transportation; (3) group size/ratios; (4) health/safety practices; (5) nutrition/food service; (6) family involvement/support; (7) staff qualifications and staff development; (8) interactions between staff and children and among children; (9) curriculum; (10) assessment; and (11) collaboration. Following a comparison of developmentally appropriate and inappropriate practices and a sample content standards page, content standards are then offered in the following areas: (1) cognitive development, including mathematical, science, and social studies  development; (2) creative arts development; (3) health and physical development; (4) language and literacy development; and (5) social and emotional development. Each content standard delineates skill areas, broad outcomes, indicators, tips on how to assist children's optimal performance, and links to state K-4 content standards and to standards of various national organizations. All of the content standards are presented in tabular format to facilitate planning. A glossary of relevant terms, a 16-item bibliography, and lists of members of the standards committee and Louisiana Department of Education staff complete the guide. (KB)",

        "description":"Noting that young children need early childhood settings supporting the development of the full range of capacities that will serve as a foundation for future school learning, and that adults have an opportunity and an obligation to assist children in becoming active participants in the learning process, this document details foundations to Indiana's academic standards for preschool children to support the state's teachers, parents, and caregivers as they develop appropriate experiences for young children. The introductory section discusses the importance of developmentally appropriate learning environments for 3- to 5-year-olds, adaptations for exceptional learners, recommended practices for children who are English language learners, and technology for young children. The  remainder of the document presents foundations for young children in the content areas of: (1) English/language arts (reading, reading comprehension, literacy and analysis, writing process, writing application, and listening and speaking); (2) mathematics (number sense, computation, algebra and function, geometry, measurement, and problem solving); (3) science (the nature of science, scientific thinking, environments, and communication); (4) social studies (history, civics and government, geography, economics, and individuals, society, and culture); (5) physical education (gross/fine motor and sensory development, learning and development of motor skills, enjoyment of motor and sensory experiences, responsible personal health and safety practices, and respect for differences); (6) music  (appreciation, participation/exploration/ production, and analysis; and (7) visual arts (appreciation, creating art, and careers and community). Each content section includes an introduction, a statement of the guiding principles behind the foundation, and the early learning foundation for each of the Indiana Academic Standards for Kindergarten. Each individual foundation describes skills appropriate for 3- to 5-year-olds; gives examples of activities to support growth and learning in each area; describes the adult's role; offers suggestions for materials; and presents a variety of scenarios from the classroom, home, or outdoor environment to illustrate experiences addressing the foundation. Resources for adults and children are included at the end of each content area. Completing the  document is a table delineating sequences of developmental growth, and a glossary of relevant terms.

        "description":"Commissioned by the Foundation for Child Development, this report examines the state of universal prekindergarten in the United States and the challenges to its widespread implementation. The report describes socioeconomic and ethnic/racial differences in school readiness and maintains that policymakers need to identify mechanisms in addition to UPK that help trigger productive experiences for preschool children. It is noted that quality in program and staff are often too low in many preschool programs. One of the major challenges for UPK, the report notes, is to provide access for the middle class and near poor children who do not qualify for Head Start and cannot afford unsubsidized nursery schools. Efforts in states such as Georgia and Florida are cited to illustrate the  leadership efforts required to expand UPK in a fiscally stressed environment. The report notes that although the diverse settings in which early care and education are currently offered provide the rudiments of a UPK infrastructure, and that there is a precedent in the United States for fashioning an infrastructure from a combination of existing private and public providers, some UPK advocates steadfastly separate issues of UPK from those of child care, fearing that mixing the two will undermine the campaign for UPK. Public opinion in the United States is described as viewing prekindergarten as a downward extension of formal education and child care as a family responsibility. The report argues that it would be beneficial to regard prekindergarten and full-day kindergarten as part of the  educational experience from age 3 to age 8, a P-3 continuum. It is asserted that a more comprehensive approach to education, including the use of the summer months, can help students retain the advances they make at each level. The report concludes by reiterating that the movement for universal prekindergarten collides with state and federal deficits, suffers from negative comparisons to Head Start programs in the &quot;Head Start reauthorization wars,&quot; and requires bold, creative methods to maintain momentum.

        "author":["Hampton, Jim"],
        "description":"In 2002, Florida voters placed on the ballot through petition and passed a state constitutional amendment mandating universal prekindergarten (UPK) for all 4-year-olds beginning in 2005; it was the nation's first voter-initiated, mandated UPK. This case study examines Florida's successful UPK campaign. The report highlights the leadership of David Lawrence Jr., the former publisher of The Miami Herald and chairman of the Florida Partnership for School Readiness (the gubernatorially appointed state board overseeing Florida's programs of child care and early education), and of Alex Penelas, the executive mayor of Miami-Dade County. The major impetus for the amendment was the 1999 School Readiness Act, which created the Florida Partnership for School Readiness to administer all  child care, health, and educational programs for children birth to age 5, to allocate combined state and federal funding, and which required local School Readiness Coalitions. Rules suggested for achieving success in passing a constitutional amendment include: (1) polling to assess support for and opposition to UPK; (2) ensuring that the proposal can pass the state constitutions own legal tests and possible challenges; (3) raising money to gather the required petitions; and (4) hiring a professional petition-gatherer. Efforts to promote the UPK amendment included rallies and informational meetings, focus groups, and major conferences. The case study highlights the importance of identifying which vested interests are apprehensive about UPK and trying to allay their fears in every possible  forum. Additional local actions described in the case study include the creation of The Children's Trust in Miami-Dade County and the passage of a levy for a half-mill (50 cents per $1,000 assessed valuation) property tax to finance its programs. State action included the formation of a UPK Advisory Council to analyze programmatic aspects and outcomes for UPK programs. Remaining challenges to the Governor and the legislature include selecting a government agency to house UPK and selecting someone to head the program. A summary of recommendations regarding UPK from the Florida Partnership for School Readiness is appended. (Contains 35 footnotes.) (KB)",

        "description":"Oklahoma is one of three states to offer a free prekindergarten (pre-K) program to all students in participating school districts on a voluntary basis. Fortuitous circumstances in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the state's largest school district, permitted an unusually rigorous evaluation of the pre-K program in Tulsa. Because 4-year-olds beginning pre-K and 5-year-olds beginning kindergarten were administered the same test in September 2001 and because strict eligibility cutoffs were applied (based on date of birth), it was possible to control for selection effects, in addition to gender, race/ethnicity, school lunch eligibility, and precise date of birth. The evaluation showed strong positive effects of the pre-K program on children's language and cognitive test scores, but not on scores  for social-emotional or motor skills. Hispanic children benefited most from the program, and Black children also showed sharp gains, especially when they attended full-day programs. In contrast, only those white children enrolled in a half-day pre-K program showed significant gains and only in language skills. A similar pattern of results characterized children who qualified for free lunch, for whom significant benefits derived from full- and part-day programs; children who qualified for a reduced price lunch, for whom only full-day programs produced gains; and children who did not qualify for lunch benefits, where no net gain was apparent. The findings were examined in light of contemporary controversies regarding targeted or universal pre-K programs; full- or part-day programming;  public school or multiple delivery sites; strategies for ensuring high quality, effective programs; and the need for rigorous program evaluations.

        "description":"In Arizona and around the country, there is an increased focus on ensuring that children start school ready to learn. Noting that the best way to know if Arizona's children are starting school ready to learn is to track their progress, this booklet details indicators or benchmarks in five categories used to measure the state's progress in school readiness efforts: (1) reading at grade level, based on standardized testing at third and fourth grades; (2) risk factors (young child poverty rates, children born into families with multiple risk factors, percent of first-graders in special education, and student mobility); (3) access to services (percent of poor 3- and 4-year-olds enrolled in Head Start, percent of low-income children under age 6 without health insurance, lack of  adequate prenatal care, and percent of low-income children receiving assistance through Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]); (4) quality of early education (child care providers' salaries relative to kindergarten teachers' salaries, preschool teachers' salaries relative to kindergarten teachers' salaries, and percent of licensed child care centers that are NAEYC accredited); and (5) readiness of schools (percent of fourth-graders in classes with 25 or fewer children). The indicator data show that the state's reading achievement scores remained stable between 1992 and 2002 but lagged behind the national average. About 20 percent of Arizona's children under age 5 currently live in poverty. About 8 percent of first-graders are placed in special  education classes. Almost 60 percent of poor 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in Head Start. About one-third of Arizona's low-income children under age 6 lack health insurance. In Arizona, the salaries of child care providers and preschool teachers are a fraction of kindergarten teacher salaries. Slightly over 10 percent of licensed child care centers in the state are accredited through NAEYC. About half of Arizona's fourth-graders are in classes with 25 or fewer children, compared to 64 percent nationally. (KB)",

The study considered whether the qualifications provided a clear framework, how the qualifications are understood and accepted by employers and students, and the extent to which qualifications meet the requirement to support integrated service delivery. Information was collected through surveys and interviews with training providers, child care providers, current students, and key stakeholders. A relational database was constructed to compare the content of 13 current awards in early education, child care, and playwork to 15  topics drawn from an analysis of the standards and quality indicators in The National Care Standards and The Child at the Centre (a guide to self-evaluation for early years workers). Findings revealed that the mandatory components of the 13 awards offered common content across only 2 of the 15 topics: (1) organization of children and young people's play and learning; and (2) safety. Despite variations, there was a core purpose common to the awards, centering on working with children, safety, and professional relationships. Training providers and key stakeholders felt that child care providers had a very poor understanding of the qualifications framework. Although many interviewees felt that the theoretical aspects of awards equipped people to deal with the practical elements of the work,  child care providers were concerned with increasing the practical elements of the awards. Although informal links between training providers and employers were plentiful, they did not represent the full range of employers involved in the sector. Child care providers and students were not fully familiar with the Care Standards. Interviewees made suggestions for improving the content of training to better meet future needs of the early care and education sector. (KB)",

The indicators are not academic standards themselves, but focus on preschool through Grade 2 skills in reading, writing, speaking and listening, and mathematics. Based on child development theory and authentic observations of the steps young children move through to reach the academic standards, the measurable indicators provide educators with information concerning what learners should know and be able to do across a continuum of age or grade ranges. Included in the document are suggestions for using the indicators and suggestions for implementation. Indicators related to  reading, writing, speaking, and listening include the areas of reading independently; reading critically in all content areas; reading, analyzing, and interpreting literature; types of writing; quality of writing; speaking and listening; characteristics and functions of the English language; and research. Mathematics indicators are in the areas of numbers, number systems, and number relationships; computation and estimation; measurement and estimation; mathematical reasoning and connections; mathematical problem solving and communication; statistics and data analysis; probability and predictions; algebra and functions; geometry; trigonometry; and calculus concepts.

        "description":"The Words Work! early literacy initiative, in Ramsey Action Program (RAP) Head Start centers, was initiated to prepare children to be successful third-grade readers and mathematicians. These reports reflect the standardized test results collected in years 1 and 2 for the first cohort of Words Work! children from four RAP Head Start centers who recently completed first and second grade, respectively, in St. Paul, Minnesota public schools. Three comparison groups were identified for the evaluations: (1) non-Words Work! RAP Head Start children in 10 centers; (2) children who were on the RAP waiting list; and (3) a random sample of non-Head Start children. Test scores were adjusted based on the average demographic characteristics of children across all study groups. An analysis of  variance model was used to compare the group means. Based on this model, Words Work! children, on average, performed at a higher level than those in all three comparison groups in reading, mathematics, and language arts. Mathematics appeared to be the strongest subject for Words Work! children, followed by reading and language arts. The third-year evaluation report notes continued performance of subjects at higher levels than comparison groups, and also evaluates specific program characteristics. The findings from the study suggest that Head Start programs that utilize Words Work! literacy-rich environments can make a difference. The report's three appendices include information on ethnicity and language characteristics of each study group, examples of adjusted scores, and confidence  intervals.

This guide presents school readiness performance standards for 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds and is the result of a workgroup and advisory committee formed with representatives of district school systems, child care and health care providers, state agency partners, and state and national experts in child development, special needs, and measurement and assessment. The guide's prologue offers directions for using the standards most effectively. The remainder of the guide details the standards, organized by area of child development: (1)  physical health; (2) approaches to learning; (3) social and emotional development; (4) language and communication; (5) cognitive development and general knowledge; and (6) motor development. Within each area of development, standards are organized by childs chronological age with cross-references to Head Start standards and two sets of Florida state standards. Accompanying each standard are examples illustrating some of the many ways that growth, development, and learning can be assured in the context of the learning experiences characterizing a stimulating learning environment.

        "description":"The Building Blocks to Colorado's Content Standards were developed to connect early childhood education to the K-12 content standards, to advocate for appropriate teaching strategies for preschool children, and to support awareness and understanding of early childhood foundational skills among parents and teachers. Five sets of building blocks are being developed, in the areas of science, social skills, the arts, reading and writing, and mathematics. This document is comprised of the reading and writing and the mathematics sets of building blocks. Both sets begin with an introduction summarizing research findings on the connection between quality early childhood programs and later academic, social, and emotional success. The reading and writing building blocks continue with a  list of recommended teaching practices from the joint position statement of the International Reading Association and the National Association for the Education of Young Children. The mathematics building blocks continue with a discussion of mathematical literacy. Both sets of building blocks follow with a list of the relevant Colorado Content Standards for the K-12 system, followed by a more detailed description of each standard. This description is coupled with an Early Childhood Foundation for each standard--statements that reflect the types of experiences and interactions preschoolers need in order to develop the foundation for attaining the standards. Each individual standard is then broken down into three sections: (1) &quot;building blocks for learning,&quot; describing skills appropriate  for preschoolers, indicators of the early childhood curriculum that can be used as a guide in creating learning experiences and individualized plans for young children; (2) &quot;steps for getting there,&quot; examples of interactions and experiences necessary for acquiring the building blocks, including descriptions of the adult's role as a facilitator of learning and suggestions for appropriate materials; and (3) examples of activities in which young children are engaged. The reading and writing building blocks section ends with a 13-item bibliography. The mathematics building blocks section ends with a 17-item bibliography and a list of 18 books for children. (KB)",

        "description":"Self-regulation of behavior generally refers to controlled, cognitive monitoring of the actions and steps required to obtain a goal, or to bring about a desired response from the environment. Age-related changes in self-regulation as well as individual differences at a given age or developmental stage play fundamental roles in shaping children's experiences and the responses children elicit from caregivers and others. However individual differences in children's temperamental emotional reactivity and the ability to control this reactivity are also important for understanding developing self regulation. This Spanish-language Digest focuses on emotional reactivity and its relation to the development of cognitive functions that promote self-regulation in young children. The Digest  examines how emotions may influence the development of the cognitive functions that contribute to successful self-regulation and thereby to school readiness. Implications for caregivers are then detailed, including the following: (1) high quality preschool education programs can best promote school readiness by helping to secure the social and emotional foundation upon which children can build cognitive skills; and (2) preschool activities that exercise impulse control, sustained attention, and working memory are likely to promote the development of cognitive skills important for knowledge acquisition in the early elementary grades.

        "description":"Communication and the exchange of information are key components of the relationships between parents of young children and the staff of programs that serve them. Professionals who work with families are likely to be more effective when they are aware of how aspects of their own communication practices may affect parents' ability and willingness to engage with a program in the interests of their children. This Digest discusses the limited research and literature on parents' intellectual and physical access to information provided by programs that serve young children. In terms of intellectual access to information, the Digest notes that access to information can be seriously compromised by differences in reading level, understanding of jargon, vocabulary, and home language among  parents and program staff. In terms of physical access to information, the Digest notes that distance and sensory or physical disabilities may impede access to information, and that programmatic factors such as scheduling may also interfere with people's ability to connect with information sources. The Digest concludes by noting that two-way open and frequent communication between parents and the people outside the family increases the likelihood that the exchange of information can be coordinated and provided in ways that have a direct or indirect positive impact on children's development.

        "description":"Higher-quality child care during the first 3 years of a child's life may have strong and enduring effects on the child's development and well-being. One practice that is theorized to promote higher quality of care is the provision of continuity of caregivers for young children. Continuity of caregivers means that infants and toddlers remain with the same teacher(s) during a significant part, if not all, of their first years in a program. The practice is intended to create a consistent personal relationship between a child and a teacher. This Digest describes the practice as it is usually implemented, discusses the theory and research behind the practice, and offers suggestions for centers interested in offering continuity of caregivers. These suggestions include: (1) recruiting  new children to fill in at upper age levels when it is more appropriate to have more children per adult; (2) using mixed-age groupings; and (3) rewarding staff for longevity with the program. The Digest concludes by noting that the actual effects associated with the practice are based only on theoretical assumption and limited research, and that center staff may require more compelling evidence that a practice is a better option before undertaking the substantial modifications that are required in making a significant change.

Studied were changes over time in teacher candidate reflection themes; perceptions of the portfolio process, its value, and construction; and the impact of portfolio implementation on professional development. Lesson reflections, weekly reflection logs, focus group interviews, and portfolio questionnaires served as qualitative data sources. Findings demonstrated many similarities in teacher candidate reflection themes for both universities during the 3-semester portfolio implementation. The  findings revealed the importance of time and a structured plan for accomplishing positive professional development among teacher candidates. Teacher candidates exposed to a well developed and executed conceptual framework of coaching and conditions to promote adult development faired better than their counterparts without such an explicit framework.

Information was categorized for each article with respect to authors' gender, multiple versus single authorship, study design, use of statistics, age of subjects, number of subjects, and kind of research. There was no significant trend by year for the number of articles published by sole vs. multiple authors or by men, women, or male/female co-authors. More than 70% of the articles had multiple authors. There was no significant trend by year for design of study, statistics used, or number of subjects in the study. There was, however, a trend away from applied research after 1996. There were no applied research studies published 1997-1999 while  approximately one literacy-focused applied research article a year was published 1991-1996. There was also some movement away from studies with &quot;n&quot; larger than 1000 from 1995 through 1999. The total number of articles focused on literacy decreased from 1996. The average number of articles published with a literacy focus 1990-1995 was 12.38. The average number 1996-1999 was 5.75. With respect to design, approximately 50% of the articles published were experimental while 22% were correlational and 21% were descriptive. Approximately 36% of the articles used ANOVA, 20% used correlation including multiple regression, 17% used descriptive statistics including percentages and frequencies, and 13% used other multivariate techniques such as MANOVA. The remaining articles employed path analysis,  M/ANOVA with multiple regression, Yates' algorithm, chi square, factor analysis, or no statistics (4%). Fifty-four percent of the articles had elementary school subjects, 15% high school subjects, 14% multiple-age subjects (often children and their parents and/or teachers), 5% middle school subjects, 4% college students, 5% other adults, and 2% no human subjects.

While the goals of school integration legally inspired by Brown v. Board of Education are very broad, this paper focuses on the contribution of school racial composition to the racial and ethnic achievement. It uses a unique matched panel data set on individual Texas students and schools to identify the impacts of racial composition on academic achievement and to differentiate these from other aspects of school quality and from differences in student ability and family background that might drive any observed relationship between achievement and school demographic composition. Results show  that having a higher percentage of black schoolmates has a strong adverse effect on black students' achievement, and the effects are highly concentrated in students who have shown high academic achievement in the early grades. Racial composition has a noticeably smaller effect on the achievement of lower ability Blacks, of Whites, and Hispanics, suggesting that the results are not a simple reflection of unmeasured school quality. The results are consistent with the view that black students exert peer pressure on others to under-perform and that a higher proportion of Blacks in a school may lead teachers to lower their expectations for all black students.

        "description":"Many school districts experience difficulties attracting and retaining teachers, and schools in urban areas serving economically disadvantaged and minority students appear particularly vulnerable to these problems. This paper investigates factors that affect the probabilities that teachers will switch schools or exit the public schools entirely. Researchers used matched student/teacher panel data on Texas public elementary schools to gain a better understanding of the effects of salary and other school factors on teacher transitions. These data permitted a detailed description of student demographic and school characteristics and pre- and post-move comparisons for teachers who switched schools within Texas or left the Texas public schools. Teachers were divided by experience,  school community type, ethnicity and other factors so researchers could examine differences in the responsiveness to salary and student characteristics on the basis of teacher experience, race, and ethnicity. Results indicate that teacher mobility is much more strongly related to characteristics of students, particularly race and achievement, than to salary, although salary exerts a modest impact once compensating differentials are taken into account. Non-black, non Hispanic teachers systematically prefer non-black, non-Hispanic students, while the opposite is true for black and Hispanic teachers. (Contains 56 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"Most students change schools at some point in their academic careers, but some change very frequently, and some schools experience a great deal of turnover. Many researchers, teachers, and administrators argue that mobility harms students, particularly disadvantaged students in high turnover, inner city schools. However, economists emphasize the importance of Tiebout mobility in which parents change districts in pursuit of higher quality schools. Empirical research on mobility has yielded inconclusive results. This paper develops a general theoretical model that identifies school quality changes resulting from moving. The empirical analysis, which exploits the rich longitudinal data of the University of Texas at Dallas Texas Schools Project, disentangles the disruption effects  associated with moves from changes in school quality. The results suggest that there is a small average increase in school quality for district switchers, while there is no evidence that those switching schools within districts obtain higher school quality on average. The results also show a significant externality from moves: students in schools with high turnover suffer a disadvantage, and the cost is largest for lower income and minority students who typically attend much higher turnover schools.

Researchers analyzed four types of novice teachers, including those who: taught continuously in the same district all 5 years, transferred to another district within the state but remained in the state all 5 years, left public school teaching in a state and did not return to teaching, and left public school teaching in a state but returned. Statements were gathered from 5-year veterans regarding their reasons for staying with teaching. Over the 5 years, the cumulative loss of beginning teachers from the district that hired them was just over 50 percent (half of whom left teaching altogether). Minority teachers and  teachers who entered the profession at age 30 or younger departed at significantly higher rates. While minority teachers were less likely to leave teaching altogether, they were much more likely to transfer among school districts. There was no significant difference in turnover by gender. Teachers with graduate degrees had lower turnover rates. Urban teachers were significantly more likely to move out of their district (though not to leave teaching). Mathematics and science teachers were much more likely to leave teaching and less likely to transfer among districts. (Contains 30 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"In 1992, UNICEF signed an agreement with the government of Egypt to develop and coordinate a community schools project in the deprived villages of rural upper Egypt. Four pilot sites were selected in the governorate of Assiut based on minimum numbers of out-of-school children, lack of a school nearby, and the eagerness of the community to participate in the provision and management of the school. Genuine community involvement was considered critical to project success. Classes were scheduled at times convenient to community and family schedules. Maximum class size was 30 children with 2 facilitators. The facilitators were young women recruited locally and given intensive training in innovative teaching techniques. These included the use of art and music, self-learning, peer  teaching, active learning, and enhancement of the official curriculum with subjects and activities relevant to the community and children's interests. In the second year, adult literacy classes were begun with trained, local women coordinators. The community schools became focal points for health services and community development activities. Outside evaluations showed that all children in the pilot schools completed first grade satisfactorily. By 1995, 125 community schools were in operation, with a 70 percent female enrollment rate and many positive outcomes. Remaining challenges are discussed, as well as program expansion and the need to integrate the community schools with a rural school project of the Egyptian government. (Contains photographs.) (SV)",

Of particular concern was identifying variables to assist educators, parents, and other child advocates in providing academic programs that are responsive to the needs of learners. Data were taken from the 1996-1997 academic year using school districts in Georgia's 159 counties. Thirty of the 40 correlations were statistically significant and documented that lower academic performance in science and mathematics is related to high unemployment, high infant mortality, high enrollment in remedial classes, high drop out rates, low income, low number of adults with high school diplomas, and low enrollment in gifted classes.  The analysis verifies strong relationships between school performance and specific community and school characteristics. (Author/SOE)",

        "description":"This action research project was designed to increase students' math competencies and reduce math anxiety in targeted high school classes in a Midwestern suburb. The study included 37 students and took place from September through December in 2002. Factors influencing students' math achievement included self-perceptions of math competence, teachers' perceptions of students' abilities, and an overemphasis on remediation which left students unchallenged and behind their peers (Fiore, 1999). Curriculum redesign is one way of improving students' confidence and competence in their math abilities (Allexsaht-Snider and Hart, 2001). Given this, a curriculum redesign was selected as an intervention for this study. To document student progress in mathematical achievement and improve  self-perception, methods of assessment used included surveys, document analysis, and observations. Post-intervention data indicated an increase in students' comfort level related to math competencies. A review of solution strategies suggested within the literature, combined with an analysis of the setting, resulted in the selection of three primary solutions to be used as interventions: (1) a curriculum redesign that minimized tracking; (2) a constructivist teaching approach; and (3) the establishment of a community of learners. Data also revealed that students in the targeted groups were successful as a result of curriculum redesign. It is encouraged and suggested that discourse related to curriculum tracking provoked by this project continue within the site to further support students'  math competencies. (Author/SOE)",

The approach to professional development that emerged in this inquiry was premised on a belief held by the author, a university researcher, and two K-1 teachers that professional development opportunities for teachers need to be ongoing, allow time for teachers to engage in learning, and occur in a collaborative community of learners. Over an eight month period from October 2000 to May 2001, the researchers developed and implemented science curriculum that targeted a K-1 multi- age classroom of 40 students. One of the main objectives of the inquiry was to foster the development of teacher professional knowledge in the context of primary science education. The second objective was to explore the nature of the  collaborative inquiry that emerged and its influence on the development of teachers' professional knowledge. Two questions guided this study: (1) How will the participating teachers enhance their professional knowledge as a result of this experience?; and (2) Under what conditions will this approach to professional development be effective? The processes and contextual variables that contributed to the overall effectiveness of the approach are identified and described as well as outcomes related to the development of collaborating teachers' knowledge base for teaching primary science.

It describes the different reasons for high mobility and the characteristics of highly mobile families, explains the specific educational and social support needs of highly mobile students, and briefly reviews the findings on effective school programs and classroom practices. Highly mobile students include the children of migrant workers, of families experiencing domestic violence, of families in unstable work and home situations that result from high poverty, and of military and immigrant families. The academic consequences of high mobility are severe. High mobility hits urban children particularly hard. Inner city students are  more likely to change schools frequently. Children of migrant workers cross school, district, and state lines. Subgroups within the migrant population include students with disabilities and older immigrant youth who enter school with little prior educational experience. To address school stability issues of homeless children, Congress passed the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act, which allows homeless students to remain in their original schools, even if they no longer live in the residency area, and schools must provide transportation.

The first study, by Ronald Ferguson, analyzed data on middle and high school students from the Minority Student Achievement Network. In the second study, John Ogbu investigated how K-12 African American students' identity as an oppressed group affected academic achievement and school experiences. The digest describes the fundamentals of the two arguments and points to the key differences in the authors' perspectives on how schools should help minority students be more academically successful. The first study concluded that schools should never assume systematic group-level differences in student effort or motivation and that schools should identify and respond to particular groups'  specific skill and knowledge deficit problems, provide encouragement routinely, and offer more educational resources and learning experiences. The second study found that many African American students did not consider schooling preparation for future job success. They felt disparaged and disrepresented in the community, despite appearances of racial harmony. Whites considered the achievement gap due to social class, while blacks considered it due to racism. African Americans were unengaged in attitudes and behaviors needed for school success. They recognized the need for effort to meet high academic standards but chose not to make the effort. They were often not educated in honors or advanced placement classes because they had been assigned to less academically rigorous tracks in lower  grades. (SM)",

The Hispanic dropout rate fell from 21.8 percent in 1990 to 21.1 percent in 2000, (three times greater than the 2000 non-Hispanic white  dropout rate). The aggregate Hispanic high school dropout rate is a poor indicator of secondary school performance. Distinguishing between those who have never been exposed to U.S. schools and those who have is critical for the prospects and design of appropriate interventions. Hispanic immigrants educated in the United States have no worse educational outcomes than native-born Hispanics. Third generation Hispanics perform no better than their second generation peers. Among Hispanics who do not graduate from high school, about 40 percent obtain a GED certificate(Contains 13 references.) (SM)",

Statistical Analysis Report.&quot; Principals at 3,314 nationally-representative K-12 schools described incidents of crime and violence, disciplinary problems and actions, use of security measures, safety policies and practices, violence prevention programs and activities, and school characteristics. Overall, 71 percent of schools experienced at least one violent incident, 20 percent experienced at least one seriously violent incident, 36 percent reported at least one violent incident to the police, and 15 percent reported at least one seriously violent incident to the police. Only 6 out of 17 school characteristics accounted  for the prevalence of violence (demographics, urbanicity, academic achievement, number of classroom changes during the school day, number of schoolwide disruptions, and number of discipline problems). Five characteristics related to serious violence (enrollment size, percent of males, number of schoolwide disruptions, number of serious discipline problems, and urbanicity). Characteristics of schools with high violence included enrollment size, urbanicity, neighborhood crime, number of classroom changes, number of serious discipline problems, and number of schoolwide disruptions. Characteristics of schools with high serious violence included enrollment size, students below the 15th percentile on standardized tests, student-teacher ratio, number of serious discipline problems, number of  students transferring from the school, and number of schoolwide disruptions.

        "description":"This monograph in the Urban Diversity Series examines historical and current policy in the teaching of language minority students in New York and California. It explores the key issues in the public's understanding of bilingual education and defines bilingual education in terms of local educational legislation and implementations. Part I, &quot;Teaching Language Minorities: Theory and Reality in New York City,&quot; discusses the history of bilingual education programs in New York City public schools and the theories that frame bilingual education policy. Using data from the New York City Department of Education (formerly, the Board of Education), it presents information on English Language Learner (ELL) enrollment from 1987 to 2002 and New York City and New York State standards for  classifying students as Limited English Proficient or English Language Learners. The paper also analyzes the effectiveness of the bilingual education program in terms of reclassification rates of ELLs and general student achievement. Part II, &quot;Dismantling Bilingual Education: The Impact of Proposition 227 in California,&quot; analyzes the implementation of Proposition 227 in California and its outcomes. The paper looks specifically at: 1) California law on instruction for English Learners before and after Proposition 227 and the implementation of Proposition 227 by school districts; 2) the process by which a child is designated limited-English proficient or English Learner, the characteristics of these students, and rates in the number of students redesignated fluent-English-proficient; 3)  bilingual education enrollment before and after Proposition 227 and the characteristics of the students enrolled; 4) testing rates for all English Learners and English Learners enrolled in bilingual education; and 5) the impact of bilingual education on achievement in California and nationwide. Two appendices to the second part describe interpretations of Proposition 227 requirements for structured immersion in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco and Interpretations of Informed Consent and circumstances justifying parental waiver of Proposition 227 in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco.

ADL was undertaken to make instructional material universally accessible primarily, but not solely, through delivery on the World Wide Web. The ADL initiative was begun by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in cooperation with the White House Office of Science and Technology (OSTP). It is intended to make education, training, and performance aiding available anytime, anywhere, and to anyone through the use of asynchronous, computer-mediated instruction. The purpose of this paper is to describe the ADL initiative to  educators and educational researchers and to invite their participation in shaping and guiding its development and implementation to ensure its contribution to education practice and processes. ADL is of obvious importance to professionals concerned with training and education, but it has promise for other audiences as well. Included among these are individuals in schools serving rural areas remote from libraries and museums, minority students in urban areas attending schools with limited resources, and students seeking elective course offerings in specialized subject areas.

The guide addresses the key issues surrounding vouchers, including the religious affiliations of many private schools receiving voucher funds, the ambiguity of evidence on academic gains for voucher students, parent satisfaction with private versus public schools, competition as an incentive for public schools, and financial impacts of vouchers on public  schools. The guide suggests questions parents and communities should pose when considering voucher programs, including: To what extent is a private school accountable to government regulation? By what criteria does a private school admit and reject students? The guide provides a list of selected readings. (SM)",

The issue most frequently identified as most critical was accountability, with staffing next, followed by discipline, time, funding, external support, parents, safety, special education, and plant operations, in that order. Findings of a survey of teachers by Phi Delta Kappa show that teachers most frequently cite the lack of parental support and interest as the most critical issue. Parents, responding to a Gallup poll, have identified the lack of financial support/funding/spending money as the most critical issue. The focus of this paper is on accountability and the demands  accountability requirements place on principals. A plan is outlined to help principals engage teachers in improving school performance scores as related to accountability programs. The outlined plan was used in 2001-2002 at a high school in Louisiana and was judged to have increased school performance. Strategies are also suggested for fostering parent engagement.

The study consisted of three related field tests. In each, researchers worked with six Law School Admission Test (LSAT) test specialists and one or more of the LSAT subtests. The three field tests produced a number of conclusions. A considerable amount was learned about the process of extracting test specialists' estimates of item difficulty. The ratings took considerably longer to obtain than had been expected. Training, initial ratings, and discussion took a considerable amount of time. Test specialists felt they could be trained to estimate item difficulty accurately and, to some extent, they demonstrated this.  Average error in the estimates of item difficulty varied from about 11% to 13 %. Also the discussions were popular with the panelists, and almost always resulted in improved item difficulty estimates. By the end of the study, the two expected frameworks that developers thought they might provide test specialists, had merged to one. Test specialists seemed to benefit from the descriptions of items located at three levels of difficulty and from information about the item statistics of many items.

        "description":"In this study, data from an operational computerized adaptive test (CAT) were examined in order to gather information concerning item response times in a CAT environment. The CAT under study included multiple-choice items measuring verbal, quantitative, and analytical reasoning. The analyses included the fitting of regression models describing the relations of item parameters, ability measures, and item serial position with item-level response times. All of these analyses were performed for data collected under two different conditions: the first in which the test takers were only required to answer 80% of the items to receive a score, and the second in which the test-taker score was proportional to the number of items answered. The results for 2 datasets, 1 with 21,366 test  takers and 1 with 11,301 test takers were compared. The results show that ability is predictive of item-level response times for items on the verbal section for both datasets, while item difficulty is predictive of item-level response times for certain sets of quantitative and analytical items. In each case, the regression equations explain more of the variability in the item-level response times when the data were administered under the proportional adjustment scoring rule. An appendix describes the method used and gives an example. (Contains 11 tables, 13 figures, and 29 references.) (Author/SLD)",

However, initial research indicates that teams making decisions about instructional and statewide assessment accommodations and teachers implementing these accommodations are ill prepared to do so. In the 2002-2003 school year, a study group of the special education State Collaborative on Assessment and Student Standards (SCASS) undertook a two-part research effort to address this issue. They surveyed 22 former and current members of  the SCASS regarding the extent and focus of state level training and gathered and analyzed accommodations training resources. The results reflect a paucity of in-depth state staff development to help local school personnel and parents understand the need for and implications of instructional and statewide assessment accommodations. States reported more training in accommodations fro statewide assessment than for instruction. However, a number of promising resources were identified and indexed for SCASS adaptation and use. Recommendations are provided for the states regarding: (1) how they might approach accommodations training for both instruction and statewide assessment; (2) the potential content of the instruction; and (3) resources that might be adopted or adapted for these purposes.

        "description":"An active area in psychometric research is coordinated task design and statistical analysis built around cognitive models. Compared with classical test theory and item response theory, there is often less information from observed data about the measurement-model parameters. On the other hand, there is more information from the grounding psychological theory, and the task designer's insights into which patterns of skills lead to which patterns of performance. The paper describes a Bayesian approach to modeling these situations, which uses experts' judgments to produce prior distributions for the conditional probabilities in a multivariate latent-variable model, and Monte Carlo Markov Chain estimation to refine the estimated. Task-design schemes and expert judgments are used in  the first phase to structure the conditional probability tablethat is, conjunctive, compensatory, or disjunctive models, or combinations thereof. Machinery form graded-response item response theory is used to translate experts' judgments about task requirements into prior distributions for model parameters, which in turn imply values for all the conditional probabilities. Bayesian estimation methods are then used to update the distributions for the model parameters in response to observed data. The approach is illustrated with examples from the Biomass biology assessment prototype. (Contains 9 figures, 12 tables, and 25 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Results indicate a fair level of agreement among the raters who scored the assignments and a high level of internal consistency within four dimensions of assignment quality. The stability of the ratings and the number of assignments needed to yield a consistent estimate of quality differed by elementary and secondary  school levels.

This publication is about conditions that help create and perpetuate achievement gaps. It focuses on the many antecedents of differences in school achievement college-going rates. The effort begins with identifying school and home conditions that the research community, to a reasonable extent, agrees are closely associated with school achievement. Sometimes this does not mean complete agreement, since research is a continuing process of thesis and antithesis. For each of the 14 correlates of achievement examined, data were sought that would permit the disaggregation by race/ethnicity and some measure of  family income or socioeconomic status. In all 14 cases, such data were available for race and ethnicity, and in 12 cases, data were also available for some measure of income. The report begins with a description of the process used, the sources of research findings, and a brief overview of the 14 correlates of achievement, along with whether there are racial, ethnic, or income differences. A detailed review of the research follows. (Contains 2 tables and 22 graphs.) (SLD)",

The first part of the paper discusses common scales used to assess writing products, then briefly describes various methods of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) and reviews several AES programs currently in use. It also presents empirical results attesting to the reliability and validity of these programs, principally with regard to essays written in English. The second part of the paper presents various linguistic features that may vary extensively across languages and examines the ramifications of these features on the complexity of  the AES operational system. This analysis is presented chiefly with regard to Hebrew and English, which are used to illustrate the differences that may exist between languages. (Contains 5 tables and 30 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This document, put together by the Director of Santa Barbara City College Student Health Service, discusses how in the 108 community colleges in California the student health centers are in danger as administrators ponder budget cuts. To clarify the gravity of the situation, the report focuses on the Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) Student Health Services and Wellness Program (SHSWP). The report explains the success of the SHSWP by focusing on the following areas: (1) the need of the students for mental health counseling services and health education programs; (2) the academic programs and services initiated by the SHSWP that address the needs of the students; (3) the way that SHSWP has presented their model of success at local, state, and national conferences in order to  encourage successful programs at community colleges across the U.S.; (4) program specifics; (5) data demonstrating the impact of the program; (6) demonstration of increased access, retention, completion or transfer rates for underrepresented students; and (7) program replicability. The document concludes with the conclusion that the SHSWP is only one example of a successful program that exists in California community colleges and how such programs should receive more recognition for their important contribution to students, the school, and society.

        "description":"This study examined strategy use in producing lexical collocations among freshman English majors at the Chinese Culture University. Divided into two groups by English writing proficiency, students completed three tasks: a collocation test, an optimal revision task, and a task-based structured questionnaire regarding their actions and mental processes involved in producing lexical collocations. Overall, retrieval, literal translation, de-lexicalized verbs, synonyms, and appeal to authority were the most effective types of strategy use leading to production of acceptable collocations. While good writers made better use of retrieval, de-lexicalized verbs, synonyms, and appeal to authority in producing acceptable collocations, poor writers used literal translation more successfully  than good writers. The top four types of ineffective strategy use were literal translation, retrieval, approximate translation, and use of de-lexicalized verbs. Literal translation and approximate translation troubled good writers most, and retrieval and literal translation troubled poor writers most. Although a general pattern of strategy use could be observed in the production of acceptable/unacceptable collocations, there were individual differences in choice of preferred effective strategy use among good and poor writers. Implications for teaching and learning lexical collocations are noted. The collocation test is appended. (Contains 28 references.) (SM)",

        "description":"A study investigated possible reasons for the low performance in 2000 on the writing portion of the Delaware Student Testing Program (DSTP) by students, especially in grades 3 and 5. The study also investigated ways to improve classroom instruction in writing. A panel of teachers reviewed the anchor papers and the process of testing. Panel members re-scored the anchor papers. A second panel of teachers participated in a re-scoring of a sample of 100 text-based student writings per grade (without using anchor papers). Panel members also discussed related issues in test administration, test development, scoring, and classroom instruction. Results include: (1) two text-based writing prompts should not be given on the same day; (2) instructions should be written to draw students'  attention; (3) the new scores and the original scores on anchor papers were highly consistent in grades 3 and 5, and moderately high in grade 8 and grade 10; (4) passages should be engaging and the difficulty level should be consistent from year to year; (5) wording in the prompt should always direct students back to the text; (6) tenth grade teachers pointed out that most of the writing done by high school students is text-based, and that text-based writing is not a separate type of writing; (7) fifth grade teachers suggested that committees or teams develop questioning activities for teachers to use to improve students' performance on text-based writing; and (8) grade patterns for correlation coefficients were identified, with grade 3 being the lowest and grade 10 the highest. Changes  planned for the Spring 2001 writing assessment include: the range for the total writing scores will be 1 to 15; two text-based writing tasks will be administered on different days; a prewriting sheet and scratch paper will be provided; and the text-based writing prompts will be formatted closer to the stand-alone prompts.

        "description":"Since 1992, the Southeastern University and College Coalition for Engineering Education (SUCCEED) has been funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve undergraduate engineering education. Faculty from eight southeastern colleges of engineering have developed innovations in key focus areas such as freshmen engineering, design, tools for accreditation, partnerships, student mentoring, faculty development, integrated programs, and teaching with technology. The focus of this report is to chronicle the work of the Coalition since the last report in April, 2001. This report accounts for significant changes in infrastructure, curricula, and institutional priorities. Significant developments outlined in the Major Accomplishments section all address culture change. SUCCEED  continues to develop a cadre of faculty who are engineering education innovators. Partly due to the efforts of the program, the engineering education research community has strengthened in the past decade. In this report, special attention has been given to the number of ways that the community of innovators develop within SUCCEED. In addition to the qualitative changes, quantitative measures also point to the growth of this community. SUCCEED institutions contributed articles to engineering education in the past year. Another measure is the ability of SUCCEED faculty to obtain other funding for their educational research--$58 million in grants or endowments for educational research has already been identified from industrial, government, or foundation sources. Another $3,725,600 has been  given by industrial concerns as cash or in-kind contributions in situations in which a return is expected. In addition to cash support, students on such projects commonly work with a liaison provided by the company, a significant value that has not been estimated in these figures. While some of this support is difficult to document, the significant amount noted is a clear indication of lasting change. The results of a market survey helped SUCCEED identify both the types of innovation most in demand and the market channels through which schools would be receptive to that innovation. As a result, SUCCEED has reached a significant number of schools with its innovations in the past year through regional conferences and campus visits. (SOE)",

        "description":"This paper uses passages from Thomas Pynchon's novel, &quot;Gravity's Rainbow,&quot; to examine basic concepts, explaining that the process of identifying the basic word-concepts in literary texts is to some extent a tension between anticipation and unexpected frustration. The paper focuses on an interpretation of the basic concept &quot;paranoia&quot; from Pynchon's novel. It presents passages from the novel that illustrate a simultaneous realization of several meanings of paranoia, noting a metaphorical transformation of the basic meaning &quot;disease&quot; from the semantic structure of the medical term rendered by non-medical contextual meanings into the world-concept. It suggests that Pynchon is a living classic of American postmodernist literature, noting he has developed a postmodernist sensibility  that is a new cultural paradigm. The paper asserts that Pynchon rejects conventions and dogmas and makes the contexts of vision entirely new. This is achieved by stretching language and applying a method of pragmatic multiplicity. Molding the basic concepts, Pynchon presents an involuted case of the individual and his fate within the community. The paper concludes that Pynchon's postmodernist sensibility through his basic concepts can modulate paranoia into poetry and that the paranoid vision is extended across countries and time itself.

The paper dicusses the formal training and informal learning experiences of immigrant woman who are garment workers. A comparison of the results of the 1999 survey with those of similar surveys conducted in 1991 and 1993 revealed that the wages of sewing machine operators remained at the levels of the 1980s. Many subcontractors were circumventing the Employment Standards Act's provisions protecting home workers. Instead of receiving wage increases as they became more experienced, many home workers were actually &quot;punished&quot; for getting skilled. Most women were paid  by check every 2 weeks and reported few problems getting paid. Although many women preferred home work because it gave them more flexibility and a chance to combine paid work with child care, many others expressed feeling internal pressures from having to work all the time and meet the multiple demands of household, family, and employment. The following were among common problems reported by the women: (1) not learning the piece rate until garments were completed; (2) no vacation pay despite the legislative provisions calling for paid vacations; and (3) no avenues of compensation for work-related health problems (repetitive strain syndrome, back pain). Education of the public and policymakers and broad-based action on the part of homeworkers and the government are needed. (Contains 19  endnotes) (MN)",

The workshop focused on the specific context for IS developments in candidate countries, paying special attention to the following topics: infrastructures; info-structures; capabilities and skills; and assessment of the present IS in candidate countries. The workshop also examined transferable lessons from selected information and computer technology (ICT)- related experiences in the European Union's 15 member states.

The study is comparative in nature and took place in a workshop at the Adults Learning Maths Conference in Boston. The new members of the MEG professional development group were compared to the veteran members. It is observed that among the experienced MEG members, the ability to compute a division problem, create story problems, and reason mathematically and abstractly were higher than in other studies of U.S. teachers and the sample of new MEG members. It is concluded that it is only through comprehensive and ongoing staff development that all teachers can better understand, apply, and teach  mathematics to their students. (SOE)",

The mathematics portion of the Tests of Adult Basic Education (TABE) Summary Form was used as the evaluative instrument. Evidence for a lack of part-whole concept understanding as a hidden cause of innumeracy is reported. Data shows a trend of a higher final grade corresponding to better part-whole understanding at the start of the course. In light of this evidence, it is concluded that direct instruction of the part-whole concept should be part of adult basic math and algebra classes. (SOE)",

        "description":"Distance education--that is, offering courses by Internet, video, or other forms outside the classroom--has changed considerably in recent years and is a growing force in postsecondary education. More than a decade ago, concerns about fraud and abuse by some correspondence schools led to federal restrictions on, among other things, the percentage of courses a school could provide by distance education and still qualify for federal student aid. Given the recent changes in distance education, GAO (United States General Accounting Office) was asked to review the extent to which the restrictions affect schools' ability to offer federal student aid and the Department of Education's assessment of the continued appropriateness of the restrictions. Additionally, GAO was asked to look at  the extent to which accrediting agencies evaluate distance education programs, including their approach for assessing student outcomes. GAO recommends that Education provide data on the cost of waiving restrictions on distance education and develop guidelines with accrediting agencies and schools on assessing distance education quality. Appended are: Scope and Methodology; Comments from the Department of Education; and GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments. (Author/MA)",
